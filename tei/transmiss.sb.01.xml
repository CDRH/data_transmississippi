        <head type="sub">NAMED BY THE TRANSMISSISSIPPI CONGRESS</head>
        <head type="sub">Movement for a Great Western Exposition Takes on Shape and is Favored by All of the Members.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Today is the busy day of the Transmississippi congress. A vast amount of business still remains to be transacted, and although the time of the convention is more than half gone, scarcely a beginning has been made in discussing the various resolutions that have poured in since the first day's session. An effort is being made to finish most of the addresses today and with this end in view the congress was called to order an hour earlier than usual this morning. A number of free silver resolutions were read and referred; also a resolution calling upon the railroads to furnish delegates to the next congress a rate of not more than one fare for the round trip. On motion of Mr. Whitmore the rules were suspended and the latter resolution was adopted, and then came the first real clash of arms of the congress.</p>
    <p>Chairman Prince of the committee on resolutions reported favorably on a big bunch of resolutions, among which was the resolution declaring in favor of the free coinage of silver and which was submitted by W. J. Bryan yesterday. At this point John L. Webster of Omaha took the floor in behalf of a minority of the committee and presented the following:</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">FREE SILVER STRUCK A SNAG</head>
    
<p>Resolved, That we are in favor of true bimetallism, which consists in the largest possible use of both gold and silver as the standard money of the country compatible with the power of the nation to maintain the equal purchasing and debt-paying power of the two metals.</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That we are emphatically opposed to the free and unlimited coinage of silver a the ratio of 16 to 1, under present existing conditions; that such coinage would destroy the parity between the two metals; that the silver would drive the gold out of circulation, and thus destroy bimetallism and produce silver mono-metallism; therefore, be it further.</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That we believe this long continued agitation of the silver question has had much to do with the present financial depression, producing want of confidence, threatening the stability and permanency of price, and is a constant menace to he national credit, exciting apprehension abroad and uncertainty at home.</p>
    
<p>The discussion of the two reports was made an order of business later in the day.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">RESOLVED FOR MANY THINGS</head>
    
<p>Resolutions were then adopted declaring in favor of a strict enforcement of the Monroe doctrine and the completion of the Nicaragua canal under the direct supervision and control of the government; demanding this recognition of the Cubans as belligerents; the admission of New Mexico as a state; the appropriation of $500,000 by the next national congress for the purpose of an irrigation survey of the arid and semi-arid  regions of the west; declaring for the immediate  foreclosure of government mortgages on the Pacific roads, or else a reorganization on such lines as would only allow the railroads a reasonable degree of profit. W. J. Carlson of California presented a minority report on the latter resolution, in which he pointed out the utility of the railroads in developing the west, and urged that a settlement be effected on the merits of the case. The resolution was championed by President Bryan, who had originally introduced it. HE declared that the Union Pacific railroad was the most iniquitous corporation in this country. It had robbed the people, and even attempted to intimidate the United States courts. There was no reason why a congress of western business men should not go on record in opposition to this gigantic burden on the people. Mr. Carlson spoke at length in favor of the minority report, and after some further discussion and a general ventilation of opinions, both reports were referred back to the committee to see if they could not agree on a compromise report.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">BRYAN TALKS FOR OMAHA</head>
    
<p>Resolutions were also adopted in favor of a congressional appropriation for defending the harbor of San Diego by war vessels and fortifications, for the improvement of waterways and for a deep water harbor at San Pedro. A long resolution urging the various state governments to take legislative action relative to irrigation was submitted and referred.</p>
    
<p>The committee on ways and means recommended that the sum of $2 be assessed against each member of the congress for general expenses. Adopted.</p>
    
<p>At his point in the proceedings President Bryan asked unanimous consent to introduce the following memorial in behalf of the Nebraska delegation.</p>
    
<p>Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth-producing states, would be of great value, not only to the Transmississippi states, but to all the homeseekers in the world; therefor, be it</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That the United States congress be asked to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Transmississippi exposition in Omaha during the months of August, September and October in the year 1898, and that representatives of such states and territories in congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in carrying out this enterprise.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM</head>
    
<p>In explanation of the motion Mr. Bryan spoke briefly on the advantages which such an expansion would create for the west. The people of the east had no conception of the resources of the west. When they visited Chicago they thought that that was as far west as civilization extended. Such an exposition as was projected would bring thousands of these people to view the actual possibilities of the Transmississippi states.</p>
    
<p>Colonel John Doniphan of St. <choice><sic>Louis</sic> <corr type="handwritten">Joseph</corr></choice> urged the adoption of the resolution. He said no more appropriate place than Omaha could be selected at which to give an exposition of the growth, the products and the weather of the western country. Omaha was in itself a realization of the fondest dreams of the early statesmen of this nation. He briefly related the history of Nebraska and the surrounding states of which Omaha was once of the grandest triumphs. He urged unanimous action by the congress in favor of the resolution. His eloquent tribute to the west was received with hearty applause.</p>
    
<p>H. R. Whitmore <note><add>St Louis</add></note> spoke of the manner in which Omaha had entertained the congress and said that the least the delegates could do was to unanimously pass the resolution.</p>
<p>Rev. S. Wright Butler explained that it had been a pleasure for the people of Omaha to prepare for the entertainment of the congress, and then proceeded to put the delegates in good humor  by a few very pertinent witticisms, which stoked roars of laughter.</p>
    
<p>George Q. Cannon also seconded this proposition, and by this time a pronounced enthusiasm was manifested all over the hall.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">THEY ALL VOTED FOR OMAHA</head>
    
<p>Mr. Cannon said that fifty years ago he had roamed over he hills here Omaha now stands. Then the Indians occupied the territory undisturbed, and now he marveled to see the structures that had grown on the then barbecue soil in this half century. He declared that the city hall and The Bee building had impressed him with the enterprise of Omaha, and the disposition of its citizens to build up a great city on the banks of the Missouri.</p>    
    
<p>Other speakers expressed similar sentiments, and then the resolution was unanimously adopted by a rising vote, and amidst prolonged applause.</p>
    
<p>Mr. Bryan thanked the members of the congress for their enthusiastic support, and expressed the hope that they would never be compelled to regret their action.</p>
    
<p>It was nearly 12 o'clock when the regular order was reached. The first address was by Howell Jones of Topeka, Kan., who spoke on "The Advantage of Waterways to the Farmer." He took the ground that it was not more crops for the markets that the farmer needed, but more markets for the crops. The problem of shorter routes to the seaboard and to the Gulf of Mexico</p></div3>

<head type="sub">Banquet at Council Bluffs Where the Enterprise Was Discussed</head>
    
<p>The magnificent banquet at the Grand hotel, Council Bluffs, under the auspices of the Merchants' and Manufacturers' association has awakened a deep and general interest in the Transmississippi exposition enterprise. Everywhere, among all classes of people, only favorable comment was heard yesterday. All may be counted upon to induce the legislature to recognize the scheme and make the necessary appropriation. The only appropriation to be asked for is a sum sufficient to erect a suitable building in which the Iowa exhibit can be made. Not a dollar will be asked to help the work in any other way. It is felt to be a sure thing that if the Iowa legislature takes the proper steps toward recognizing the exposition, all other states will follow and its success will be assured.</p>
    
<p>President Odell selected the committee of eleven authorized by the Grand hotel meeting. These men are to act in conjunction with the same number of men appointed by the Commercial club of Omaha, and the whole number of twenty-two will constitute the executive committee, which will have the management of the big exposition when it is held.</p>
    
<p>President Odell, in notifying the gentlemen selected, sent to each the following business-like letter:</p>
    
<p>"Dear Sir: At a meeting of the Merchants' and Manufacturers' association held in the Grand hotel on the 22d inst., a resolution was adopted instructing me to select a committee of eleven members to cooperate with a similar committee appointed in Omaha to arrange and carry forward the project of a Transmississippi exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898. The resolution was suggested by members of the Omaha committee who were present at the meeting, and who assured our association that such a committee was declared by the,. I was given twenty-four hours in which to make up this committee and report it to the association. I have made the selection from members whom I think best qualified to perform the various duties that will from time to time devolve upon them, and in the list you will find your name."</p>

<p>The board of directors of the Transmississippi and International exposition and A. S. Hazelton, M. F. Rohrer, Mayor Cleaver, T. C. Dawson, W. W. Loomis, William Moore, E.  H. O'Dell, E. W. Hart and Victor Bender, members of the Council Bluffs committee, gathered about the banquet board in the Commercial club rooms last night. After discussing the menu, they gave the coming exposition a boost.</p>
    
<p>President Wattles of the Exposition company explained the object of the gathering by saying that while it was for the purpose of promoting and cementing the bonds of good fellowship between Omaha and Council Bluffs, it was also for the purpose of exchanging ideas concerning the best methods of preparing the preliminaries of the big show.</p>
    
<p>A. S. Hazelton of Council Bluffs stated that his city was ready to take hold of the matter and push it with influence, time and money. He said that he felt that anything that would help the great west would at he same time prove of lasting benefit to his city.</p>
    
<p>E. H. O'Dell urged that the time was ripe for action, and that steps should be taken at once to place the plans of holding the exposition before congress and the legislatures of Iowa and Utah. He felt that not only the state of Iowa would lend its assistance, but that every town and city would feel in duty bound to assist in making the exposition the greatest success of the age.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">COUNCIL BLUFFS READY.</head>
    
<p>M. F. Rohrer said that Council Bluffs could be depended upon to do its share. He urged that all of the members of the Transmississippi congress which convened in this city last November should be made to feel that the proposed exposition was largely due to their efforts, as it was that organization which first inaugurated the scheme.</p>
    
<p>G. H. Payne favored the plan of sending excursions to the cities in Iowa and adjoining states for the purpose of interesting the people in the exposition. The plan was frowned upon, the sentiment prevailing that more good could be accomplished through the newspapers.</p>
    
<p>The resolution adopted by the Transmississippi congress when it was in session in this city was read and adopted by the board of directors and the committee.</p>
    
<p>Mayor Cleaver of Council Bluffs said that the holding of the exposition was a stupendous undertaking and an important affair. "We must keep in touch with every member of the Transmississippi congress," he urges, "for it was through the efforts of that body that the scheme was first given birth. Those men brought it about, and I am sure that now they will stand by it to the end. If we can secure the combined efforts of the delegates to that congress, we can feel assured that the exposition will be a success. There is a vast amount of work to be done and to accomplish results, we must all work in harmony, and never allow the idea to prevail that this is a local affair. We mush not feel that the exposition is for Omaha, Council Bluffs, Nebraska, or Iowa, but instead, we must feel that it is the interest of every city west of the Mississippi river."</p>
    
<p>J. A. Wakefield spoke in favor of united effort, and urged that the plans for the exposition be called to the attention of the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Trade of Sioux City. He paid a tribute to the city at the mouth of Perry creek by declaring that the residents were always ready to take hold of a good thing, assisting with their money and their enterprise.</p>
    
<p>Dudley Smith said that he was heartily in favor of corresponding with the members of the Transmississippi congress and asking the members to put their shoulders to the wheel and give it a push. He thought that it would be a good plan to send a committee to Des Moines and call the attention of the Iowa legislature to the magnitude of the scheme. A resolution favoring the holding of the exposition , Mr. Smith thought, should be adopted by the legislature.</p>
    
<p>C. S. Montgomery urged that steps should be taken to get the matter properly before the Iowa legislature and in his judgement the thing to do was to have a committee appointed, not as lobbyists, but for the purpose of presenting the facts. "The exposition," said Mr. Montgomery, "should be supported by every state west of the Mississippi river.</p>
    
<p>"A bill looking to the securing of an appropriation of $50,000 has been introduced in congress by Senator Allen. Senator Thurston is ready and will do all in his power to push the matter along. The newly elected senators from Utah are with us. The $50,000 is only a start and before the end of reached we expect an appropriation of $150,000, $50,000 for the building and $100,000 for an exhibit. My judgement is that the senators from all of the states west of the Mississippi should meet and agree upon a line of action, and I understand that this will be done when the matter is properly called to their attention."</p>
    
<p>At this point Mr. Montgomery moved that a committee of three or five be appointed with the concurrence of the Council Bluffs Committee to go to Des Moines and interest the members of the Iowa legislature and the newspapers of the state.</p>
    
<p>Dan Farrell, jr., was of the opinion that the Council Bluffs committee could look after the Iowa plans.</p>
    
<p>Mr. Montgomery's motion was adopted and President Wattles announced that he would name the committee at some later date.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">BUREAU OF INFORMATION</head>
    
<p>Mr. Montgomery then moved that a committee of three or five be appointed to furnish information for the press and the public concerning the exposition, the committee to correspond with governors of states and mayors of cities in the transmississippi states. The motion prevailed and the president announced that he would name the committees in due time.</p></div3>

<p>Beside trying to pry open the United States treasury in aid of a mid-continent exposition, Omaha has a delegation on hand at Des Moines attempting to break into the state treasury of Iowa by means of an appropriation by the legislature now in session. The indications are that it will not be an easy job to induce the legislature to any liberality of that kind. A large number of the leading newspapers in that state have taken alarm, and in terms that have only one meaning are warning the legislature of the consequences of any such extravagance in favor of a city in a neighboring state. The trouble at the bottom of this whole matter is that for the last twenty years, Nebraska and Nebraska cities have been largely built up at the expense of Iowa and Iowa cities. Iowa, in that period, has pursued an intensely illiberal course in regard to the liquor question, which as had a marked unfavorable influence upon immigration, while Nebraska has pursued a contrary course upon that question. It has engendered a resentment that shows itself upon all occasions like the present, when Iowa is asked to aid financially in the matter of a mid-continent exposition, to be held at Omaha, immediately across the river from one of Iowa's chief cities, which has suffered most from the illiberal act of the state on the whisky question. If Iowa stands aloof from the exposition it will be difficult, and, perhaps, an impossible task to make the mid-continent exposition materialize in 1898, as now contemplated&#8212;St. Paul Dispatch.</p>
    
<p>The leading newspapers of Iowa have not antagonized the transmississippi congress project. In fact Iowa, like most other western states interested, shows a disposition to join in the enterprise.</p>
    
<p>Omaha does not give this exposition, and is not therefore asking for help.</p>
    
<p>Omaha is merely the place selected by the late transmississippi congress as the place where western states would hold an exposition.</p>
    
<p>Being so selected Omaha must bear the larger share of the burdens of the enterprise in the hope of being reimbursed in whole or in part by the benefits, direct or indirect.</p>
    
<p>Atlanta lost money by her experience with the southern states exposition. Omaha takes her chances.</p>
    
<p>The part the western states play in the enterprise is that which any partner plays. Each state will have its building and its exhibit. It will make its appropriation, not to help Omaha, but o be represented and help itself. The federal exhibit which congress is asked to provide is not to help Omaha, but to help the west. It is to be educational&#8212;to show to the people of the west those things which are connected with the government and which cannot otherwise be seen without a visit to Washington.</p>
    
<p>The St. Paul Dispatch should show a more liberal spirit&#8212;a more fair minded nature. Its owner, Mr. Thompson, is a liberal man, public spirited and enterprising. He should remember also that Nebraska assisted by her votes in locating the republication national convention in Minneapolis four years ago.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Work Begins for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898.</head>

<p>OMAHA, Neb., Jan. 23&#8212;The trans-Mississippi congress, which met in Omaha Nov. 25 last, adopted resolutions unanimously concurred in by delegates present from the trans-Mississippi states, locating the proposed trans-Mississippi exposition in 1898 at Omaha.</p>
    
<p>From that day leading men in Omaha and the congressional delegation from Nebraska have been busily engaged in pushing preliminary work incident to a full organization

of working forces. The exposition will not be, strictly speaking, an Omaha enterprise. The articles which were adopted at an enthusiastic mass meeting of Omaha citizens recently contemplate an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states and territories of the United Sates west of the Mississippi ricer, and also such exhibits as may be provided in the United States in any state of the union or any foreign country, for the purpose particularly of exhibiting to the world the products and capabilities of said states and territories. The articles provide that the exposition shall be opened in June and closed in November, 1898. The responsibility for the success of the enterprise must therefore devolve upon the vast empire embracing the western and Rocky mountain states.</p>
    
        <p>The people of this city and state, however, are determined that the project shall be pushed to a successful issue. It was left to them to take the initiative and to put the machinery in motion. To this task the citizens of Omaha have addressed themselves with energy and enthusiasm. The corporation is organized with a capital stock of $1,000,000, with shares at $10, there being a provision that when $10,000 of the stock shall have been subscribed business shall be commenced.

        At a recent meeting nearly $11,000 was subscribed by those present within a few minutes and strong committees named to secure further subscriptions. A board of eleven directors, as provided, was named, among them being the active and influential business men of the city. This board elected as their president G. W. Wattles, and as secretary John A. Wakefield.</p>
        
        <p>The first work to be assumed is that of enlisting the support of state legislatures in the trans-Mississippi states. Influential men will in a day or two be named as a committee to wait upon the legislature now in session in Iowa, and that of Utah, to present the merits and objects of the Trans-Mississippi exposition in person, and to solicit moral and substantial support from these states. Next winter the legislatures of all the western states will be visited in like manner. The hope and purpose is to secure an appropriation from each of these states.</p>

<ab>Gentlemen:--</ab>

<p>Herewith please find letter advising you that it is proposed to hold a great Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition at Omaha in 1898, and giving the action of the Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress as basis therefore, and asking your aid and influence with your representatives in Congress, toward securing adequate and generous appropriations for a National Building and a National Exhibit.

<p>We shall be obliged indeed if copy of the Resolutions be sent to your Representatives in Congress, and a copy sent, also, to this office.</p>
    
<p>Time is the essence of action and for good results, and we trust your action may be timely and commendatory.</p>

<ab>Dear Sir:&#8212;</ab>
    
<p>At the last session of the Trans-Mississippi Congress, which was held in Omaha in the month of November, 1895, the following resolution was unanimously adopted by a rising vote:</p>
    
<p>"WHEREAS, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the States west of the Mississippi River, made at some central gateway, where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth-producing States, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi States, but to all the home-seekers of the world, therefore,</p>
    
<p>RESOLVED, That the United States Congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September and October, in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such States and Territories in Congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases, to assist in carrying out his enterprise."</p>
    
<p>For the purpose of facilitating the work of the proposed exposition, a corporation has been organized under the style of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. Articles of association have been adopted, a copy of which we herewith enclose. The amount of capital stock necessary to begin business has been more than subscribed. Officers and directors have been elected, as noted above, and we are now ready for active work.</p>
    
<p>A bill has been introduced in Congress, asking for recognition from the National Government , and an appropriation for a government building and a national exhibit. We earnestly invite your aid in securing legalization form Congress at its present session. We hope you will realize the importance of this matter and correspond at once with your senators and representatives, urging upon them the necessity of prompt and liberal action. The great Trans-Mississippi country, with its vast undeveloped resources should not hesitate to ask for liberal recognition for an exposition of this character. We invite your co-operation in securing it.</p>
    
<p>It is the desire of this organization that steps be taken in each of the Trans-Mississippi Sates and Territories to recognize this enterprise, and to secure such legislation as may be necessary to properly exhibit the resources and products of the respective States and Territories. Organization is earnestly requested, and we invite correspondence and solicit your aid in making this exposition a complete success.</p>
    
<p>No such opportunity has ever before been offered the great west to advertise its resources and products to the world as this exposition will afford. Respectfully,</p>
    
<p>Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>

<head type="sub">The Trans-Mississippi Exposition.</head>
<ab>(Chicago Tribune.)</ab>
    
<p>A movement is on foot to hold a trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha in 1898, to be open six months. The purpose is to make a grand display of the resources of the whole country, by especially of the 

<figure n="illustration"/>

twenty-four states and territories west of the Mississippi river. It is the intention to let the world see what a magnificent region west of Chicago there is still to be developed and made the home of many millions of happy, prosperous people. It is hoped to make the exhibit as a whole second only in splendor to the great World's fair which was held in this city in 1893, and no effort will be spared to make it take rank in history.</p>
    
<p>The population of the states and territories west of the Mississippi river increased from 5,665,683 in 1870 to 14,215,409 in 1890, the proportion for the extremes of the twenty-year period being about 100 to 250. The gain in wealth was far greater, and the increase since 1890 is a large one. Roughly speaking one may say the population is three times that of a quarter of a century ago, which was soon after the completion of the Pacific railroad connection between the east and the far west. The development of that vast area has not much more than begun. Not only the precious metals but other minerals are being taken from the ground in vast quantities, and the artificial irrigation of soil in the semi-arid regions is being pushed with a vigor that promises soon to bring under cultivation untold millions of acres that a few years ago were vaguely alluded to as constituting a part of the "Great American Desert," never to be made of use to man, Twenty-five years since Nebraska, on the eastern edge of which the exposition of 1898 will be held, was thinly settled, with little or nothing beyond the distance of 150 miles west from the Missouri river, and west of that was literally a wilderness. Nebraska, now contains more than 1,000,000 people, with 1,000,000  acres of land under irrigation, and barns and farm houses extend all the way from the Missouri to Cheyenne. The then territories now are states, though not all of them merit that distinction. The population of Nevada was less than 46,000 in 1890, and now does not much exceed that total.</p>
    
<p>The population of Chicago has increased at even a greater pace. The census total for 1870 was 296,977 and that for 1890 was 1,208,669, or more than four times greater. The 1,750,000 persons now estimated to reside within the limits of Chicago are nearly six times as many as those of 1870. This similarity of development is far from being merely accidental. Chicago has been and still is the principal market of the vast trans-Mississippi area, and there is no reason to think it will not continue to be so, though several minor centers have sprung up and others may arise while the population of the area west of this city is trebling and quadrupling as it must be expected to do in the course of the next few years. Undoubtedly this further filling up will be reflected into this city as its principal focus, though the similar cities of Omaha, Kansas City, Denver, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis and St. Paul, Des Moines and St, Louis also will share in the development. So Chicago is greatly interested in all that tends to foster the industrial activities of the area beyond the Mississippi, and its people, with those of other portions of Illinois, ought to take an active part in the exposition. A local company has been organized at Omaha for preliminary work, but each state will be asked to recognize and cooperate, and a bill offered by Senator Allen now is pending in congress, the object of which is to make the work of the organized directory more comprehensive and effective than it otherwise would be.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">SHARE THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE</head>
<head type="sub">Measure Provides for a Building and Exhibit by the United States&#8212;Local Movement is Active.</head>
    
<p>Members of the Transmississippi Exposition association are now beginning their work in earnest, looking to the holding of the exposition in this city in the summer and fall of 1898. The officers of the association have been elected, committees have been appointed and meetings to devise ways and means to push the project are being held almost daily. Encouragement is being received from many of the states of the transmississippi country, and the projectors of the big show feel assured that they will meet with success in their undertaking.</p>
    
<p>The bill providing for the holding of the Transmississippi exposition was introduced in the United States senate by Senator Allen January 3, read twice and referred to the select committee on international expositions, of which Senator Thurston is the chairman. The bill is:</p>
    
<p>A bill to authorize and encourage the holding of a Transmississippi exposition at the city of Omaha, in the state of Nebraska, in the year 1898, and make an appropriation therefor.</p>
    
<p>Whereas, It is desirable to encourage the holding of a Transmississippi exposition at the city of Omaha, in the state of Nebraska, in the year 1898, for the exhibition of the resources of the United States of America and the progress and civilization of the western hemisphere, and for a display of the arts, industries, manufacturers and products of the soil, mine and sea; and</p>

<p>Whereas, Encouragement should be given to an exhibit of the arts, industries, manufacturers and products, illustrative of the progress and development of that and other sections of the country: and</p>

<ab>Atlanta, Ga. Jan. 31st, 1896.</ab>
    
<ab>Mr. G. H. Hitchcock, Pres. World Publishing Co., Omaha Neb.</ab>
    
<ab>Dear Sir:</ab>
    
<p>Replying to yours of the 27th inst., I send you by this mail a copy of the Constitution containing the official report of the amount of receipts from all sources, for the Cotton States and International Exposition. This answers your first question.</p>
    
<p>Replying to your second question the total amount appropriated fro the exposition was as follows:- By the city $75,000; by the country, work from the county convicts in grading etc. to the value of $75,000 the county being Constitutionally inhibited in making a direct appropriation; from the state $17,500 and from the federal government, $200,000. Eight other states made appropriations for state displays; these appropriations ranging form $15,000 to $38,000.</p>
    
<p>Replying to your third question, the total amount of disbursements &amp;c. cannot be exactly ascertained until the report of the finance committee is presented, which will be done in the course of a few days. The total amount of such disbursements, however, did not exceed the total receipts more than about $25,000-- that is, it will not when we have realized on the remaining assets now in hand. This difference will be made good by the directors and the exposition will make settlement for every dollar it owes.</p>
    
<p>As to my opinion on the profit derived by the city from the exposition, there is no possible doubt that the investment paid a hundred dollars for every one made by the city and by individual subscribers. In addition tot he subscriptions above mentioned, the personal cash subscription raised in the city amounted to $125,000. When the official report of the finance committee is submitted, I will see that you are provided with a copy of the same.</p>
    
<ab>Very truly yours,</ab>
    
<ab>Clark Howell</ab>
        </div2>

<p>RESOLVED, That we look with favor upon the plan to hold a Transmississippi Congress and International Exposition at Omaha, in 1898.</p>

<p>Passed unanimously by the Upper Des Moines Editorial Association at its meeting at Boone, Iowa, Feb. 7, 1896.</p>

    <div3>
<p>The Constitution gives today the financial story of the fair.</p>
    
<p>The receipts from every source for every day are given, and they make a study of absorbing interest.</p>
    
<p>Will the Cotton States and International exposition pay out?</p>
    
<p>When a member of the board of directors or any other exposition official is seen on the street this is the first question fired at him. Everywhere there is the keenest interest over the financial result of the fair.</p>
    
<p>"All we lacked," said Mr. Sam Inman yesterday morning, "was the attendance of 500,000 more people."</p>
    
<p>"When all our assets are counted in I think the gap will be covered up," said President Collier.</p>
    
<p>From the tone of the estimates given by the most prominent directors there is a sanguine spirit over the financial result, and while the attendance did not come up by many thousands to the original estimate, yet through the close economy and splendid management of the finance committee the affairs of the fair are not in such a dilapidated condition as they promised to be several months ago.</p>
    
<p>Taking in the reports from all departments the total receipts will amount to $487,621.85.</p>
    
<p>The figures yesterday in Chief Felder's office showed a total attendance during the fair of 1,286.863.</p>
    
<p>The attendance in detail was shown as follows:</p>

<head type="sub">Work of Packing Going on in All of the Buildings Rapidly.</head>
<head type="sub">WHAT OF THE MISSING DECISIONS</head>
<head type="sub">Foreign Exhibitors Solicitous Over the Delay of the Report of the International Jury.</head>
<div3>
<p>There was an air of desolation everywhere yesterday on the exposition grounds in spite of the long procession of wagons that rumbled continually about the plank road. It was a deserted city and wore the appearance of a cemetery. Occasionally a stray wanderer would pass across the plaza and hurry on to get away from the dismal surroundings. The wonted music of the Midway was hushed. The Midway itself was vacant. A belated spieler jocosely addressed an imaginary was free of charge</p>
    
<p>Inside the buildings, however, there was a scene of lively activity. The exhibitors were rushing to get away their goods. In the agricultural hall many of the exhibits were dismantled in the forenoon. The commissioners from Arkansas, Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida were working with coats off.</p>
    
<p>In the fine arts building many of the pictures were taken down and cased for shipment. It will be some weeks before the foreign section in the manufactures and liberal arts hall is disturbed. A small crowd of shoppers still haunted the place yesterday and the wares were going at a great reduction.</p>
    
<p>In all of the other buildings the exhibitors were working like beavers. The quickest work was done in the government building. Yesterday afternoon this building presented an entirely different appearance. A large force of rained workmen have been employed and Uncle Sam will be among the first to get off his display.</p>
</div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">Mr. Inman on the Scene.</head>
    
<p>In the offices in the administration building there was still work to be done. Mr. Sam Inman came out at 2 o'clock and held consultation over financial affairs. Captain James Wylie, who has proved one of the most able financiers and devoted his time incessantly to the affairs of the exposition, was there, too, directing in the different departments and advising. The duties of General Manager Smith were finished. His office was vacant and he was back again at his law practice down town. Secretary Lewis was engaged in writing out permits to exhibitors to remove their exhibits. Chief Tyler, of the transportation department, had his hands full again. Mr. Collier sat in his office&#8212;a lone sentinel. The executive work of the exposition has been vested entirely in him. He is now the head and front of the whole fair.</p>
    
<p>"I am glad," he said, "that the great strain of work is over. It seems a relief, but then we can't help feeling sorry that it has all passed and it seems a pity to wipe away such a beautiful place as this. But the exposition has accomplished a great deal. Socially it has been a great benefit to the people of Atlanta. We will know each other better hereafter. It has been a kind of mirror reflecting and bringing out the qualities of those connected with it. It has been a wonderful developer. I really regret to see it close. I feel like there is something missing. It almost seems that some close relative had died. In many respects I am sorry to see the end come."</p>
    
<p>A gloomy atmosphere overshadowed the whole park. The exposition is dead. In a few weeks there will be nothing but a row of vacant buildings left.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">What of the Awards?</head>
    
<p>There is urgent inquiry and much solicitude among the exhibitors of the foreign section over the delay of the decision of the international jury of awards. The jury did its work a month <unclear reason="torn"/> and many think that there is some <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

<p>terror. It had words in it as long as a dictionary, but I hurried up and slid through them, and was doing pretty well, when I looked down the page and saw a lot of Spanish proper names. Now, I don't know Spanish from Apache, but I was going about a hundred words a minute, so without stopping I gave them two verses of a little German poem I had learned when a boy, and hang me if a man in that hall seemed to know the difference except Congressman Niedringhaus, of St. Louis. You ought to have seen him laugh when he heard his native tongue worked off on the house of representatives for Spanish.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">A Study in Ancestors</head>
    
<p>From The Chicago Record.</p>
    
<p>A southside man tells a good story on himself. He comes of revolutionary stock and his family for several generations back has been prominent in New York state, but he has never worried much about his ancestry, having been too busily engaged in trapping the unwary dollar. His wife comes of good old Virginia stock and knows all about her lineage. She has frequently insisted that her husband make some effort to trace his family history, of which he could give no earlier account than that one of his ancestors moved from Massachusetts to Connecticut about 1760. As the family name is thoroughly English she believes it possible that this ancestor came in direct line from some old Pilgrim settler. At last the husband yielded to her persuasions and wrote to a "specialist" in the east to find out what he could about the family in Massachusetts prior to 1760. In the course of a few weeks he received a letter reporting process. The man who digs up family histories said he has obtained a clew. He had learned from early records that in &#8211;, Mass., in 1685 one James &#8212; enjoyed the unique distinction of being the first prisoner to occupy a newly built jail, the charge against him begin the theft of a cask of rum. "My dear," said the husband, after he ad read the report to his horrified wife, "we haven't got far enough along to prove that James &#8212; was a relative of ours, but I think we can do it with a little more research." "The investigation has gone far enough," said she. Now when she tells of her husband's family history, she is content to dwell on the revolutionary period.</p>

<p>When the last report was <unclear reason="torn"/> sent on to President Gilm<unclear reason="torn"/> and it was expected that it would be turned in a few days, in time at <unclear reason="torn"/> to make the announcement before <unclear reason="torn"/> closing of the exposition The foreign exhibitors have been waiting in vain and there is much dissatisfaction among them over the delay. Secretary Lewis has telegraphed to President Gilman, but nothing definite has been ascertained yet. It is the opinion of President Collier that the delay is caused by the fact that before returning the report President Gilman forwarded it to Washington to be recorded as a part of the report of the original jury. This places the delay with the secretary of the first jury.</p></div3>

<p>Dr. Gustavo Niederlein, the commissioner of Argentine Republic, will return to Philadelphia in a few days for the purpose of placing the exhibits secured at the Atlanta exposition in the Philadelphia Commercial museum. He has in charge <unclear reason="torn"/> collection of exhibits for that enterpr<unclear reason="torn"/> and has been active in getting the mo<unclear reason="torn"/> interesting display at the Atlanta fair.</p>

<p>A variety of objects from the Georgia exhibits will be taken off and every coun<unclear reason="torn"/> will be more or less represented. He has secured contributions from each state building here and obtained in full the exhibits of the Georgia railroad and that <unclear reason="torn"/> Venezuela.</p>
    
<p>All of these will be forwarded as so<unclear reason="torn"/> as possible to Philadelphia and put <unclear reason="torn"/> the Commercial Museum. This enterprise is one of the biggest of its kind ever attempted in the United States and promises great good.</p></div3>

<p>Commissioners A. Macchi and R. Saul<unclear reason="torn"/> of the foreign section, were complimented yesterday by a vote of thanks of the foreign exhibitors. All of the representatives of the different countries called on each gentleman and presented them with a formal certificate of thanks.

<p>Mr. Saulay is a French journalist and a man of rare culture and strong intelle<unclear reason="torn"/> There was no mercenary motive in <unclear reason="torn"/> coming to Atlanta.

        <dateline>THE IOWA STATE REGISTER<lb/> TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1896.</dateline>

<head type="main">TRANS-MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION</head>
    
<head type="sub">Committee of Council Bluffs and Omaha Gentleman Here to Place it Before the Assembly.</head>
    
<head type="sub">Hon. Alvin Sanders, the Chairman of the Committee, in an Interview, Talks of Objects of Exposition.</head>
    
<head type="sub">Will Show to the World What the Great States West of the Mississippi Can Do&#8212;Want Iowa's Help.</head>
    
<p>A committee of Council Bluffs and Omaha gentlemen reached the city last night and are stopping at the Savery. They are here to wait upon the legislature in the interest of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. They say it is the intention to make it the greatest display of the resources of the western states and territories the world has ever seen.</p>
    
<p>The chairman of the delegation is the Hon. Alvin Saunders, the war governor of Nebraska and ex-United States senator of Iowa be voted for Grimes and Harlan. Mr. Saunders came to Iowa, when it was the territory of Wisconsin and assisted in framing the constitution under which it was admitted into the Union. He had the honor of being the youngest member of the constitutional convention. As the readers of The Register will be pleased to learn the object of his mission, he has kindly favored us with the following interview:</p>

<p>"Senator, when did you reach Des Moines?"</p> 
  
<p>"This evening. Our committee, consisting of Mr. G. W. Wattles, president of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Company; Judge Winfield S. Strawn, J. A Wakefield, S. T. Lindsay and myself, of Omaha, and E. H. Odell, president of the Merchants and Manufacturers' Association; C. R. Hannan, cashier Citizens' State Bank; Hon. I. M. Treynor, W. G. Moore and T. C. Dawson, is visiting Des Moines to interest the people of Iowa, through the legislature, and the citizens of Des Moines in providing for an exhibit of the resources and development of Iowa, at the exposition to be held at Omaha in the summer and fall of 1898."</p>
    
<p>"What is the purpose of the exposition?"</p>
    
<p>"It is to show to the world the riches of the magnificent country west of the Mississippi River and its wonderful development from the time all this vast region was under territorial government up to the present time. Few can realize the grandeur of its progress and prosperity since I located at Mount Pleasant in your state.  Iowa was then the territory of Wisconsin. I was a member of the convention that framed the constitution admitting Iowa into the Union. I believe I was the youngest member of that body. At that time Iowa was a comparative wilderness, and west of the Missouri river the Indian and the buffalo held undisputed  sway. Look at it now and see what "God hath wrought." It is the purpose of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition to make a display of the wonders wrought by these changes west of the great river on your eastern borders."</p>
    
<p>"How may states will be included in the exposition?"</p>
    
<p>"All who wish to make exhibits. The Trans-Mississippi region will be fully represented. This consists of twenty-four states and territories. But every state in the Union, as well as foreign nations, will be invited to make displays. A bill introduced by Senator Allen, of Nebraska, is now pending in congress covering all these points."</p>
    
<p>"Have any organized bodies and individuals given their endorsement of the exposition?"</p>
    
<p>"Yes. The Chicago Tribune had a fine editorial on the subject last Saturday week, urging the people of Illinois to do everything for its success, and showing the remarkable growth of Chicago and that state since 1800 by reason of the growth of the Trans-Mississippi region. The Nebraska State Press Association, the Nebraska beet sugar convention and other organizations in that state and in Iowa have given it unanimous endorsement. The Trans-Mississippi congress also endorsed it unanimously. It will have no connection with any financial or political movement. It is purely a commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprise."</p>
    
<p>"Will the management be local?"</p>
    
<p>"By no means. The present company is one merely to carry on the work until arrangements are completed . That will consist of a president, a resident vice president and twenty-four vice-presidents, one from each state and territory west of the Mississippi river. We hope to make the exposition  second only in splendor to the Worlds' Fair and its permanent effect will be to still more rapidly develop and enrich the states reaching from the Mississippi to the Pacific Coast. And Iowa will be no means be one of the least of these. Your state is especially favored by Providence, and as I am more familiar with its western half, it is a marvel of fertility, health, natural beauty and abundance.</p>
    
<p>"What is the trans-Mississippi congress?"</p>
    
<p>"It is a body of representative business and public spirited men living in the states this side of the Mississippi who meet frequently in one city or another to discuss means and   measures to promote the development of this section of the country. All creeds and opinions mingle and discuss, but in everything tending to promote the prosperity of the trans-Mississippi region they are a unit. This accounts for the great exposition of the western states. The congress realized its vital importance to the West, and single standard, double standard, high tariff and free trade men voted for our city."</p>
    
<p>"By the way, senator, have you any objection to giving us your preference and that of your state people on the presidential question?"</p>
    
<p>"Well, so far as that is concerned, our people are not positively fixed on any candidate. The withdrawal of ex-President Harrison from the race, or rather I should say his notice to the party that he will not be a candidate for the office, will, evidently, cause may changes in Nebraska, for the general has may warm friends there, who will now turn to others. Governor McKinley has a strong following there on account of his strong position on the tariff question, but I must think that many of the heretofore Harrison men will naturally look to Senator Allison as their next choice. Indeed, the senator is highly esteemed by all our people, and he is looked upon as absolutely sage. Then, again, it was Senator Allison's friends who came to Harrison's aid in 1888, at an opportune time, and our people have not forgotten it."</p>

<head type="sub">Legislature to Endorse the Transmississippi Exposition Plan Today.</head>
    
<head type="sub">OMAHA COMMITTEE WARMLY WELCOMED</head>
    
<head type="sub">Governor Saunders Given an Ovation in Both Houses and Assured of Earnest Support by Governor Drake.</head>
    
<p>DES MOINES, Feb. 11&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;An enthusiastic meeting was held this afternoon at the Savery house in the interest of the Transmississippi exposition at Omaha. The delegation from Omaha met members of the legislature, with Governor Drake and Lieutenant Governor Parrott were present. Governor Drake was made chairman. A resolution was presented, which will be offered as a joint resolution to eh legislature and will be adopted. Its adoption was moved by Speaker Byers of the house. It is as follows:</p>
    
<p>Whereas, Delegates representing the twenty-four states west of the Mississippi river, at the Transmississippi congress of 1895, adopted a resolution providing for the holding of an exposition of the products, manufactures, arts and industries of these states and territories; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, The said convention voted to hold said exposition at Omaha, Neb., in 1898; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, The common interests of the states and territories constituting the great region will be promoted thereby, and the interests of the state of Iowa, lying at its gateway, will be especially benefited by such an exposition on its borders; therefore, be it</p>
    
<p>Resolved, By the general assembly of Iowa that the holding of the said Transmississippi exposition is heartily approved, and that the people of Iowa are urged to co-operate with the people of the other states of the transmississippi region, and with those of her neighbor, and take this opportunity of making a fitting display of their resources; and be it further</p>
    
 <p>Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the senators and representatives from Iowa in the national congress with the request that they promote as far as possible the said exposition.</p>  

<p>Speeches were made on the resolutions by Governor Saunders of Nebraska, Lieutenant Governor Parrott, Judge Strawn, Speaker Byers, I. M. Treynor, J. A. Wakefield, Senator Palmer, President Pro Tem A, B. Funk of the senate, and others.</p>
    
<p>Both houses of the legislature accorded a warm welcome to a committee form Omaha today. It came for the purpose of presenting the Transmississippi exposition to the Iowa legislature. Governor Saunders was escorted to the chair in both houses and was given an ovation. In the senate he was incited to address the body by Lieutenant Governor Parrott, and briefly set forth the plan and scope of the Transmississippi exposition. The resolution will pass without opposition.</p>

<p>Speaker Byers created a sensation this  morning by cutting short the reading of a resolution from Brooklyn Grand Army post, which in most vigorous language condemned the action of the Monument Commission in making the selections of representative soldiers for portraits and medallions. The speaker said that "he wanted it to be distinctly understood that hereafter he would permit no petition or resolution read from the clerk's desk which would in any way reflect on the Monument Commission." The Grand Army posts are sending in their replies to the inquiries sent out to them by order of the house in regard to the finishing touches to be placed on the monument. The posts so far heard from are unanimously in favor of keeping off all portraits, medallions and names of individual officers and private soldiers and wish the monument to be surmounted with an appropriate emblem of peace&#8212;not war. In respect to other details there is some difference of opinion, as well as on the proposition of removal to some more commanding location.</p></div1>
    
<div1><head type="sub">PROHIBS IN THE SENATE UNEASY</head>
    
<p>It is generally conceded that the sentiment in the senate in favor of resubmission is on the increase, though the most sanguine friends of he measure do not claim to have the necessary number of votes to insure its passage. The senators who have all along been regarded as favorable to resubmission are Bell, Berry, Byers, Carney, Cheshire, Druet, Eaton, Ericson, Gilbertson, Gorrell Harriman, Henderson, Hotchkiss, Junkin, Kilburn, Mitchell, Palmer, Perrin, Phelps and Rowen&#8212;20. The "hopefuls" are Senators Allyn, Blanchard, Carroll, Carpenter, Ellison, Healy, Penrose, Sargeant and young, Of these Allyn, Blandchard, Carroll and Ellison are now  thought to be reasonably certain to support resubmission, which would leave the resubmissionists only two votes short. Strong influences are being brought to bear upon Senators Carpenter, Healy, Penrose and Young to bring them over to the support of the resolution, but so far none of these senators have given any indications as to their final action. There is a suspicion among the more cautious resubmissionists that they are being led into a trap. They fear that if the resubmission resolution is held in committee too long to get a position high enough up on the general files to be reached in regular order that it may be left "dangling in mid air" when the legislature adjourns. It is no secret that if this important resolution is subjected to the tender mercies of Matt Parrot's "sifting committee" it will be crucified without any compunction. The knowledge of this fact may put the friends of resubmission on guard against any unnecessary delay. As the situation now stands, they have control of things and can choose their own time to take up the matter in committee.</p>
    
<p>While the senate has declined to give the code revision the right of way on the floor, yet the standing committees in many instances have practically set aside the new bills introduced and are bending their energies to a consideration of the code, hoping to get the report in proper shape to be reported back to the senate and placed on the general files by the 1st of march. The action of the standing committee, which is usually conclusive, affords little indication of what final disposition of the code report will be made by the senate itself, or what changes may be approved, as each member reserves the right to antagonize any bill that may come up, thought no opposition was offered to it in committee. This course is taken merely for the purpose of facilitating the work of the session, for if factious opposition were made in the committee, bills could b hung up for weeks, and the disputes and wrangles engendered in committee rooms would be intensified when the bill comes up for action in the senate.</p>
    
<p>Senator Pusey, in examining the new code, discovered that the railway bridges at Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Burlington, Keokuk, Clinton, Davenport and Dubuque were simply taxed as part of the mileage of the railways, instead of separately, as now provided. The ways and means committee restored the old law. Had the discovery not been made the cities named would have lost a large amount of revenge.</p>
    
<p>The senate committee on cities and towns reported favorably on the Harper bill, authorizing cities of the first class to lay sidewalks through agricultural lands and tax the cost to abutting property by a vote of three-fourths of the city council.</p></div1>
    
<div1><head type="sub">BLOW AT THE DRUG STORES.</head>
    
<p>Representative M. J. Davis of Cass, himself a druggist, is an earnest supporter of a bill to prohibit sales of lager beer by drug stores. He says physicians seldom or never prescribe lager beer as a medicine, and it can easily be procured at the saloons, or by the keg if needed in quantities. Representative Early says he has no objection to druggists selling beer, but he insists on their paying the $6 mulct tax, assessed against saloon keepers.</p>
    
<p>The house killed the bill introduced by Doubleday, requiring the assessor to take the price last paid for the land in question or the price recently paid for adjoining farms as the basis of assessment for purposes of taxation. Mr. Doublesday made a lengthy argument in favor of the bill, but objection was made to the measure on the ground that is enacted into law it would upset all efforts at uniformity in rates in different localities and work injustice in many cases.</p>
    
<p>The house refused to vote the pay for the unexpired term of Judge L. O. Hatch, deceased, of the McGregor district, to his widow, Speaker Byers ruling that it required a two-thirds majority.</p>

<p>The bills introduced in the house and senate were all legalizing acts or referred to matters of only minor importance. Bills on all sorts of subjects never intended for any serious consideration are being introduced "by request."</p>

<p>The senate took up and passed the chapters of hte code providing for the organization of state militia and the regulation of military companies without any material amendments.</p>-->

    <div3>
<p>An enthusiastic meeting was held this afternoon at the Savery in the interest of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. It was composed of a delegation from Omaha, Neb., and Council Bluffs, and members of the legislature. The representatives from Omaha were Ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, Judge W. S. Strawn, G. W. Wattles, L. T. Lindsey and J. A. Wakefield; from Council Bluffs, C. R. Hannan, E. H. Odell, I. M. Treynor, Wm. Moore, T. C. Dawson, E. F. Test and D. B. Dailey.

Palmer, Funk, Hauger, Hinman, Crow, Grote, McDonald, Potter, Chapman, Frink, Gurley, Speaker Byers, Lieutenant Governor Matt. Parrott and Gov. F. M. Drake.</p>
    
<p>Governor Drake was made chairman and J. M. McLaughlin secretary of the meeting. The following joint resolution was presented relative to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., in 1898:</p>
    
<p>Whereas, Delegates representing the twenty-four states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river, at the Trans-Mississippi Congress of 1893, adopted a resolution providing for the holding of an exposition providing fro the holding of an exposition of the produce of the products, manufactures, arts and industries of these states and territories; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, The said convention voted to hold the said exposition at Omaha, Nebraska, in the year 1898; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, The common interest of the states and territories constituting this great region will be promoted thereby, and the interests of the state of Iowa, lying at its gateway, will be especially benefitted by such an exposition on her borders; be it therefore</p>
    
<p>Resolved, By the general assembly of the state of Iowa, that the holding of the said Trans-Mississippi Exposition is heartily approved, and that the people of the other states of the trans-Mississippi region, and with those of her neighbor, and to take this opportunity of making a fitting display of their resources; and be it further</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the senators and representatives from Iowa in the National congress by the secretary of state, with the request that they promote as far as possible the said exposition.</p>
    
<p>Mr. Byers moved its adoption, and that the chairman, Gov. Drake appoint one member form the senate and the speaker of the house as the committee. Speeches were made by ex-Governor Saunders, Matt. Parrott, Judge Strawn, Speaker Byers, I. N. Treynor, J. A. Wakefield, Senator Palmer, Col. Dailey and Representative Funk.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">SURVIVING WAR GOVERNOR</head>
    
<p>In the morning Governor Saunders visited the senate and was invited to speak. Senators Pusey and Mitchell were appointed a committee to escort him to the platform. He was a member of the Iowa senate from 1854 to 1858 and was the youngest member of the convention which framed the constitution admitting Iowa into the Union. He left Iowa for Nebraska and shortly after became the war governor of that state. He is the only war governor alive.</p>
    
<p>HE said: "I was an early settler in Iowa, and at one time I knew every politician in the state. I was raised a farmer boy and had little bu ambition for politics. But I became greatly interested in making the boundaries of the state as they are now and was sent to the convention for that purpose. The part I took in making the present map of the state started me in politics. All that old war governors are gone save myself. For a while Curtin, of Pennsylvania, Governor Kirkwood, of this state and myself were the only ones left. They have both gone and I alone survive. I wish that the people of Iowa may always prosper, for no matter where I am, my heart is always warm towards your state."</p></div3>

<head type="sub">TRANS-MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION.</head>
    
<ab>(Des Moines Register.)</ab>
    
<p>Ex-Governor Alvin Saunders of Nebraska is a man of full stature, mentally and physically. His striking personality and mental force promptly gained respectful consideration of the trans-Mississippi exposition presented to the Iowa legislature by the committee of Omaha and Council Bluffs gentlemen. Des Moines and all Iowa were honored by their presence here, as they will be at the trans-Mississippi exposition in Omaha in 1898.</p>
    
<p>Nebraska and Iowa people are practically one people in sentiment and environments, and they should labor energetically and unitedly to gain the mutual benefits to be derived from that exposition. New Orleans and Atlanta have had national recognition and aid for expositions, Nashville is to have proportionate recognition and assistance this year, and there is no reason why Nebraska and Iowa should not be equally well served in their trans-Mississippi exposition of 1898.</p>
    
<p>All Iowa people who had the pleasure of seeing and hearing ex-Governor Saunders and the other members of the committee were greatly pleased over the strength and character of the men who were sent here to interest the Iowa legislature and people in that important movement fro an exposition that will demonstrate the unequaled resources and productiveness of the most favored and prolific region of the world.</p>
    
<p>The committee returned well pleased with the results of their mission here, for they received undoubted proof of the earnest and active co-operation of the people of Iowa to make the trans-Mississippi exposition at least equal to any similar exposition in the history of the United States.</p></div2>
    
<div2><head type="sub">NEBRASKA SENDS GREETING TO IOWA.</head>
    
<p>Nebraska sends greeting to Iowa. The splendid treatment the trans-Mississippi exposition committee received from the legislature, the newspapers and the citizens of that great state was gratifying. As Omaha has been equally honored by the representatives of Iowa and the remaining western states and territories as the city in which the great exposition of the west is to be held, the cordiality and graceful attention tendered to the committee by Iowa's leading representative men comes with peculiar gratification to the people of this city, for which they are thankful, and which they profoundly appreciate.</p>
    
<p>The people of Nebraska ought not to lose any opportunity to reciprocate these friendly and cheering words unanimously spoken by the Iowa senate and house of representatives:</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, Delegates representing the twenty-four states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river, at the Trans-Mississippi Congress of 1893, adopted a resolution providing for the holding of an exposition providing fro the holding of an exposition of the produce of the products, manufactures, arts and industries of these states and territories; and</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, The said convention voted to hold the said exposition at Omaha, Nebraska, in the year 1898; and</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, The common interest of the states and territories constituting this great region will be promoted thereby, and the interests of the state of Iowa, lying at its gateway, will be especially benefitted by such an exposition on her borders, therefore, be it</p>
    
<p>Resolved, By the general assembly of the state of Iowa, that the holding of the said Trans-Mississippi Exposition is heartily approved, and that the Senators and Representatives in Congress from Iowa are requested to co-operate with the Senators and Representatives from our sister sate, Nebraska, and the other trans-Mississippi states in procuring the passage at this session of Congress of a bill gibing national recognition to said exposition, and providing for an appropriation for a national exhibit and the necessary and proper buildings to contain the same;  and be it further</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be certified by the Secretary of State under the seal of the state and sent to the Senators and Representatives in Congress form Iowa.</p>
    
<p>Iowa is a grand state. Many of its young men and women have settled in Nebraska, and in every locality they are honored and respected by our people. They have risen to eminence in many cases and everywhere they are prominent in our political, commercial, agricultural, industrial and religious life. One of Iowa's honored sons is the senior senator from this state, and another, who has just been received by the Iowa legislature with distinguished honor, has been governor, United States senator, and enjoys the distinction of being one of the founders of these two great commonwealths.</p>
    
<p>Nebraska cherishes the warmest regard for Iowa, both by ties of blood and mutual interests. As the Des Moines Register says, Nebraska and Iowa people are practically one people in sentiment and environments and they should labor energetically and unitedly for an exposition that will demonstrate the unequaled resources and productiveness  of the most favored and prolific region of the world and make the trans-Mississippi exposition in the history of the United States. This will meet with ready response in every city and hamlet of Iowa and Nebraska.</p>
    
<p>On more than one occasion Senator Gear of Iowa has shown his warm friendship for Omaha, and but a few days since he exerted his powerful influence in favor of the exposition by the people of his state. Since Senator Allison has become a member of the United States congress he has voted for the admission of twelve trans-Mississippi states, and as chairman of the senate appropriations committee millions of public money have been set aside for improvements in the trans-Mississippi states and territories. In the national house of representatives all of the Iowa delegation are showing their friendliness to Omaha and Nebraska in expressing their favorable consideration for this city and state in their aspirations, and the success of the great exposition.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Central Labor Union Favors a Trans-Mississippi Exposition for Omaha.</head>
    
<dateline>SUNDAY WORLD-HERALD: OMAHA, FEBRUARY 16, 1896.</dateline>
    
    <head type="sub"><unclear/> and Request Adoption</head>
    
<head type="sub">The Resolutions Representing Wishes of Several Millions of People Will Then Be Sent to Congress.</head>

<p>(The secretaries of all labor unions in Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs are requested to send weekly notices of their union meetings, names of officers elected, notes on increase or decrease of membership, socials, dances or entertainments and any and all items of interest to working men to the Labor Editor, World-Herald, before Thursday of each week. All such items will be published in this column.</p>
    
<p>Adopting the plan proposed in this column two weeks ago, the Central Labor union at its meeting last Wednesday night, unanimously adopted the following resolutions.</p>
    
<p>Whereas, The plan of co-operation is one of the most powerful means of disseminating knowledge and procuring advancement, and the most effectual for furthering the welfare of all classes, and that one thing necessary for bringing this about is for the people of one part of the country to make known to those in other parts the products of their enterprise and their natural resources; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, A general exposition of what we have and are capable of producing would bring ta the knowledge of the world our merited standing, thereby placing us upon an equal footing with our competitors of the east and the markets of the surrounding countries in which our commodities are now exchanged in great volume; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, The interests of the great territory lying west of the banks of the Mississippi, comprising nearly 70 per cent of the area of the United States, demand that an exposition of this kind be held that our eastern neighbors and others who are wholly unaware of our capacity for producing, may become more familiar with our situation, and that general benefit may result to all; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, The city of Omaha, by reason of its hotel facilities and railroad communications, would be of easy access and would accommodate great numbers of people, and its vast army of skilled workmen, who could in a short time place in readiness grounds and buildings for such an enterprise, would be one of the most suitable locations west of the Mississippi river for a display of the kind proposed, therefore, be it</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That we, the members of the Central Labor union of Omaha, representing every organized body of skilled and unskilled working men withing the limits of this metropolis, in regular meeting assembled, in view of the commercial, industrial and agricultural interests of this great and growing west, are in favor of the trans-Mississippi exposition of 1898 being held in the city of Omaha; and be it further</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That we give every reasonable encouragement and assistance in our power to all efforts made on the part of individuals and organized bodies in the trans-Mississippi country in the furtherance of this cause, and,</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That in view of the fact that we as workingmen will be greatly benefited by so laudable an enterprise, we will do our utmost to make it a success, that credit may be reflected alike upon our sister states, the commonwealth of Nebraska and the city of Omaha, and,</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this meeting that the fraternity of workingmen of this city shall consider themselves highly favored by the adoption of resolutions in the meetings of other labor organizations throughout the central and western states, embodying the sentiments herein contained; and be it further</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to all Central Labor union bodies west of the Mississippi river for their indorsement to hold said trans-Mississippi exposition in the said city of Omaha in the year 1898.</p>
    
<p>The preamble and resolutions were presented by Delegate D. W. Reid and were adopted amid a simultaneous shout of applause. Copies of the resolutions will be sent to all central labor bodies in the trans-Mississippi country, where they will no doubt receive attention and similar resolutions will be adopted, thus giving the expressed sentiment of several millions of people in favor of the establishment of the trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha.</p>
</div2>

<pb n="27" xml:id="TMISB01-027"/>
    
<div2 type="letter">   
<p>Whereas, At the last session of the Trans-Mississippi Congress, which was held in Omaha in the month of November 1895, the following resolution was unanimously adopted by a rising vote.</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS; We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the States west of the Mississippi River, made at some central gateway, where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities or these great wealth-producing States, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi States, but to all the home-seekers of the world, therefore,</p>
    
<p>RESOLVED; That the United States Congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September an October, in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such States and Territories in Congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases, to assist in carrying out this enterprise.</p>
    
<p>Therefore, Resolved; That we the Retailers Association of Omaha, numbering nearly five hundred members, heartily and unanimously endorse the action of said Trans-Mississippi Congress, believing that the aid asked for would not only be a well justified expenditure of the National Congress, but a simple act of justice and a merited recognition of the great Trans-Mississippi section of our country.</p>
    
<p>RESOLVED; That we not only endorse by form the effect now being made to establish the Exposition mentioned, but pledge ourselves individually and as an Association, to give such our financial <sic>aid</sic> <corr>support</corr>, to the best of our ability and power, and to use all the influence we can command, individually and collectively, to make it a success.</p>
    
<p>RESOLVED; That copies of the action of this body be sent to our Senators and Representatives in Congress and to the Secretary of the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition and to the Daily Press.</p>

    <head type="main">ALL FAVOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
    
<head type="sub">Council Bluffs Business Men Pass Resolutions on the Subject.</head>
    
<head type="sub">PREFER EAST OMAHA AS A LOCATION</head>
    
<head type="sub">Inclined to Make All Contributions from Iowa with This Condition Attached&#8212;Views of Various Individuals.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The men in Council Bluffs who are most enthusiastically engaged in promoting Iowa's interest in the Transmississippi exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 are going to stick on the location of the big show at East Omaha. That has been their contention since the movement in favor of the exposition was started on the Iowa side of the river and it was made the subject of a meeting held at the court house last night and was embodied in a set of rather drastic resolutions that were adopted touching that point.</p>
    
<p>The meeting was under the auspices of the Merchants' and Manufacturers' association of Council Bluffs and was well attended Hon. George F. Wright was called to the chair and made a brief explanation of the objects of the meeting. He recounted the experience of the committee appointed to confer with the Omaha directory of the exposition. He said the committee had been unable to secure anything like a definite statement from the Omaha committee as to the probably location of the exposition or whether or not the Omaha people had any preference in the matter.</p>
    
<p>There was no longer any question, Mr. Wright explained, but that an exposition would be held and that it would be located in Omaha. HE had just returned from Washington and was thoroughly convinced that the Iowa and Nebraska delegations would be successful in getting the bill gibing governmental sanction to the enterprises passed at the present session of congress. He complimented the Iowa and Nebraska delegations in congress and said no delegations from any other states had more influence or could get more from congress.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">AS TO IOWA'S SHARE</head>
    
<p>With the exposition a certainty, the question arose what was Iowas to get out of it. He said there were more people in the western half of Iowa than there were more people in the western half of Iowa than there were in all Nebraska, and that the exposition would be a wonderful help to the state and to Council Bluffs if it were located so that his city would have easy access to it. He thought there was no question that East Omaha was the most accessible site and said he had promised the Omaha committee that <unclear/> the exposition was located in East Omaha Council Bluffs business men and citizens would guarantee a donation of $25,000 toward the expenses of the enterprise. He predicted that there would be at least 10,000,000 people visit the exposition and if the location were in East Omaha this city would derive an immense direct benefit from the exposition and could afford to contribute liberally to the creation of the enterprise.</p>
    
<p>E. H. Merriam was very emphatic in the question of location and said Iowa had only one interest in the exposition and that was to help it if it were located in East Omaha or to help kill it if it were located elsewhere/</p>
    
<p>M. F. Rohrer, V. E. Bender, Colonel Baker and W. F. Sapp added their endorsements of the East Omaha site, and Mr. Bender presented the following resolutions:</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, the corporation known as the Transmississippi International Exposition purposes to hold an exposition within or near the city of Omaha beginning in the month of June and ending in the month of November in the year 1898, and</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, the legislature of 24 states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river are asked to participate in the exposition and to contribute to its financial support by legislative and appropriation and,</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, the state of Iowa, by reason of its proximity to the city of Nebraska and for the further reason that its legislature is in session, has been among the first to be asked to contribute to the project of the exposition, and</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, by the request of the directors of the proposed exposition a committee of eleven of the citizens of Council Bluffs has been appointed to co-operate with said directors in promoting the interests of the exposition in this state, with special reference to the securing of an appropriation form this state, be it therefore</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That the Merchants and Manufacturers' association of Council Bluffs, meeting in conjunction with other citizens, heartily approve this proposed exposition, and that they render what help they can to the project, provided that any national, state or city aid shall be conditional upon an assurance to be in the form of a joint pledge on the part of the directory of the Exposition company and the East Omaha Land company and the East Omaha Land company. And be it further</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That we request our representatives at Washington and Des Moines to use their efforts to secure liberal appropriations for this project, provided that such appropriations are made subject to the foregoing condition, and to otherwise oppose any such appropriations sought.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">THOUGHT IT SEVERE</head>
    
<p>Chairman Wright said he thought the resolutions a little severe, but the meeting wanted them adopted and they went through by a unanimous vote. The secretary was instructed to send a copy of the resolutions to each member of the Iowa legislature and a copy to each member of the Iowa and Nebraska representatives in congress.</p>
    
<p>The following resolution introduced by M. F. Rohrer was unanimously adopted:</p>
    
<p>Whereas, The articles of incorporation of the Transmississippi Exposition company provide that each of the states participating shall be represented in the organization by a vice president appointed by the governor; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, It is the desire of the exposition company that the vice president from Iowa shall be a citizen of Council Bluffs; be it therefore</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That it is the unanimous wish of the citizens in mass meeting assembled that Hon. George F. Wright of this city be named as vice president, and that this wish be made known to the governor by the secretary of this meeting.</p>
    
<p>The committee of eleven heretofore appointed with A. S. Hazelton as chairman was continued in power and authorized and instructed to act in accordance with the sentiment of the meeting as expressed in the above resolutions.</p></div3>

M. Hubner, who used for a gavel the first object which came to hand and this proved to be one of the big round silver dollars which "Tim" Sedgwick had just paid to Secretary W.E.

<div3><head type="sub">WOMAN TO THE FRONT.</head>
    
<p>At the last annual meeting the Woman's auxiliary had been established as a place where the women workers might be at home. There was a good number of these present, bu they steadfastly refused to stay outside and attend any side show, but came right in and had front seats under the big tent. One of the old-timers, who has not become reconciled to the idea of the new woman, was ungracious enough to say, very privately, however, that the women were contending for "full equal rights and special privileges." The opposition of the women finally led tot he abandonment of the plan of a separate organization, and they ten came forward and registered as full members of the association. The following were the ladies present this afternoon:</p>

<div3><head type="sub">EXPOSITION INDORSE<unclear/></head>
    
<p>After the program in the afternoon was completed a business meeting was held, at which I. W. Carpenter of Omaha was introduced for the purpose of presenting a resolution indorsing the trans-Mississippi exposition. The resolution, which was adopted is as follows:</p>
    
<p>Whereas, at the last session of the trans-Mississippi congress, which was held in the month of November, 1895, the following resolution was unanimously adopted by a rising vote:</p>
    
<p>"Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, made in some central gateway where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth-producing states, would be of great value, not only to the trans-Mississippi states, but to all the home-seekers of the world; therefore,</p>
    
<p>"Resolved, That the United States congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September and October in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such states and territories in congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in carrying out this enterprise."</p>
    
<p>And, whereas, for the purpose of facilitating the work of he proposed exposition a corporation has been organized under the style of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, articles of association have been adopted, the a mount of capital stock necessary to begin business has been subscribed and the organization has elected officers and is now ready for work; and</p>
    
<p>Whereas, A bill has been introduced in the congress of the United States asking for recognition from the national government, for an appropriation for a national building and for a national exhibit; and,</p>
    
<p>Whereas, Steps are being taken in each of the states comprising the trans-Mississippi region to secure the exhibit of the resources and products of <unclear/> asking for state legislative assistance to enable them to do this; and,</p>
    
<p>Whereas, No such opportunity has ever before been offered the great west and this state to advertise its resources and products to the home-seekers of the world as this exposition will afford; therefore, be it</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That the Nebraska Press association, in convention assembled, pledges its hearty support to the indorsement of the plan of said exposition, and each member pledges his best endeavor toward bringing it to a triumphantly successful issue by putting its advantages before the people of our section through the press and by using our influence with our members in congress and the senate of the United States and urging them to procure the national assistance of the exposition, which national assistance of the great trans-Mississippi region.</p></div3>

<ab>THE EVENING NEWS, THE MORNING RECORD, Chicago Ill., Feb. 25.</ab>
    
<ab>Editor Omaha World-Herald:</ab>
    
<p>The proposition to hold an exposition of the Trans-Mississippi states at Omaha in 1898 should commend itself favorably to all the people of the great northwest. The Northwest is so vast in its area that the development of its integral parts must necessarily be greatly advanced by such a bringing together of the evidences of progress and of natural endowments as such expositions make practicable. It goes without saying that Omaha is peculiarly the proper place for holding such an exhibition.</p>
    
<ab>VICTOR F. LAWSON</ab>
    
<ab>ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH, St. Louis, Feb. 24.</ab>
    
<p>The idea of an exposition of the Trans-Mississippi states at Omaha in 1898 is one that should appeal strongly to the people of the Mississippi Valley and the great West. Such an exposition could not fail to show the unapproached fertility and the productiveness of the greatest agricultural country of the world, and would be rich in interest and suggestiveness. I do not see why it should not receive warm support from the press and people of the great West.</p>

It is to be an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, to be made at some central gateway, where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of ht great wealth-producing states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river.</p>
    
<p>In the modern exposition is presented a wonderful volume of information. Its every page is crowded with practical knowledge, and illumined by the most attractive object lessons. Such living books have been opened in different parts of this country, and whether the volume was large or small its pages have been scanned with eagerness by thousands of those anxious to know more of the lives and deeds of their fellowmen. The suggestion to prepare such showing, narrating and illustrating the resources of that wonderful section of our country embraced in the Trans-Mississippi states, has rapidly developed into a preliminary plan, giving promise of a speedy ripening into an assured success. The realization of the magnitude of the enterprise and the advantages to arise form it, have not yet taken hold of the public mind. When these are in even measurable degree comprehended the enthusiasm of support will be only equaled by its unanimity. It is intended that the twenty-four states lying west of the Mississippi river shall be the chief participants in the presentation of this exposition, and that such presentation will be so extensive and meritorious as to draw to it visitors from every part of the world. These states have developed so wonderfully and rapidly as to give a seeming realization of the fanciful tales of Aladdin's lamp. The very people who are living where they daily see the marvelous results  of this magic growth do not themselves realize how civilization has smiled upon the great American desert and caused it to blossom as the rose. The Trans-Mississippi country is an area larger than most of the leading nations of the globe. In resources it is more varied and richer than any, and these resources have but just been touched by development, and yet it has the material to form a display which would cause the whole world to open its eyes with a wonderment like that of the babe when first greeted by the brilliancy of the sun. The exposition will be a revelation to the people of the very section whose wealth of resource and wonder of development make it possible. They will be surprised by their own achievements and inspired by their own possibilities. The whole west will feel the throbbings of new life and ambition.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">WHY IT SHOULD BE HELD.</head>
    
<p>In the sections east of the Mississippi there is an even greater ignorance of what he west is and what it may be. There is with this ignorance the natural tinge of prejudice. These two conditions make it difficult to induce the desired influx of capital and immigration, and with the passing away of the ignorance there will necessarily disappear all prejudice and feeling and timidity of investment. Just in proportion as the east realizes the actual present and probable future of the west, will there be an inflowing of those helps so necessary for the further and speedy development of these resources. The proposed exposition is one of the readiest and most satisfactory means of disseminating this needed information, east and west. The printed page is dull beside the living book. The world is not satisfied with being told. It wants to see.</p>
    
<p>IT is most befitting, therefore, that the national government should contribute to an enterprise of such national benefit. It has given its aid to other expositions of more restricted boundaries, and more local in their nature. Surely no only consistency warrants like aid for the Trans-Mississippi exposition, bu it should be the more liberal, as the plan is the broader and the section represented larger. IT is not only proposed but purposed to make this exposition second only to the world's fair. Nothing short of this will meet the expectations of the originators, nor fairly represent the possibilities of the great west. The $250,000 asked of congress is a bagatelle compared with the sum which the people will put into this enterprise, and a <unclear/>erely nominal price for the benefits which the nation at large will receive in return.</p></div3>

<div3><head type="sub">AIDS TO THE PROJECT.</head>
    
<p>There is little need of enlarging on the general benefits to be gained. It <unclear/> natural and right that local advan<unclear/> should also be considered, for on the shoulders of the people of Iowa and Nebraska largely rests the burden of preparation and performance. It is only fair that these two states should share equally in the benefits, as they do in the labor. They will not be found shirking their duty, or allowing any just drafts on purse or power to go to protest. Iowa is the first state to give official recognition and endorsement to the project, and under certain conditions there will be no hesitancy in Iowa making such appropriations as are necessary, and giving  such moral and substantial aid as is needed to win the success to which all are looking forward with such confidence. Nebraska will naturally strive for first place both in effort and enterprise, and the friendly rivalry of the two states, should the exposition be properly located, will cause its inspiring effect to throb to the outmost extremity of the far-reaching territory thus represented.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">WHERE SHOULD THE SITE BE?</head>
    
<p>Naturally, too, the interest deepens as it centers on the twin cities, which come in closest and most continuous touch with the actuality of the exposition itself. Council Bluffs and Omaha should be alike interested. While Omaha has the marked advantage of the prestige arising form having its name linked with the location of the exposition, the Council Bluffs has no disposition to show petty envy or childish pouting. At the same time Council Bluffs justly feels that it's aid is essential to the success of the enterprise, and hence its local interests and wishes should not be ignored. Such interests and wishes will influence largely not merely the action of the city and the closely adjacent territory, but will govern to a great extent the action of the state legislature and tend strongly to determine the attitude which Iowa's influential representation in congress will assume in regard to national aid. Council Bluffs is recognized as the western gateway to Iowa, and as it is proposed to locate this exposition at this entrance, the keepers of the gate should naturally be inquired of as to what the outlook is. Will there come trooping through this gateway into Iowa, its equitable share of the benefit, in the securing of which Iowa is asked to give generous aid? Any attempt to thwart the incoming of these benefits, or to use the gateway as simply an outgo from Iowa, with not corresponding income, will cause Iowa's state and national representatives to cool in ardor, and to refuse aid to any enterprise failing to show proper recognition of the interests and privileges of this city and state. Nor is there any just motive to actuate any such disposition on the part of Omaha, for were that city to attempt such a course, the benefits of which Council Bluffs would be deprived, would not accrue to Omaha, but would not accrue to Omaha, but would be jeopardized. Omaha's voice has given and implied promise that the interests of Council Bluffs and Iowa will be as jealously guarded of those of Omaha and Nebraska, but in the very <unclear reason="torn"/>ency of the planning there should <unclear reason="torn"/>not only an inference but an <unclear reason="torn"/>ance. Hope should not be based <unclear reason="torn"/> whisper, but on avowal.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">EAST OMAHA, THE PLACE.</head>
    
<p>One of the most important pre<unclear reason="torn"/>naries to be determined is the loca<unclear reason="torn"/> of the grounds, and in this Council Bluffs has a deep interest, for upon <unclear reason="torn"/> depends largely the question as to wh<unclear reason="torn"/> benefits will locally arise. It is <unclear reason="torn"/> enough that the exposition should <unclear reason="torn"/> held somewhere in Omaha. Omaha <unclear reason="torn"/> a city of area and this elasticity of indefinite location might be stretched to embrace grounds so far to the west, or north, or south of the city, as to practically put the exposition as truly away from Council Bluffs as though it were located at Lincoln. For instance, one has but to recall the trying experiences of an attempt to get form Council Bluffs as though it were located at Lincoln. For instance, one has but to recall the trying experiences of an attempt to get form Council Bluffs to the state fair, located in the western part of Omaha, to realize that an exposition thus located might better be in Papillion, so far as this city is concerned. It could get neither pleasure or benefit should the exposition be located in such an out-of-the-way place. Omaha people themselves found it hardly less disadvantageous and inconvenient, but local reasons seemed to make that location advisable for that purpose. Such local reasons do not exist in regard to the exposition, for the exposition has not the elements of permanency, or is it intended for the accommodation of the people of one city or of one state. It is not only advisable, but absolutely necessary that a far different sort of a location should be selected for this enterprise, to secure local support or general success.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">SELFISH MOTIVES MUST BE PUT ASIDE.</head>
    
<p>It is to be regretted that under the surface assurances of a fair consideration of the interests of Council Bluffs, there is a strong leaning among the Omaha leaders in the exposition project to locate it in some outlying suburban district which will practically take it out of the reach of this city and deprive this city of its just benefits. The masses in Omaha would protest against any such outlying location, not simply because it would be unfair to Council Bluffs, but because it would be inconvenient to themselves and a jeopardy to the success of the exposition.</p>
    
<p>It is believed that the citizens of Omaha and Nebraska will heartily endorse the proposal to locate the exposition in East Omaha, when they fairly understand the situation. It is believed that the citizens of Council Bluffs and of Iowa will, when likewise enlightened, not only endorse the selection of East Omaha, but will good-naturedly but firmly demand it as a condition to their giving the project the support and aid asked for. It is for the pur-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
    
<p><unclear reason="torn"/></p>
    
    <anchor/> <!-- <pb n="40" xml:id="TMISB01-040"/> -->
    
<p>convenience to visitors, either from the cities or from a distance, and it is in the offering of such conveniences of ingress and egress that the success of the project largely lies. It was the great problem of the World fair, and more stress was laid upon it by the projectors of that mammoth enterprise than upon any other single feature. While East Omaha presents great advantages to both cities, the advantages offered to those coming form a distance are very important. In East Omaha the problem solves itself.</p>

<p>These visitors, too, while here want to see both cities, and both cities want to be seen. Council Bluffs has a special interest in thus sharing with Omaha. The larger city naturally receives the most attention, but if the exposition is located far from Council Bluffs, all the visitors will see Omaha, and a few only will take a look at Council Bluffs. What this city wants, and what it has the right to demand, is that while all will want to look over Omaha, Council Bluffs should not be overlooked. It will not hurt Omaha, and it will help Council Bluffs.</p></div3>

<div3><head type="sub">WILL MEET THEM HALF WAY.</head>
    
<p>To furnish the needed conveniences for this easy reaching of the grounds and for visiting both cities the railways would not need to lay a foot of track. The terminal company would have to put in a little, but it will gladly do that, as well as make liberal arrangements in regard to traffic and the use of bridge and tracks. The terminal company and the East Omaha Land company are alike interested in making the exposition a grand success, and while they are naturally actuated by more or less consideration of their own interests, still these considerations are rather for future profit than for present greed. They generously offer the use of ht grounds free, proffer other advantages for practically nothing, so that he exposition can have its location there without any expenditure worth the mentioning. This is not necessarily due to the philanthropy of the companies interested in East Omaha, as much as to a combination of public spiritedness and self-interest. They can well afford to be generous, as East Omaha would be advertised and presented to the world under the most favorable conditions, and in the future, after the exposition had passed into history, they will doubtless reap their reward if they faint not. The public is now looking after the interests of the exposition, and not of East Omaha, and if the generosity of the companies in control willingly places these advantages at the disposal of the public, there should be no hesitancy in accepting the proffer.</p></div3>

<div3><head type="sub">WATER ADVANTAGES.</head>
    
<p>Another important feature of the East Omaha location is the advantage of water. Those who got filled with dust in trying to reach the state fair, and who after reaching it still found nothing but more dust and no water with which to even mix it, will readily appreciate the suggestion that East Omaha has a bountiful water supply. The city waterworks are extended already to the grounds and there is no need of heavy expenditures to secure all that is needed for drinking purposes. Then there is the lake, affording a charming opportunity for picturesque landscaping and boating pleasure. If there is and threatened lowering of the water the laying of a pipe to the north, tapping Florence lake and thus securing an unlimited supply from the Missouri river is a cheap and practical remedy. The lay of the grounds at the east of the lake is such as to be easily transformed into lagoons and a court so that with comparatively little expense there may be provided a miniature and beautiful reproduction of the World's fair, with Cut-Off lake to serve as a substitute for Lake Michigan, making the picture complete. Courtland beach would be improved and beautified by its owners, without doubt, adding to the attractiveness of the scene. Nor would this miniature reproduction of the water scenes of the World's fair b on a very diminutive scale. The launches and boats besides the trips about the lagoons could have a mile or so to stretch away on the lake. These possibilities are withing easy reach, too, of the probabilities of the financial resources of the project. Nowhere else withing easy reach of these two cities would such advantages be secured with so little outlay. Nature by the freaks of its great river has left the needed lake, and the ravines ready for the inpouring of the water, and all that is needed is a touch of the artist's hand to clothe them with beauty.</p></div3>

<div3><head type="sub">SITE EQUI-DISTANT FROM BOTH CITIES.</head>
    
<p>Another advantage of the East Omaha location does not appear on the above map, but it becomes very apparent from a glance at the published maps of the two cities. It is fully a mile nearer to the Omaha postoffice than the fair grounds are, so that it is nearer and more convenient for the majority of the people in Omaha. To Council Bluffs people it offers still greater advantages. The distance from the Council Bluffs postoffice to the fair grounds is about seven miles on a bee line, and more than eight miles by the usual travel. The East Omaha location is a little over three miles form the postoffice in Council Bluffs, so that while Omaha would gain a mile or more by having East Omaha chosen instead of the state fair grounds, Council Bluffs would save about five miles of travel.</p>

<p>Still another important consideration is the roominess of grounds. It is necessary to have plenty of opportunity not only for the placing of the buildings and the arranging of the display but there should be opportunity given for so arranging them as to provide for the attractiveness and convenience of the exposition. This cannot be accomplished if there is any crowding. Any proposition to temporarily enlarge the limited area of he state fair grounds by the use of public parks or private property would involve, as it has before, controversial questions of legality and willingness. In East Omaha no such vexatious questions can arise. The land is under a single control, or practically so, and there will be no difficulty in securing a free and absolute control of an almost unlimited area. Anywhere from 120 to 500 acres of land are placed at the disposal of the exposition enterprise, and thus this problem, which so vexed the managers of the world's fair, is disposed of in the very initiative of the movement.</p></div3>

<div3><head type="sub">DIRECT BENEFITS.</head>
    
<p>Now as to the more direct benefits that would flow form this great exposition. Months before the formal opening, both Omaha and Council Bluffs will be active with preparations for the show. The work is necessary in getting the grounds ready and the buildings erected, will give employment to labor and the demand for material of all kinds will bring business to the dealers. Transportation facilities must be provided, hotel and lodging houses will be opened. It is altogether probable that another hotel would be built in Council Bluffs. The exposition will remain open for a period of five months. At a very low estimate, the attendance will average 15,000 people per day. At the Atlanta exposition the crowds frequently exceeded 75,000, and the Trans-Mississippi Exposition will be on a much grander scale than was the one at Atlanta. It is reasonable to think that each of the 15,000 people will spend $2.00 per day in the two cities, making a daily expenditure of $30,000, and a total for five months amounting to several millions of dollars.</p></div3>

<div3><head type="sub">WHAT SHOULD BE DONE</head>
    
<p>On the whole, the exposition project offers to the people of Council Bluffs and Omaha an opportunity for gain and prestige, far beyond anything that has ever been suggested, and it is worth a prodigious effort on the part of the citizens of Council Bluffs to secure the location at East Omaha. To this end the Iowa delegation at Washington should be importuned to withhold their sanction and support of the measure now before congress asking for a government appropriation of $250,000, until the matter of the exposition site is definitely determined. The board of directors of the exposition site is definitely determined. The board of directors of the exposition claim that hey have no legal right to decide where the site is to be. If that is the case, the matter of a government appropriation may will be deferred until the next session of congress, or at least until the directory is so organized that it can fully and finally determine where the site shall be. The sentiment in Iowa is strongly in favor of a location mid-way between the two cities, and any appropriation which the state may make in aid of the exposition should be made wholly on condition that such a site will be chosen.</p></div3>

<head type="main">THE EXPOSITION BRIDGE.</head>
    
<p>The Omaha press has wisely concluded that it cannot longer ignore the just demand that the location of the Trans-Mississippi exposition should be among the first things to be decided upon in order to win success. The expressed wishes of Council Bluffs were at first treated with silence which has a tinge of contempt strangely inconsistent with the appeal for this city to give its aid to the project, and to use its influence in gaining the support of Iowa's state and national representatives. The growing sentiment in Omaha that the East Omaha location is the most feasible and desirable for all except the few who have some conflicting local interests of their own has helped, too, in causing the press of that city to at least break the suspicious silence. The utterances, however, have thus far been of a very cautious nature, and have been characterized for the most part by an apparent desire to quiet Council Bluffs with a lullaby.</p>
    
<lg><l>"Sleep little Bluffs, sleep,</l>
<l>While Omaha watches the sheep."</l></lg>
    
<p>The Bee says: "The board of managers of the Trans-Mississippi exposition have very wisely decided not to cross the location bridge until it gets to it."</p>
    
<p>This is rather in variance with previous sedative expressions that the board of  managers had no power to decide the question of location. Now that it is admitted that hey have the authority, and that they have exercised it by deciding not to cross the bridge until they get to it, it is fair to infer that they will cross said bridge when they do get to it. The fact is they have got to it new, and it is known as the East Omaha bridge. Will they cross it? Come, be honest and play fair.</p>
    
<p>The Omaha Excelsior has set a more manly example and has given space to a reproduction of The Nonpareil map showing the advantages of the East Omaha site and has evinced a willingness to have the matter discussed openly and fairly. It closes an editorial with: "The Trans-Mississippi commission do not believe that they have the right to establish the location. If they haven't, who has? We cannot wait on congress."</p>
    
<p>The Omaha papers should get together and agree a to whether the managers have the right to decide a location or not. If they have no such right then they ought to first get a management which has the right. If they have the right then they should first exercise it and decide on a lot before they ask folks to give them money to help build the house.</p>

<p>An Omaha paper shouts "Utilize the East Omaha Bridge." If it really means it why not start right in and prepare to utilize it by making East Omaha the site of the exposition.</p>

<p>The press of the city over the river is shouting "Stand Up For Omaha." If it stands up high enough to get a fair view of the situation it will see that East Omaha is just the site for the exposition.</p></div2>

    <div2 type="article">
<p>Omaha through its press and by private correspondence is urging that Council Bluffs keep still about the question of locating the exposition. Council Bluffs keep still about eh question of locating the exposition. Council Bluffs has in times past listened to lullabies only to wake up and find that some great opportunity had slipped by during its lull. Experience ought to have taught it to get in its work first and take its lullaby afterwards. When the agitation of the location first started the managers of the exposition project declared they had no authority to decide upon a location. Now they admit that hey have the authority, but don't want to exercise it yet. They ought to first find out where they are at, and where the location is to be "at" and then let the orchestra start up. All will join in, quick time, and lots of harmony.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 type="article">
<p>Gov. Drake's appointment of Hon. George F. Wright, of this city, as the vice president for Iowa of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, is in full accord with the wishes of Council Bluffs, and will meet with the hearty approval of all interested in the success of the great enterprise. The Omaha press express their satisfaction of the appointment, and pay graceful compliments to Mr. Wright's worthiness. It is to be hoped that this era of good feeling for him, and to respect for his ability and wisdom of judgment will manifest itself also when the occasion arises for him to show his well-known loyalty to Council Bluffs and Iowa by insisting on having the exposition located where it can be of some advantage to the city and state which he represents.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 type="article">
<p>An Omaha paper says it is useless to talk just now about locating the Trans-Mississippi exposition, for there is nothing to locate. If that is so why ask for any appropriations if there is nothing to receive the appropriation? If there is nothing to locate, the board of managers had better hustle around and get something. council Bluffs has found a good place to put it, and the sooner something is got the better. The quickest way to get it is to frankly tell where it is to be put.</p>

<p>The prediction is made that the Paris exposition of 1900 will be a whopper because twenty-four different governments have signified their intentions to participate. Come to think of it that's just the number of states which will participate in the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held in East Omaha in 1898, and there isn't one of these twenty-four states but what is bigger and better than the ordinary nation. If the Paris exposition is to be a whopper the Trans-Mississippi one will be a whopper.</p>

<head type="sub">DEMAND EAST OMAHA.</head>

<head type="sub">Merchants and Manufacturers Radical on the Exposition Location.</head>

<p>In the superior court room in the country court house last evening a meeting of the Merchants and Manufacturers' association with other citizens of Council Bluffs was held for the purpose of an expression regarding the site which ought to be chosen for the Trans-Mississippi exposition. Considerable feeling has been stirred up in this city over the question, but the extremists who are responsible for the most radical utterances seem to be limited in number. Many of the things said last evening in the heat of oratorical effort were deprecated by the cooler headed of those present after the meeting was over. That the action to be taken was to a certain extent cut and dried was evident from the fact that a representative of a local sheet appeared with "proofs" of a large part of the resolutions which were to b presented and which were passed, the matter having already been put in type before its presentation before the meeting.</p>

<p>The gathering was addressed by George F. Wright first. He gave a brief history of the efforts which representatives of this city have made to secure a definite location of the exposition ground in East Omaha and made a statement of the present status of the matter. He was followed by E. H. Merriam, who declared that if the exposition was not located in East Omaha on the site selected by the local republican oracle he thought Council Bluffs out to work against the exposition in all possible ways. M. F. Rohrer, Victor Bender and Colonel W. F. Baker followed in speeches similar in tenor, but more mild in expression, and the following resolutions were passed:</p>

<p>Whereas, The articles of incorporation of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition company provide that each of the states participating shall be represented in the organization by a vice president appointed by the governor, and</p>

<p>Whereas, It is the desire of the exposition company that he vice president from Iowa shall be a citizen of Council Bluffs, be it therefore</p>

<p>Resolved, That it is the unanimous wish of the citizens in mass meeting assembled that Hon. George F. Wright of this city be named as vice president, and that this wish be made known to the governor by the secretary of this meeting.</p>

<p>Whereas, The corporation known as the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition purposes to hold an exposition within or near the city of Omaha, beginning in the month of June and ending in the month of November, 1898, and</p>

<p>Whereas, The legislatures of twenty-four states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river are asked to participate in the exposition and to contribute to its financial support by legislative appropriations, and</p>

<p>Whereas, The state of Iowa, by reason of its proximity to the state of Nebraska, and for the further reason that its legislature is now in session, has been among the first to be asked to contribute to the project of the exposition, and</p>

<p>Whereas, By the request of the directors of the proposed exposition, a committee of eleven of the citizens of Council Bluffs has been appointed to co-operate with said directors in promoting the interests of the exposition, with special reference to the securing of an appropriation from the state; be it therefore</p>

<p>Resolved, That the Merchants and Manufacturers association of Council Bluffs, meeting in conjunction with other citizens, heartily approve this proposed exposition, and that hey render what help they can to the national or city aid shall be conditioned upon an assurance that he exposition shall be located on a site within the boundaries of what is known as East Omaha, such assurance to be in the form of a joint pledge on the part of the directory of the exposition company and the East Omaha Land company; and be it further</p>

<p>Resolved, That we request our representatives at Washington and Des Moines to use their efforts to secure liberal appropriations for this project, provided that such appropriations are made subject to the foregoing condition, and to otherwise oppose any such appropriations sought.</p>

<p>WHEREAS, The Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress at its Eighth Annual session in November last, adopted unanimously by a rising vote, the following:</p>
    
<p>"WHEREAS, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the States west of the Mississippi River, made at some central gateway where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth-producing states, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi states, but to all the home-seekers of the world; therefore,</p>
    
<p>RESOLVED, That the United States Congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha, during the months of August, September and October, in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such states and territories in Congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in carrying out this enterprise."</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, For the purpose of facilitating the work of the proposed exposition, a corporation has been organized under the style of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, whose purpose is to so conduct and arrange the affairs and proceedings in connection with and relating to the proposed exposition in order that the broadest and most beneficial results may be obtained; and,</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, To secure the largest success to the enterprise, entire harmony of feeling and effort should exist, to the entire exclusion of personal and corporate interests; and,</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, It is deemed unwise and impracticable to endeavor to hold said exposition without the recognition of Congress, and National encouragement through appropriations providing for National Buildings and National Exhibits; and,</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS, An attempt is now being made to force upon this organization the matter of the location of said exposition, and coerce it into deciding upon a certain site, and threatening to kill the enterprise if said desired location is not now agreed upon; therefore be it</p>

<ab>Editor Omaha World-Herald.</ab>
    
<p>I can conceive of no step the Trans-Mississippi states could take that would inure the more greatly or quickly to their benefit then the proposed exposition at Omaha in 1898. There have been expositions and movements for the exclusive benefit of almost every section of our country, but no concerted or organized movement for that portion of our country which would be advanced by this exposition.</p>
    
<p>The states which would contribute to the success of such an exposition are those which contribute most to the feeding and clothing, the necessities, of not only the people of this entire country, but those portions of the old world depending upon the United States for the necessaries of life. What an interest everywhere such an exposition should excite! It would enlist all of the great corn, wheat and cotton states all of that great country that gives to the world the leading articles of food. What an exhibition from the cattle ranges, too!</p>
    
<p>There are of course many obstacles in the way of any great exhibition of products; but the Trans-Mississippi country has in the past overcome more of them, without federal or outside assistance, than any other portion of our country. She wrought out her own development, attracted her own population, educated it and gave it wealth. Her factories and mills were established by her own people, while those of New England were principally a foreign inheritance. There could be introduced novelties, from mother earth, nowhere ever witnessed before in exposition.</p>
    
<p>Much interest is now taken in the proposition in the Ohio Valley and the South, and there is no doubt that much would be contributed in these sections to its success.</p>
    
<p>I commend the proposition to immense success.</p>

<ab>Editor of the World-Herald:</ab>
    
<p>It seems to me that the proposition to hold an exposition of the Trans-Mississippi states at Omaha in 1898 is a most excellent one. Such a fair would be a most valuable educator of the people, especially those living in the East, who have no fair conception of the vast and varied resources of the Middle West and Sunset States, Unreasonable as it may seem to the main of travel and broad experience, the opinion prevails in the East that the West produces more real estate boomers and outlaws than anything else. The relations of the two sections have, become closer as their interests have become more common and they will be materially strengthened by any enterprise that faithfully expresses and reveals the importance of the agricultural, mineral and lumber districts of the West.</p>

<p>In my opinion no more favorable point could have been selected for the proposed exposition than Omaha, because of its central location and the ease with which it may be reached form all the populous sections of the North, East, South and West. The scheme, if carried forward, will undoubtedly be successful and the results must be of great benefit to the whole country. I have for it good and sincere wishes.</p>

<ab>Carson, Nev., Feb. 26.</ab>
    
<p>Editor of the World-Herald: Omaha, above all other cities of the West, is an ideal place for an Exposition of the Trans-Mississippi States in 1898.</p>
    
<p>The West, with its rapidly advancing development, needs something to cement the friendship of the various States and consolidate their varied interests. Such an exposition, conducted as it could be in Omaha, would awaken a good deal of latent Western Pride and show the States more directly interested how big and broad and enterprising it really was. Nevada will be proud to co-operate with Nebraska at such a time.</p>

<p>Editor of the World-Herald: Your favor is received asking my opinion of the proposition to hold an Exposition of the Trans-Mississippi States at Omaha in 1898.</p>
    
<p>I cannot but think very favorably of it. No better or more convenient point could be selected for such an Exposition. Omaha is closely allied to the mining States of the West, to the grazing States of the South and to the great grain diversified trade, embracing grain, cattle, smelting and manufacturing. All of the varied industries of the Trans-Mississippi States are represented in that city.</p>
    
<p>It is, too, accessible from every quarter, having immense railroad facilities.</p>
    
<p>For these reasons such an Exposition could not be otherwise than successful, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The proposition to hold an exposition of the Trans-Mississippi States at Omaha in 1898 occurs to me as being an excellent suggestion. Such an Exposition would establish to the world that the great country west of the Mississippi is not the smallest portion of the United States, either in the personnel of its population, its resources or the other qualities which go toward making the great Republic the powerful nation that it is. I think you may feel confident that California will be found joining with enthusiasm in the proposed enterprise. Hoping the scheme may meet with general favor and become an established fact, I am very truly yours,</p>

<head type="sub">GOVERNOR WELLS' WISE WORDS</head>
    
<p>Salt Lake City, UTAH, March 2.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: In response to your invitation, I have pleasure in saying, in reference to the proposition to hold at Omaha, in 1898, an exposition of the products, resources, manufactures, arts and industries of the Transmississippi states, that the same has my unequivocal indorsement. For many years I have been a thorough convert to the efficacy of fair-holding as a means of promoting the industrial advancement of a community, a commonwealth, or a nation. The states in question, although the youngest in years, certainly have the resources to make them the greatest wealth producers of any portion of the United States.</p>
    
<p>A fitting and accurate display of these resources will be extremely beneficial to the states in question for very many reasons, chief among which is that their greatness of the eastern states, and the exposition, if properly patronized, would not only challenge this recognition but would also be the means of procuring capital to a much greater extent than hitherto, for the development of the resources of this great region. So far as Utah is concerned, the question of holding a semi-centennial inter-mountain exposition at Salt Lake City in 1897, commemorative of the advent of the Mormon pioneers in 1847, is begin agitated by the state legislature now in session. If this is decided upon, of course, it would detract from the support which Utah might otherwise give the Omaha exposition. It is possible, too, that considering the extra burdens to be borne by our recent admission to statehood, and the fact that our public finances are not in the favorable condition that we would wish, the state legislature may decide to entertain neither of the propositions for economical reasons, I am advised of yet another contemplated exposition, to be held at Dallas, Tex., in 18997, in celebration of the semi-centennial existence of Texas, and acquisition by the United States of all those sister states and territories added to the American union by the treaty of Guadulupe Hidalgo. It would seem to me, if there could be a concentration of energy by the western states, that it would be productive of better results, and one affair could be given that would be immensely creditable, while a diffusion of strength, like scattered shot, might prove inefficient and impotent. I have the honor to be, very truly yours,</p>
    
<ab>HEBER M. WELLS, Governor of Utah.</ab>
    
<p>Governor Wells' frank letter deserves the serious and prompt consideration of the promoters of the proposed exposition. He expresses his own great interest in the proposition, by he points out the serious danger that the great success of the exposition at Omaha may be threatened by a variety of other propositions.</p>
    
<p>As Governor Wells says: "Concentration of energy by the western states would be productive of better results, and one affair could be given that would be immensely creditable, while a diffusion of strength, like scattered shot, might prove inefficient and impotent."</p>
    
<p>The attention of the promoters of the proposed exposition must now be devoted to the transmississippi states. The concentration suggested by Governor Wells must be effected, and that as speedily as possible.</p>
    
<p>The citizens of Omaha must take a deep interest in this project and place their best energy and their means behind the proposition.</p>

<head type="sub">One Enthusiastic Omaha Man Suggests a Press Bureau.</head>
    
<p>"The Trans-Mississippi exposition is getting up steam rather slowly, I'll admit," said a gentleman the other day, "but nevertheless surely. It needs a little more life and a little more money. Our senators and congressmen are doing nobly, but they need more public sentiment form the twenty-four great states directly interested. The press of these states has not yet been aroused. The committee in charge of this enterprise should take steps to interest the press of the country. The newspapers of all this central west can be immediately enlisted on our side by a very little judicious direct effort by some newspaper man with time and ability. It would pay the exposition committee to create a press bureau and provide it with the means for immediate usefulness. Another thing out to be done, and for $10,000 or less money can be done. The governors of the several states should be invited to send commissioners to an exposition meeting to be held in Omaha, early in May. The vice presidents should be included. The exposition committee, as soon as it is advised of the appointments, should send the commissioners tickets to Omaha and return and advise them their expenses for the trip would all be met by the citizens of this city. When they come, a grand banquet should be tendered to them; the plans of the exposition board should be created. Every man would thus become a local advocate of the enterprise, with an official connection which would enable him and associates to be selected while the commissioners are here, if possible, to organize local boards in all the states to be included. The way to get the exposition, and to make it an unqualified success, is to go after it in generous western style. You can never arouse enthusiasm enough to kindle a general interest by sitting in a little back room dictating letters to stenographers and printing circulars for the mails. A personal effort and a friendly press in every state are the essentials, a long, long time before the surveyors stake out any boundaries for the buildings."</p></div2>

<p>Replying to your recent favor will say that no state in the great western empire beyond the Mississippi will hail with greater delight the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition than Wyoming. So far as I have heard expressions everybody favors holding the proposed exposition. It would be an opportunity never before accorded western energy, not excepting the great Columbian exposition. The great development that Wyoming has made in agriculture, not to speak of the wonderful riches of her mines, which are just now becoming known, would be sufficient incentive for your people to furnish ocular testimony of our greatness. No state is better prepared to begin the work than Wyoming. Every city in the state, scattered as they may be, has boards of trade or mining exchanges. Every country in the state also has an immigration board. All these organizations could be united in the work for the state and the exposition.</p>

<p>It is my belief that the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 will prove to be the most popular and the most successful of anything of the kind ever seen in this country, always excepting the peerless World's fair at Chicago. As an exposition of the development of the western portion of the United States it will excel even our World's fair.</p>
    
<p>The western states that will be fully represented in this exposition have not done justice to themselves at any of the others on account of their location and the great expense of transportation. An exhibition of the development and improvement of the United States cannot be properly made if the western states are not fully represented.</p>
    
<p>The great development of this country during the last quarter of a century has been made west of the Mississippi river. The people have seen something of this in other expositions, they have read much of it and in a general way know that we have been doing pretty well. The country contiguous and tributary to a certain trade center will naturally be best represented in a fair or exposition held at that place.</p>
    
<p>Let us have an exposition at Omaha, with government aid, and all the usual concomitants, and we will show the world that the booms of the western country have a solid foundation to support them and that "westward the star of the empire takes its course."</p>
    
<p>Nebraska can rely on Wyoming for all the aid within her power to make the exposition entirely successful.</p>

or no enterprise which would result in greater good, not only to Omaha and the country contiguous&#8212;not only to the great west, bu to the entire country. This exposition, the success of which is in a large measure now assured, will serve to a better acquaint the people with the vast and varied resources and unequaled productiveness of the trans-Mississippi country. Such an exposition will not only disclose the marvelous development during the last fifty years of this empire of over 2,000,000 square miles of territory, with a present population of 20,000,000 people, but it will develop the fact that its future possibilities are almost without limit and that its resources may be made capable of sustaining in comfort many millions more.</p>
    
<p>Our sister states of the east will come and get better acquainted with the wealth of resources of the great two thirds of our nation, lying west of the Mississippi river and containing less than one-third of the country's population. The business interests of the great centers of commerce in the eastern and central states will meet at Omaha the different agencies which made these cities possible.</p>
    
<p>The <unclear reason="torn"/> Nebraska by reason of bringing so many thousands of people into the state at a season of the year when the fields will show the wealth of her soil and the energy of her people cannot be overestimated. The reputation acquired by the public-spirited citizens of Omaha for successfully managing all enterprises undertaken by them was doubtless one of the principal considerations, together with its admirable location, entering into the choice of Nebraska's metropolis as the place of holding this important exposition of the west. Every Nebraskan appreciates the honor and stands ready to lend a helping hand to make this exposition second only to the World's fair at Chicago and equaling it in the display of the wealth and products of the richest stretch of the country on earth. Yours very truly,</p>

<ab>Editor of the World-Herald</ab>
    
<p>I have been requested to give my opinion upon the propriety of holding an exposition for the trans-Mississippi states at Omaha in 1898. It would seem that there can be but one opinion upon such a question. Every such exposition within the history of the world has been of inestimable benefit to the country, people and industries concerned therein. Every such event has always been followed by an era of invention and improvement in the means of production and exchange, as well as in the arts and sciences.</p>
    
<p>Had I time and space I believe I could show how every community within the trans-Mississippi states would be benefited by such an exposition, but I propose to speak particularly of this wonderful show how we would be benefited by the Omaha exposition.</p>
    
<p>Truly did Marvin Hughitt declare the Black Hills to be "the richest hundred miles square on the face of the earth." Almost every natural resource within the knowledge of man is found here in abundance. An impression seems to obtain throughout the country that gold is our only resource. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Almost every metal known to chemistry is found here. Gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and iron, as well as mica, asbestos and the finest sandstone and marble, are some of the resources of this region. All the agricultural productions of the temperate zone flourish and are produced and grow luxuriantly in our rich soil.</p>
    
<p>True, gold is our great resource, and so intent have our people been in mining this metal that other industries have fallen into the background. The annual output of gold has already attained $10,000,000 and this can easily be doubled withing two years if we can induce capital to develop our mines and build reduction works. The Bald mountain region doubtless contains the greatest mass of gold ore on the face of the earth. This ore actually comes out at the grass roots. As yet no deep mining has been done in that region, but the ore is taken out from tunnels and drifts. Notwithstanding that region has been only scratched, the quantity of ore in sight is practically inexhaustible. It consists of what is known as refractory ore, which must be treated either chemically or smelted. Both these processes are now in successful operation here. The Deadwood &amp; Delaware Smelting company has a gigantic plant, treating 200 tons per day, and it is preparing to double its capacity. The Golden Reward chlorination works has about the same capacity as the smelter, and the great Kildonan mill, all running day and night, and can reduce but a small portion of the ore mined. Tens of thousands of tons of rich ore are lying upon the dump, awaiting reduction. In no country upon the face of the earth is there such inducements to capital as those now offered in reduction words at Deadwood.</p>
    
<p>These are the facts and figures which Black Hills people wish to get before the world, and in no way can they do it so successfully as at a great exposition like that to held at Omaha. I undertake to guarantee that the mining interests of the Black Hills will build at Omaha a thing which was never seen before, namely, "a gold palace." I don't mean a palace built of gold, but a great building in which every feature of this mighty gold-producing country will be exhibited. There we can exhibit ore form the Holy Terror, assaying $25,000 per ton, as well as ore picked up from the grade of the Elkhorn road in Bald mountain, assaying $80 per ton. We can probably induce the Homestake company to place on exhibition one of its bold bricks, of which they produce six every fifteen days, averaging in value $165,0000. There we can exhibit ores from a thousand mines, every one of which will yield large returns to capital. There we can exhibit coal form Hay creek, almost equal to the anthracite of Pennsylvania. There we can exhibit our fine building stone and marble, as well as our No. 1 hard wheat, weighing sixty-five pounds to the bushel.</p>
    
<p>Mr. Editor, these are some of the reasons why the people of the Black Hills will welcome a Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha. To elaborate these would be to impose upon your good nature, but our people can elaborate them at their leisure. I know our people are looking forward to this great fair with much hope and anticipation. We must have capital to develop this country, and we can make the necessary showing at that fair to obtain it. We do not ask capital to take any chances. All we ask is an investigation, knowing that no other field in the world offers such inducements.</p>

John Doniphan One of the Vice Presidents.</head>
    
<p>Col. John Doniphan of this city, was recently appointed by Gov. Stone, vice president for the state of Missouri, of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, to be held in the city of Omaha, beginning in June, and ending in November, 1898.</p>
    
<p>This project had its origin in the Trans-Mississippi congress held in Omaha last summer. The plan is now assuming definite shape. It will be under the control of a board of directors residing in Omaha. It is a stock company, incorporated under the laws of Nebraska. The capital stock is fixed at <unclear reason="torn"/>00,000, enough of which has been sub-<unclear reason="torn"/> to begin operations.</p>
    
<p>The president and secretary, designated in the articles of incorporation, are to be residents of Omaha. Each state and territory west of the Mississippi river will be officially represented by a vice-president appointed by the governor. There are twenty-four in all. It is called the Trans-Mississippi and International Exhibition, because it will be under the control of the states west of the Mississippi, although it is to be national and international in the scope of its exhibits.</p>
    
<p>The immediate object of the enterprise will be an exhibition of the great staples of the trans-Mississippi region, together with exhibits of the arts, industries, manufactures, illustrative of the progress, development and natural resources of that and other sections of this country as well as from Mexico, the Central and South American governments and other nations of the world.</p>
    
<p>The general scope and character of the exhibition will be similar to the exhibitions of Philadelphia, in 1876, Chicago in 1893, and the recent Atlanta exhibition. Each state within the region designated is invited to take part in the management of the exhibition, through its vice president, and all the states and important cities are invited to lend their commendations and endorsement, through their Associations, Conventions, Commercial Clubs, Boards of Trade, City Councils, etc.</p>
    
<p>A bill is now pending in congress, locating the exhibition in Omaha, providing for the admission of exhibits free of duty, and appropriating $200,000 for the erection of suitable buildings for a national exhibit, but limiting the government's liability to expenditures for the purpose expressed in the bill.</p>
    
<p>Col. Doniphan is much pleased with his appointment and is very enthusiastic over the prospects of what promises to be a successful exhibition.</p>

<p>Galveston, Texas, March 7.&#8211;The following letter fully explains its object:</p>
    
<p>Mr. Tom Richardson, Secretary Deep Water Utilization Committee, Galveston, Texas:</p>
    
<p>Omaha, Neb., March 5.&#8211;My Dear Sir: Referring to your recent favor relative to the advantages to be derived from holding the exposition of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories  at Omaha in 1898, with reference to encouraging business with the South, Mexico, Central America and the West Indies, and also the exporting and importing of Western products through the gulf ports, permit me, before taking up these points, to touch upon the origin of the exposition of the products, resources and development of the twenty-four States and Territory lying est of the Mississippi river, from Manitoba and British Columbia on the North to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico on the south, and from the great river on the east to the Pacific ocean on the west, and the Trans-Mississippi congress which has unanimously indorsed it, selecting Omaha as the most central and convenient point where the people living in this vast region can easily congregate.</p>
    
<p>The Trans-Mississippi congress is composed of leading men of all classes, pursuits and professionals living west of the Mississippi river, who come together at stated periods to discuss methods and measures to promote the development and prosperity of these Western States and Territories, recommending such of them as its best judgement dictates, to the National congress, the States and the people for adoption. It knows neither creed, class nor politics, nor any special system of finance, but men of all opinions freely co-mingle and fraternize, with the sole purpose of serving their consistency to the best advantage. In this they act in unison, although the largest liberty of discussion is permitted.</p>
    
<p>The eighth annual session of this congress was held in this city in November last. It had a most notable and successful session. It was composed of high tariff men of all shades of opinion. It was in every sense a representative body of the people of the western half of the Union, form the gulf to the British possessions. In the discussions the fact became apparent that the States lying east of the Mississippi had been favored with great expositions of their resources and development, beginning with the Centennial in 1876 at Philadelphia, and continuing through the New Orleans Exposition, the World's Fair at Chicago and the Cotton States' Exposition at Atlanta, while the Pacific coast was favored by the Midwinter Fair at San Francisco.</p>
    
<p>While no exposition of the growth and prosperity of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, as the East, South, West and Pacific coast had such exhibits, the suggestion was made to have one for the States and Territories west of the Mississippi at some central point, which should be second only to the Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893. This met with instant favor, and the following resolution was offered and unanimously adopted by the congress on a rising vote:</p>
    
<p>Whereas, we believe than an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway, where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth-producing States, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi States, but to all the home-seekers of the world; therefore</p>
    
<p>Resolved, That the United States congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September and October, in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such states and Territories in congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases, to assist in carrying out this enterprise.</p>
    
<p>Such is the account of the Trans-Mississippi congress and the inception of the great exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898.</p>
    
<p>Please observe that it is not a local enterprise. On the contrary, it is to be general in every sense of the word, Omaha to be merely the point selected by the Trans-Mississippi congress and the general government where the exposition is to be held.</p>

<p>Our citizens realizing the honor placed upon them and perceiving the necessity of immediately beginning the work of preparation, have formed an organization under the style of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, in which provision is made for each State and Territory to have an equal representation in the management, through a vice president appointed by the governor of each State and Territory thereof west of the Mississippi river.</p>
    
<p>A matter of pressing importance upon our people was the necessity of securing action on the part of the States of Iowa and Utah, whose legislatures are now in session and will not be again for two years; also the action of congress in the present session. The State of Iowa officially recognized the exposition in the unanimous passage of a joint resolution by the legislature, instructing he congressional delegation of that State to favor National recognition and aid to the exposition. It is needless to say that great commonwealth is enthusiastic in favor of the exposition. Its prominent men and newspapers are outspoken in support of it and to these are added the leading newspapers of Chicago. Thus far the exposition is receiving unanimous support of all organizations to whom it has been presented, notably among the working men and labor organizations throughout the country. The press associations are also favoring it in the  most unanimous manner. Utah will act favorably in a few days, and next winter when the remaining legislatures are in session all of the interested States and Territories will take the action necessary, as the exposition appears to be meeting with universal favor.</p>
    
<p>The States east of the Mississippi and foreign nations will be invited to make exhibits, and there is no doubt the exposition will be unexcelled in splendor over anything ever seen in the Trans-Mississippi region.</p>
    
<p>As to the advantages to be derived from holding the exposition with reference to encouraging business with the South, Mexico, Central American, at the West Indies and South America, as well as Europe and Asia, by reason of one of the principal objects of the exposition. In one of the discussions in the Trans-Mississippi congress leading up to the resolution favoring the exposition, a memorial was offered by a delegate from California asking the present National congress for such legislation as to insure prompt completion of the Nicaragua canal, under the control of the United States government, to insure to American commerce and other nations low tolls and freedom from discrimination of any kind. At the same session Hon. Howel Jones, president of the deep water harbors on the Gulf of Mexico to Western agriculture, showed that on this latitude and longitude (Omaha) the distance to Galveston was 585 miles less than the distance to New York. This being the central point, the difference will vary more or less according to locality. he said the great body of our exports are derived from the far,, (about 74 per cent or $627,216,656 in 1890) and that all of the coffee and seven-eighths of the sugar is imported (or $194,721,363 and $78,547,021 of wines in 1890) and most of the coffee consumed in the territory commercially tributary to Galveston is imported form Southern countries, and the sugar is imported from Cuba. Therefore, by virtue of the shorter route via Galveston, as soon as this new trade is established, the people of the Northwest can import all the coffee and sugar we consume, and save money now paid to the longer route (of say 585 miles) via New York.</p>
    
<p>As to the exports, I am using the figures of the last census because they are official. The value of the cotton and cotton seed oil exported in 1890 amounted to $236,259,970, and the exports of breadstuffs $154,259,970. Of the latter the exports of corn amounted in round numbers to $43,555,000, wheat $45, 275,000 and flour of all kinds $57,980,000. In the same year the value of flour manufactured in the five Northwestern States was: Minnesota $60,158,088, Missouri $34,486,795, Nebraska $6,365,492, Kansas $17,420,475, Iowa $11,833,737, or a total of $130,264,587. I mention the item of flour because you will see that much of it is drawn from Minnesota and Missouri, the two largest Western flour manufacturing States fro export to South American ports via New York, which can be handled to greater advantage at Galveston with a through trunk railroad line, and the completion of the Nicaragua canal, making Galveston or New Orleans the nearest seaport to the Pacific South American states, as well as Europe, Brazil, Mexico and other points on the east.</p>
    
<p>Speaking of the importance of the Nicaragua canal, the Hon. Warner Miller in a recent address to the manufacturers in New York said we furnished $14,000,000 exports to Mexico, or 45 per cent, and took 76 per cent of her imports in 1893. The Central American States imported $21,000,000 of products, of which we furnished 24 1-2 per cent; they exported $30,000,000, of which we took 32 1-2 per cent. The South American States imported $400,000,000, of which we furnished 8 1-4 per cent; they exported $456,000,000, or which we took 45.6 per cent; Cuba exported $87,000,000 , of which we took 81 per cent, and imported $55,000,000 of which we furnished nearly 34 per cent. He said: "There is but one proper way of securing the United States its proper proportion of the vast trade of the Pacific, and that is by the construction of the Nicaragua canal."</p>
    
<p>Owing to its deep water facilities and the possession of a trunk railroad line (the Illinois Central) from Chicago, New Orleans is experiencing an expansion of trade and exports such as that city has never known before. Its exports of corn to Europe in January of the present year show an increase of 2,619,705 bushels, and the Illinois Central is making arrangements for it to attain to much larger proportions.</p>
    
<note type="handwritten">?</note>
    
<p>Before closing this communication I desire to call your attention to the vast wealth and resources of the Trans-Mississippi States, exclusive of the Territories, as compiled in the last census. Comprising two-thirds of the area of the United States, they contained a population of 16,545,506, an increase of nearly 46 per cent in ten years. They had 271,730,999 acres in farm lands, an increase of 49 per cent over 1880. Of these farm lands 158,166,581 acres were improved, an increase of 65 per cent in ten years. The value of farm lands, fences and buildings was $4,651,767,082, an increase of 112 per cent over 1880. The value of live stock on farms was $1,000,297,247, an increase of 81 per cent in ten years. These Trans-Mississippi States had 8,335,484 head of horses and mules, an increase of 75 per cent; 28,180,467 head of cattle, an increase of 84 per cent; 27,995,132 hogs, an increase of 46 per cent, and 16,222,927 sheep, an increase of 28 per cent over 1880.</p>
    
<p>Of dairy products they produced 336,502,311 pounds of butter in 1890, an increase of 87 per cent, and of eggs they produced 299,746,697 dozen an increase of 138 per cent in ten years.</p>
    
<p>The corn crop of 1890 amounted to 1,144,247,152 bushels, an increase of 56 per cent, and the yield of wheat was 242,482,378 bushels, an increase of 42 per cent. In cotton they raised 2,838,684 bales, an increase of 40 per cent, and they raised 297,606,080 pounds of cane sugar, and increase of 40 per cent over 1880. They harvested 29,,918,639 tons of hay in 1890, an increase of 173 per cent. The value of their factory product was $1,381,384,380, an increase of 239 per cent over 18880. This is but a partial account of their productions.</p>
    
<p>Of the aggregate wealth of the States in 1890 it amounted to the enormous sum of $19,661,387,036, an increase of 118 per cent; and that of the Territories was $628,392,459, an increase of 598 per cent, both representing a grand total of $20,289,778,495.</p>
    
<p>As to the advantages to be derived from holding the Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha, with reference to encouraging business with the South and other places, the figures are before you. If not convincing, look at the nine or more transcontinental railroad lines as a result of the demand for the completion of the Union and Central Pacific railroads, and the prodigious development of the country since. The Centennial of 1876 was followed by another remarkable internal development, in spite of the panic of 1878. Since the exposition at New Orleans, note the progress of that city and the Southwest. The World's Fair has been the worldwide in its benefits; and since the Atlanta Exposition the Cotton States are alive with people seeking homes, singly and in colonies.</p>
    
<p>The result of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition will be that it will bring the people of the South, Southwest and West into closer terms, leading to an increase of population of wealth, the formation of powerful North and South trunk railroad lines west of the Mississippi, where there are no navigable streams to Southern seaports, and the deepening and other improvements of the harbors on the Gulf, enabling you to handle your proportionate share of the trade, which you do not now, of the millions of people living in the central regions of this Republic.</p>
    
<p>To my mind, the beneficial results that will accrue to each of the States and Territories comprising the great Trans-Mississippi country from the holding of the exposition, will be so great that to neglect to foster and encourage it, bout by words of cheer and acts of appropriation providing fro State buildings and exhibits, will be to the very material disadvantage and loss of the State failing to so act, and I do not aim to take an optimistic view of the enterprise.</p>
    
<p>We desire the active aid and influence of your own and adjoining States, and trust that same may be exerted at this time in encouraging the passage of an act of congress, recognizing the enterprise and making a liberal appropriation for National buildings and National exhibits, and later on, that yours and adjoining States may take active steps looking to State buildings and State exhibits. The exposition would not be complete without a good representation form your section, and we hope to have it. Yours very truly,</p>
    
<ab>John A. Wakefield, Secretary.</ab>

    <dateline>THE DAILY TRIBUNE: SALT LAKE CITY. UTAH, SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 15, 1896.</dateline>
   
<head type="sub">MR. CARPENTER OF OMAHA.</head>
    
<p>Yesterday The Herald received a pleasant call from Mr. Isaac W. Carpenter, one of Omaha's leading business men en route for the Pacific coast. Mr. Carpenter, in addition to being connected with business interests in Omaha, is also closely identified with the enterprise known as the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898; and incidentally Mr. Carpenter, in his journey to the coast, is creating public opinion favorable to the said exposition. He warns us that he is bu the forerunner of  many that are to follow in the interest of this enterprise, for Omaha's businessmen have determined upon making the exposition a success. The call to join the movement comes at rather an inopportune time for Utah, since we have the burdens of statehood just thrown upon us, and in addition tot hat we are contemplating a great semi-centennial Inter-Mountain Exposition for the state of Utah during the summer of 1897, to commemorate the advent of the Utah pioneers into Salt Lake valley; and just how far this may exhaust our ability to indulge in the exposition business we cannot say; If, after a full consideration of the question by an interchange of thought, the states this side the Mississippi conclude that it will be a good thing to hold the proposed Trans-Mississippi Exposition. Utah will be in it with her neighbors, as her public spirit and love of enterprise will not permit her in such an affair to be conspicuous by her absence. And when it comes to a show-down of products, Utah is in it, both as to variety and abundance, and our interests no less than our pride would demand that we make known our resources that a just share of the home makers coming to the west may be induced to settle in the peaceful and mountain-shadowed valleys of Utah.</p>
    
<p>The Herald wishes you well, Mr. Carpenter, and may the Lord be good to you.</p>

<ab>Hon</ab>
    
<ab>Mayor of the City of Atchinson, Kas.,</ab>
    
<ab>Dear Sir:</ab>
    
<p>At the last session of the Trans-Mississippi Congress, which was held in this city in November, 1895, resolutions were adopted providing for the holding of an exposition for the Trans-Mississippi states and territories at Omaha from May until November, 1898. A bill is now pending before both houses of Congress asking national recognition and an appropriation for a government exhibit. A corporation has been organized in this city under the name of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition for the purpose of facilitating the work. Numerous commercial bodies and municipal corporations throughout the West have endorsed by formal resolution the plan of holding an exposition, which will advertise to the world the resources of the great West. The legislature of the state of Iowa recently passed a joint resolution by unanimous vote of both houses favoring the exposition.</p>
    
<p>I enclose herewith such information as I have at hand regarding the scope and objects of the exposition.</p>
    
<p>Believing that it will materially benefit the entire Trans-Mississippi territory, I respectfully ask that your bring the matter before your City Council, and, if it meets their approval, have resolutions endorsing the project passed and mail a copy of same to me and to your senators and representatives in Congress. By so doing you will conger a favor which I shall be glad to reciprocate.</p>

<p>Please request your newspapers to publish and send a marked copy to my address.</p>

<head type="main">WORKING FOR THE BIG SHOW</head>
    
<div3><head type="sub">AT SALT LAKE CITY. (Salt Lake Tribune.)</head>
 <div4>   
<p>The representatives of Omaha pluck and enterprise reached the city yesterday in a special car, attached to the afternoon Union Pacific train. The specific object of this visit it to work up interest in the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition =, that will be held in the Gate City from June to November of 1898.</p>
    
<p>In the party are Guerdon W. Wattles, vice president of the Union National Bank, who is president of the exposition; Secretary John A. Wakefield, an extensive wholesale lumber dealer; W. R. Bennett, who is at the head of the W. R. Bennett company, the largest department house in Omaha; John H. Evans, president of the Bank of Commerce; Charles Metz, general manager of Metz Bros. Brewing company; Henry A. Thompson, senior member of Thompson, Belden &amp; Co.; G. M. Hitchcock, proprietor of the World-Herald; Z. T. Lindsey, who is at the head of a large rubber goods house; Captain H. E. Palmer, member of the fire and police commission, and City Attorney A. S. Hazelton of Council Bluffs.</p>
    
<p>They will remain in the city several days, during which they hope to meet as many as possible of the leading business and professional men of Salt Lake and Utah. There will be incidental sight-seeing in connection with the visit, though probably this feature will remain very decidedly in the background, as nearly if not quite all of the gentlemen have visited Utah before, and also because of the object of the pilgrimage westward has to do with a project that has already grown very dear to the Omaha heart, and one that already seems placed upon the plane of certitude and success.</p>
    
<p>Recently the moral support of Utah was given the project by a joint resolution, adopted by both branches of the legislature.</p>
    
<p>The city council and board of trade of St. Louis have agreed by resolution to aid the enterprise. Kansas City and other cities have followed with similar promises of support, so that the Omaha men who assumed the burden laid upon them by the Trans-Mississippi congress feel confident of justifying the trust imposed in them.</p></div4>
    
<div4><head type="sub">CAME WITH GENERAL CONNOR.</head>
    
<p>Captain Palmer will probably find more to interest him during the sojourn in Zion than any other member of the party, for the reason that his consists in the revivifying of old friendships and a renewal of bygone memories. Captain Palmer came to the Salt Lake valley with General Connor and was his chief of staff in 1865. In the latter part of that year he left the army for the busy life of a mining camp, and 1867 found him in charge of the Salmon River (Idaho) News. Captain Palmer has been in nearly every mining camp of the west, being like the remainder of the party, a thorough westerner.</p>
    
<p>About a year before General Connor's death Captain Palmer visited Salt Lake and upon calling upon General Connor found that he had just received permission from the war department to be buried in the cemetery at Fort Douglas. Together they went to the post and selected a sunny spot on the hillside, where the general later was laid to rest, Then they staked the corners and departed.</p></div4>
    
<div4><head type="sub">THE ONLY SURVIVOR.</head>
    
<p>Captain Palmer is the only surviving member of General Connor's staff. He says that when the command started eastward everyone believed that its destination was the scene of hostilities in the far east. President Lincoln, the commander of the department of the Pacific, and General Connor were the only one who knew that its destination was Salt Lake City, <unclear reason="torn"/> until the command was halted at the <unclear reason="torn"/>ent site of Fort Douglas did it <unclear reason="torn"/> known what were the intentions of the government. "Many stories have been told of General Connor's first coming to Salt Lake City," said Captain Palmer, "But the truth has usually been missed. General Connor left his command about 100 miles from the city and, disguised as a cowboy, came to Salt Lake City and remained two days, during which he selected for his camp and plateau east of town, where Fort Douglas is now situated. During his visit to town only one man knew of his presence, and he was a trusted friend with whom he stayed."</p></div4></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">THE TIES THAT BIND. (Salt Lake Herald.)</head>

<p>We had a pleasant call last evening from G. W. Wattles, esq., president of the Trans-Mississippi exposition; Captain H. E. Palmer and Editor G. M. Hitchcock of the Omaha World-Herald, all of Omaha. These gentlemen are here in the interest of the Trans-Mississippi exposition. They will find the sentiment of the people of Utah heartily in favor of the exposition, and that the people will do what they can to make it a success. From the cold, unsentimental business point of view they will do this, and they will also do it from the sentimental point of view. The ties that bind Utah to Omaha are the memories of the past, when Omaha was the outfitting point for emigrants to the west. It was from there that the handcart companies and the bull-team trains started for Utah. The gentlemen who have come form Omaha in the interest of the exposition will be welcomed by the people of Utah, who will give this great enterprise all the aid in their power.</p></div3>
    
<div3><head type="sub">WELL RECEIVED. (Salt Lake Herald.)</head>
    
<p>Guerdon W. Wattles, president; John A. Wakefield, secretary; W. R. Bennett, Charles Metz and Henry A. Thompson, directors of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition company of Omaha, together with G. M. Hitchcock, H. E. Palmer, A. S. Hazelton and Z. T. Lindsey, constitute the party of gentlemen which arrived in this city yesterday over the Union Pacific in the interest of the exposition which will be held at Omaha in 1898.</p>
    
<p>Mr. Wattles is the vice president of the Union National bank of Omaha; Mr. Wakefield is the leading lumber merchant of the Gate City; Mr. Bennett company, one of the largest in Omaha; Mr. Metz is the general manager of the Metz Bros. Brewing company; Mr. Thompson, Belden &amp; Co., Mr. Hitchcock is the owner of the World-Herald, the leading paper of the city; Captain Palmer is a member of the fire and police commission and is well known in this region because of his connection at one time as adjutant on the staff of General Connor; Mr. Hazelton is the city attorney of Council Bluffs, Ia., while Mr. Lindsey is the head of one of the largest wholesale rubber goods firms in the west. The party is a representative one in every respect.</p>
    
<p>As stated, the gentlemen are her for the purpose of conferring with the leading men of the state, the governor and other officials, on the matter of having Utah co-operate in the holding of the exhibit in Omaha two years from next June. When informed by a Herald man that the state legislature had already passed a resolution indorsing the scheme the party was greatly pleased, as they had not been so informed and were prepared to make an earnest effort in that direction.</p>
    
<p>However, the fact that this resolution has been passed will not deter them from calling on the governor and other state officers, as well as the prominent men of the city, and urging that this state take an active part in the affair.</p>
    
<p>Mr. Wattles, the president, said last evening that the exposition project was meeting with a great deal of encouragement at the hands of the western states. They were in Cheyenne Saturday, and were received by the governor of Wyoming who, with other representative men, pledged the hearty support of the state. On their return they will stop of at Denver and will talk the matter over with the Colorado officials.</p>

<p>The states in the region between the Mississippi and the Eastern Colorado line have already done much toward the exposition. Iowa's legislature has appropriated $50,000 and expects to appropriate twice that amount in addition. Kansas, Missouri and other adjacent states will be heard from at the sessions of their legislatures this coming winter, and from appearances it would appear as though the display will be a great success, and one which Utah cannot keep away from, if she wanted to.</p>
    
<p>However, it is not the purpose of these gentlemen to rush into the legislature and ask that the doors of the state vaults be opened to allow them to go in and help themselves. On the contrary, the city of Omaha has agreed to raise a round half million for the support of the exposition and it is for the purpose of ascertaining whether the surrounding commonwealths are going to take a part that the citizens send this delegation on a trip to "feel the public pulse."</p>
    
<p>They will today call upon Hon. George Q. Cannon, Hon. Heber J. Grant, Hon. Thomas G. Webber of the Co-op., Hon. Joseph R. Smith, Hon. John Henry Smith, Hon. George M. Cannon, Abram H. Cannon, Governor Wells, Secretary Hammond and other state officers, Hon. John E. Dooley, Hon. R. C. Chambers, May Glendenning, Colonel N. Treweek, Richard Mackintosh, Hon. George M. Scott and other leading citizens, with a view of sounding them for opinions. It is expected that public sentiment can be ascertained in the brief space of one day, so thorough will be the character of the work, but if the ground cannot be all covered, the party will remain over one day longer.</p>
    
<p>Before the members leave they will take a trip to Mercur. They have a Pullman car, which was placed at their disposal by the Pullman company, and Colonel Clayton of the Salt Lake &amp; Los Angeles will have them taken down to Mercur with a special engine.</p>
    
<p>The greater portion of the party have been in Salt Lake years ago, and are loud in their praises of the improvements which have taken place since their first visits here. The fame of Mercur has extended down eastward and the members of the delegation say they must see the place ere they leave.</p>
    
<p>The party spent yesterday in looking over the city, a visit to Fort Douglas being among the pleasures.</p>

                            <p>Cheyenne, Wyo., March 21.&#8212;The delegation of Omaha citizens representing the Trans-Mississippi exposition had a busy day in this city.  The members of the party arrived here at 8 o'clock this morning and soon after their arrival were called upon by a number of representative citizens.  At 11 o'clock the visitors were provided with carriages and, under the guidance of Mayor Merritt, Hon. E. A. Slack of the Sun-Leader, Judge C. F. Miller, Hon. Louis Kirk and others, were driven to Fort Russell and other points of interest about the city.  At 2 o'clock the party, by appointment, called upon Governor Richards at the state capitol to discuss the exposition prospect.  With the governor at the conference were State Engineer Mead, Chief Justice Groesbeck, Justice Conaway, Attorney General Fowler, State Superintendent Miss Reel, representatives from the state treasurer's and secretary of state's office and all the members of the state board of land commissioners.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPLAINS THE OBJECTS.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles of the delegation explained in a comprehensive statement the objects and expectations of the movement for the Omaha exposition, and asked that the representatives of the state of Wyoming join with Nebraska and the other trans-Mississippi states in urging favorable congressional action on the bill now pending in congress to appropriate funds for a national building and exhibit and to the recognition of the exposition as an international affair.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock was called upon and he very clearly pointed out the advantages which would accrue to Wyoming and all of the western states if the exposition could be made a success.  Immigration, he said, comes in periodical waves.  For some time the tendency had been against the west, but he now believed we were on the threshold of an advancing wave of eastern and foreign immigration, and the west, by advertising its resources and home-making capabilities, should be prepared to divert to itself a share of this immigration.  The Atlanta exposition had been of almost untold benefit to the south and, with energy and work for which the west is noted, the Omaha exposition could be made of wonderful aid to the west.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GOVERNOR IS ENTHUSIASTIC.</head>
                            <p>Governor Richards was called upon, and in a very pleasing speech he guaranteed the delegation his personal aid in the promotion of the success of the exposition, and was sure that the entire state would be with him in the matter.  He had at various times been asked to appoint delegations and extend state aid to expositions in Mexico and in the far east.  He had not been very enthusiastic in his responses.  But when the Omaha proposition was brought to his attention he was from the outset willing and anxious to lend it a willing hand.  He had already written to Senators Warren and Clark and Congressman Mondell asking them to support and aid in the passing of the bill appropriating funds for a national building and exhibit.  He had no hesitation in promising to urge the Wyoming legislature, which meets January next, to make an appropriation so that Wyoming may be creditably represented at the Omaha exposition.</p>
                            <p>State Engineer Mead was called upon and said he would give the project his most cordial support.  Many of the interests of the states of Nebraska and Wyoming were identical, and the welfare of one was bound up in that of the other.  Nearly all of the great lines of railway in Wyoming center in Nebraska's greatest city.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WILL DO ALL THEY CAN.</head>
                            <p>Nebraska, he said, is the market place for Wyoming's coal oil and its live stock products.  Omaha capitalists had done more than any other to aid in developing a number of resources, and Wyoming will be glad of an opportunity to reciprocate by doing all she possibly can to aid in making the exposition a grand success.</p>
                            <p>Features of the exposition and its effect upon the west, if successfully carried through, were then made by Captain Palmer, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Hazelton and Mr. Wakefield.  Attorney General Fowler ans Judges Groesbeck and Conaway, in short addresses, told the visitors of some of the resources of Wyoming and explained how beneficial their development would be to Nebraska and Omaha.  Miss Estelle Reel, state superintendent of public instruction, was called upon to speak for the women of the state, and in a very clever talk promised the support of the ladies of Wyoming for the exposition.  After the conference a large number of business men called upon the visitors and arrangements were made for a public meeting during the evening.</p>

                            <p>The public meeting at the city hall was largely attended and was a complete success.  Addresses were made by Mayor Samuel Merrill, ex-Mayor T. F. Stahle, Hon. A. D. Kelly, E. A. Slack, proprietor of the Sun-Leader, and other prominent citizens, and resolutions were adopted pledging the co-operation and support of the citizens of Cheyenne to the work of making the exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>The visitors left at 10 o'clock for Salt Lake City, well pleased with their reception in Cheyenne.</p>

                            <ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
                            <p>Salt Lake City, Utah, March 23.&#8212;The delegation from Omaha has been enthusiastically received by the state officers of Utah and the dignitaries of the Mormon church.  Today the delegation met the presidents of the churches by appointment and received assurances of each president that the exposition would be promoted in every way possible.</p>
                            <p>Governor Wells sent a special message to the legislature notifying the members that the Omaha delegation was in the city and desired a conference.  The speaker of the house and the president of the senate appointed committees on conference and they met the Omaha delegation in the office of Governor Wells, where speeches were made by Messrs. Wattles, Hitchcock and Lindsey of Omaha and Hazelton of Council Bluffs.  Governor Wells responded and was followed by the members of the legislature.  Every member favored the exposition and promised Utah's co-operation.  The legislature of Utah has adopted the following joint resolution without a dissenting vote:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Delegates representing the twenty-four states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river at the trans-Mississippi congress of 1895 adopted a resolution for the holding of an exposition of the products, manufactures, arts and industries of those states and territories, and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The said convention decided to hold the said exposition at Omaha, in the year 1898, and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The common interest of the states and territories constituting this great region will be promoted thereby, and the interests of the state of Utah will be especially benefited by such an exposition, be it therefore</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the senators and representatives from Utah in the national congress by the secretary of state, with the request that they promote as far as possible the said exposition.</p>
                            <p>Many former residents of Omaha have called on the delegation and greatly helped to forward the exposition idea.  Colonel Clayton took the delegates in a special car to see the splendid new pavilion on Salt lake.  The pavilion cost $250,000, is Moorish in style and has a dancing floor for 1,000 couples.  Tomorrow part of the delegation goes to visit the great mining town of Mercur and the other part goes to Ogden to hold a meeting.  The delegation reaches Denver Wednesday evening or Thursday morning and has the assurance of a good reception.</p>
                            <p>In order not to interfere with the Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha Utah has decided to abandon her proposed Inter-Mountain exposition at Salt Lake in 1897.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha delegation is delighted with the interest and enthusiasm manifested in Utah and Wyoming and expects to reach home Friday or Saturday.</p>

                            <p>A committee of prominent citizens met the delegates at the depot and escorted them to the Reed hotel, where an informal reception was held and a dinner served.</p>
                            <p>The people of Ogden are greatly interested in the exposition plans.  They are also feeling very enthusiastic over the approaching completion of the great water power project on which several hundred men are now being employed.

                            <l>(Denver Times.)</l>
                            <p>On Wednesday and Thursday of the present week Denver will entertain ten representatives of the business interests of Omaha&#8212;well known men of that city who are in the west with the idea of awakening interests in the Trans-Mississippi exposition which it is proposed to hold in Omaha in 1898.  It will be the effort of the delegation to get an indorsement from Colorado for the exposition.  At the head of the party is G. W. Wattles, president of the exposition, and he is accompanied by Mr. Wakefield, the secretary; J. R. Dody, G. M. Hitchcock and others.</p>
                            <p>The party left Omaha last week in a special car and arrived in Cheyenne on Saturday.  There they conferred with the governor and other state officials and were given considerable encouragement.  Today they are in Rawlins, and from there go directly to Salt Lake City to meet the members of the state legislature, citizens and state officials.  A letter from Mr. Hitchcock states that they will be in Denver on Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock seems especially anxious to secure the co-operation of Denver and Colorado, especially as this city last year had plans of its own for an exposition.  It is promised that the Omaha affair will by no means be local in its scope, and it is desired to have the entire trans-Mississippi country represented.  During its visit to Denver the delegation will meet prominent citizens and will call on the governor.  At the points where the representatives have been stopping it has been the custom to appoint committees to meet them, and it has been suggested that the chamber of commerce or some other body take the matter up here and see that the visitors are properly entertained.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha proposition is a big one, and it is said that the citizens of that place have taken it up with enthusiasm.  There is already a bill before congress for a government appropriation.</p>

                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi and International exposition to be held at Omaha, beginning in June and ending in November, 1898, now has a complete organization, with a local incorporated company, with vice presidents from the various states.  They are already getting down to effective work and have sent to <choice><sic>businness</sic><corr>business</corr></choice> men's associations, mayors and city councils in each town of the trans-Mississippi territory having a population of 1,000 or more requests for the adoption of resolutions indorsing their enterprise.  Our city council will probably consider such a resolution at its next meeting, and there is no question but it will pass unanimously.  A bill has been introduced in congress making an appropriation for the exposition, and the indications are that it will pass.  Various states are also expecting to make appropriations, and this exposition will beyond question be one of the grandest of its kind ever held in the United States.  These western states are very enthusiastic for this exposition, and they may well afford to be.  Thomas H. Wells of this city, who is South Dakota's vice president, is working up sentiment in the state in its favor.</p>

                            <p>Cheyenne, Wyo., March 21.&#8212;Ten of the leading business men of Omaha, representing the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898, reached here this morning by special train and spent the day in the city working up favorable sentiment for the Omaha project.  The party were met by a number of Cheyenne business men and taken in carriages to Fort Russell and other interesting points about the city.  This afternoon the delegation held a conference with Governor Richards and other state officials at the capitol.  The purposes and benefits of the proposed exposition were set forth by President Hitchcock of the Omaha World-Herald and other members of the delegation.  Governor Richards, in reply, said that he fully indorsed the plans of the Omaha people and had already secured the promise of all of Wyoming's representatives in congress for their support of the bill appropriating funds for a national exhibit and building.  He promised to recommend to the next Wyoming legislature that an <choice><sic>apropriation</sic><corr>appropriation</corr></choice> be made large enough for a creditable exhibit from Wyoming.</p>
                            <p>Addressing indorsing the exposition project were also made by Judges Groesbeck and Conaway of the state supreme court, State Engineer Mead, State Superintendent of Schools Miss Reel, Attorney General Fowler and others.</p>
                            <p>This evening a well-attended public meeting was held in the city hall, where a number of speeches were made favorable to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The visitors left for the west at 10 o'clock and will reach Salt Lake City tomorrow afternoon.</p>

                            <p>Cheyenne, Wyo., March 21.&#8212;A party of leading Omaha business men reached here this morning by special train en route to Salt Lake, Ogden, Denver and other western points, at each of which they will work up interest in the Trans-Mississippi International exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898.</p>
                            <p>In the party are Guerdon W. Wattles, vice president of the Union National bank; John H. Evans, president of the National Bank of Commerce; Charles Metz, general manager of Metz Bros.' Brewing company; Henry A. Thompson of Thompson, Belden &amp; Co.; G. M. Hitchcock, proprietor of the Omaha World-Herald; A. S. Hazelton, city attorney of Council Bluffs; Z. T. Lindsey of the Lindsely wholesale establishment; H. E. Palmer, insurance, and John A. Wakefield, wholesale lumber dealer.</p>
                            <p>While in Cheyenne the party was taken in carriages to Fort Russell and other points of interest about the city and held a very satisfactory conference with Governor Richards and other state officials as to Wyoming's attitude toward the exposition.  Substantial aid was promised the exposition from Wyoming and every effort will be made here to aid in the success of the undertaking of the Omaha people.  The visitors left for the west this evening and will reach Salt Lake tomorrow afternoon.  Ogden and Denver will be visited on the return trip.</p>

                            <head type="sub">G. F. Swift of Swift Packing Company Gives His Opinion.</head>
                            <p>G. F. Swift of the Swift Packing company is at the Paxton today, returning tonight to Chicago.  He has been out to San Francisco for the past two weeks, looking after business interests there.  It was his opinion that San Francisco had suffered less from the financial stringency than most eastern cities, and expressed himself as being very well pleased with the business of the company there.</p>
                            <p>He anticipates that the packing house in South Omaha will soon have a decided increase in business.  Although since last spring there have been fewer cattle to kill, yet everything has gone well, considering.  And there being "oodles" of corn in the cribs, there will be plenty to do in the future.  He thought the cattle loan company projected by P. D. Armour and local capitalists to give cattle men money to operate with, as described in the World-Herald some time ago, was a good thing, although he was not actively interested in it.  He thought that what would benefit the cattle growers would be a good thing for the packing houses.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of expositions, Mr. Swift said he was not informed upon the subject of the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  "Expositions, as a rule, are a good thing for a country," he added; "the world's exposition did Chicago lots of good, and I have no doubt benefited the country at large.  I visited the Atlanta exposition, and considered it a success, except in one respect.  It was held too late in the season, and the weather became disagreeable and cold.  The Trans-Mississippi exposition ought to be a good thing for Omaha, and for the west."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Swift will probably visit the packing house in South Omaha today, and leave for Chicago tonight.</p>

                            <p>The distinguished party, composed of some of the officers and directors of the proposed Trans-Mississippi and International exposition at Omaha in 1898, which arrived in this city last Sunday spent yesterday in reviewing Zion and consulting with some of its leading business men.  To say they were not greatly impressed with the city and its people would be stating an untruth.  Not only were the distinguished gentlemen representing the nucleus of Nebraska and Iowa business enterprise, favorably impressed with the boundless resources of this young state, which they confessed the eastern people know so little about, but the scenes on all sides revealing the result of the pluck and energy of a hardy people was, according to their own statements, beyond expectations.</p>
                            <p>The prime object of their visit here is to interest the people in the proposed exposition to be held at Omaha.  At the close of the day they expressed themselves as entirely satisfied with their mission, and will depart with the assurance from leading business men and legislative members that when the time comes Utah will do her share, realizing as her people do the value of making a display of her resources, as it might be called, at home.</p>

                            <p>During the day the party called upon President George Q. Cannon, upon whose suggestion, more than anyone else, the idea of a Trans-Mississippi exposition was conceived.  Mr. Cannon, as president of the trans-Mississippi congress, and on several occasions a delegate from Utah, has made for himself a name among the Mississippi states.  The party was graciously received by him and every assurance given that Utah would lend her influence to make the enterprise a great success.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CONFERENCE WITH GOV. WELLS.</head>
                            <p>In the late afternoon the distinguished party were conducted to the private office of Governor Wells, where also Secretary of State Hammond and a legislative committee from each of the two branches were present.</p>
                            <p>After introductions all around President Gurdon W. Wattles of the exposition company briefly outlined the objects of their mission.  He expressed his gratitude at meeting the state's executive and at the latter's consideration in arranging for a meeting.  They came not, he said, as a party versed in oratory, but simply as representative business men, interested in the advertising and consequently the upbuilding of the great west.</p>
                            </div4>
                            <div4>
                            <head type="sub">HOW IT ORIGINATED.</head>
                            <p>Taking up the object of their visit to Utah, Mr. Wattles said the exposition was the result of the recommendations of the trans-Mississippi congress.  At the last meeting, held at Omaha, a resolution was passed indorsing such a project.  Since then Omaha's business men took the matter in hand, incorporated a company, elected officers and directors whose business ability was representative, and now only ask that adjoining states that would naturally be benefited by the enterprise lend their influence in securing national recognition.  Omaha itself expects to subscribe $500,000, at least, toward the enterprise and Iowa had done much in the way of assistance.  Mr. Wattles said that the people of his city had not connected themselves with the undertaking unmindful of the hard times and the burden it would mean to the city in a business way.  Omaha had been selected because of its central location and excellent transportation facilities.</p>
                            <p>It was the opportune time, he thought, to advertise when times are hard.  The Atlanta exposition did much to advertise the resources of the south, and the cotton states are already beginning to reap the harvest.  By arranging a great exposition in the west the home seeker and those seeking to multiply their capital would again be turned toward the setting sun.  The advantage to be derived would be great, and although the men at the head of the undertaking did not come to ask anything at the hands of Utah's people, they felt that the exposition would be incomplete without participation by this state.</p>
                            <p>Hon. G. M. Hitchcock, owner of the Omaha World-Herald, was next called upon.  He said the people of his town realized at the outset that the co-operation and support of all the adjoining states would be necessary in order to make the enterprise excusable or successful.  An exposition which is calculated to demonstrate to the east and outer world that the great west has abundant resources awaiting the arrival of investing capital would be a failure or fall far short of its object unless for such aid from the surrounding states.  Therefore all western states should stand together.  Mr. Hitchcock said the promoters realized now more than ever the need of assistance from this state.  Here was represented the pluck and energy of the west; the sights on all hands testified to the great future of the state, and now he believed its resources should be advertised abroad.  The same spirit which is forging Utah to the front rank of western states was needed, he said, to make their exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>Hon. A. S. Hazelton, city attorney of Council Bluffs, was next introduced and spoke in the same vein as those who preceded him.  "We come for two purposes," he said.  "First, on an educational mission.  We wanted to inform you of the object of this enterprise.  We are pleasantly surprised, however, to find that you have already performed one of the objects of our trip&#8212;to secure the passage of a memorial to congress asking for an appropriation.  Then we want your state to be represented, and we come to arouse your enthusiasm in this respect."</p>
                            <p>So far as asking congress for an appropriation, Mr. Hazelton said they were simply asking for something that was their right.  The east and the south had secured national aid and now the rights of the west should be recognized.</p>
                            </div4>
                            <div4>
                            <head type="sub">THE GOVERNOR RESPONDS.</head>
                            <p>Responding, Governor Wells stated having received a letter from the secretary of the exposition company some time ago.  He at once transmitted it to the legislature, and the result was a joint memorial indorsing the undertaking and directing Utah's representatives in congress to use their influence to make it a success.</p>
                            <p>The governor then stated that owing to the peculiar condition that Utah finds itself owing to lately securing statehood he could not pledge any support in a financial way, especially at this session.  Owing to the fact that he did not know just what the revenue will aggregate he would not be willing to ask any appropriation from the present session would take some action in having the state represented as it properly should be.  He also called the attention of the gentlemen to the proposed Pioneer celebration that much of the spare cash would be used in making this celebration a success.</p>
                            <p>Following the governor, Senators Booth, Miller and Candland, representing the senate, and Representatives Taylor, Smoot, Clark and Harris assured the visitors of their hearty support, but coincided with the view of the governor that it would not be advisable to ask an appropriation from the president session.</p>
                            </div4>
                            <div4>
                            <head type="sub">SECRETARY HAMMOND.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Hammond thought Utah would be found on the ground when the proper time comes, and would be a formidable competitor for honors.</p>
                            <p>Z. T. Lindsey, a wholesale rubber merchant and member of the party, thought the benefits to this state resulting from a good display could not well be overestimated.</p>
                            <p>Concluding President Wattles thanked the governor and the legislative members for their assurance of hearty support, which met with the expectations of the entire party.</p>

                            <p>Governor Wells arranged a meeting yesterday for the Omaha visitors and a committee of the legislature for 5 o'clock in his office.  At that hour the small room which does temporary duty as an executive office was crowded as it has never been before.  Private Secretary Case brought in a lot of additional chairs, and when the meeting was ready for business there was hardly room enough for freedom of action.</p>
                            <p>Governor Wells, Secretary of State Hammond and the following members of the committees on manufactures and commerce of the two houses of the legislature were present: Senators Booth, Glen Miller and Candland; <choice><sic>Rrepresentatives</sic><corr>Representatives</corr></choice> Taylor, Smoot, Clark, Maughan and Harris.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha delegation, ten in number, were ushered in by D. C. Evans, who introduced the visitors to the governor, the latter presenting in turn the legislative committeemen.  The Omaha men were Gurdon W. Wattles, John A. Wakefield, W. R. Bennett, John H. Evans, Charles Metz, Henry A. Thompson, G. M. Hitchcock, Z. T. Lindsey, Captain H. E. Palmer, also A. S. Hazelton of Council Bluffs.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MISSION OF THE OMAHAS.</head>
                            <p>When the introductions were over Governor Wells expressed pleasure at meeting the visitors and requested them to state their errand.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles, the chairman of the delegation, responded as follows: "We are not orators, but a delegation of business men from Omaha, come to state a business men from Omaha, come to state a business proposition, in which we think you are interested in a business way.  The trans-Mississippi congress met in Omaha last November, when the question of holding a Trans-Mississippi exposition was discussed.  A resolution was passed favoring the exposition and Omaha was selected as the place.  Since then the people of Omaha have taken hold of the matter.  A corporation has been formed and the people of Omaha and the state will raise about $500,000.  A bill is pending in congress appropriating $250,000.  We realize that the exposition comes at a time when we all feel poor, but we are doing our best to make it a great success.  We have met with great encouragement throughout the west.  Iowa will make an appropriation of $50,000 for a building.  We have been cordially greeted by your governor and other prominent citizens, notably George Q. Cannon.  We hear with pleasure that your legislature has taken cognizance of the exposition.  We believe it will be a wise move for Utah to be represented, for while your resources are great they are not known to many people even in the trans-Mississippi country.  The south has had a great impetus by reason of advertising its resources at the Atlanta exposition and has demonstrated the value of such a display.  There is a great tide of immigration coming, and Utah should prepare to get her share of it.  We ask nothing at your hands now further than your good will."</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock of the World-Herald said: "At the outset of the enterprise we realized that it would be necessary to secure the active co-operation of the states of the entire west in order to make the exposition excusable, if not successful.  An exposition that would fall short of showing all the resources of this great section of the country would be a failure, and hence we ask the assistance of your state and the others of the great west.  I have it on the authority of the editor of the Atlanta Constitution that the beneficial results of the exposition there to the city and the nine co-operating southern states were more than a hundred fold.  Utah's ardent support we must have.  Nowhere else is there such an example of human pluck and human enterprise as we have seen in Utah.  It has fairly made us ashamed of what we have done in Nebraska when we see what you have accomplished in this former desert.  The men who made Utah and the spirit that has made her great we want represented at the Omaha exposition."</p>

                            <p>City Attorney Hazelton of Council Bluffs, Ia., said: "I came along with the Omaha men to tell you how we Iowans feel about this exposition.  At the trans-Mississippi congress there was a sentiment that something was wrong with this western section of the union, and an exposition was decided on to apply the remedy.  Your enterprising fellow citizen, George Q. Cannon, lent valuable aid to the project, and I might say did more for it than any one else.  People in other parts of the country are ignorant of the resources of the west, and the exposition was decided on to acquaint the people of other states with what we have to offer.  When Omaha and Nebraska assumed the obligation of the exposition, Iowa joined heartily in the project and will do all in her power to make the exposition a success.  We want your help in getting the proper legislature through congress, and this you can do through congress, and this you can do through your delegation, who, we are glad to say, are favorable to the enterprise.  If you have any influence with other delegations we ask you to use that to the same end."</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOVERNOR WELLS REPLY.</head>
                            <p>Governor Wells said: "It is already known to you what Utah has done to encourage the exposition in the passage of a resolution.  I don't know what further we can say to you at this time.  I am in hearty accord with you and believe that Utah should be represented.  I know your exposition will be much more successful if Utah is represented than if she is not.  It is my mind, and I think it is the sentiment of the legislature, to have an exhibit at Omaha, but the appropriations for that purpose had better be deferred until the next session, which meets a year from now.  In 1897 we will be 50 years old.  Next July a year it will be a half century since two tired travelers first gazed on Salt Lake valley.  It is possible we shall want some appropriations for a celebration of that event, which is of great importance to us.  Whether that will take the form of an exposition remains to be seen, but you can safely leave the matter to the legislature of next year, which will, in my opinion, do what is right in the premises."</p>

                            <head type="sub">VIEWS OF LEGISLATORS.</head>
                            <p>Senator Booth said it was a great pleasure to meet the visitors.  He knew the great benefits to be gained by the exposition, and thought all the states of the west should aid each other.  He did not think it wise to make any appropriation at this session, owing to the fact that the revenues of the state are still an unknown quantity.  With statehood came increased burdens.  The first state tax had not yet been levied, but he thought the revenues would be ample to meet current expenses and possibly make an appropriation, so that Utah will be represented at Omaha.  He believed the exposition would be a great success.</p>
                            <p>Senator Glen Miller said he had lived near Nebraska and knew very well the pluck and enterprise of the people of Omaha and the indomitable spirit which made the town.  At present Utah has to prepare for housekeeping as a state.  Next year these unusual expenses will not be a burden upon the state.  He believed thoroughly in advertising, and thought the west had been backward in advertising itself.  It had been like Ireland in trying to help others, but subjecting itself.  The Omaha exposition would give the west an opportunity that it should take advantages of to make known its resources.</p>
                            <p>Representative Taylor said he had always admired the enterprise of the people of Omaha and was heartily in sympathy with the spirit of the exposition.  The legislature had passed the resolution with unanimity, and if the revenues would justify it he felt sure the next legislature would make an appropriation to provide for Utah's representation.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ALL SPOKE ONE WAY.</head>
                            <p>Representative Smoot spoke in a similar vein.  He said the people of Utah were conservative, and he hoped the visitors would not be discouraged at not getting positive assurances at this time.  Utah always came to the front at the proper time, and when another legislature <choice><sic>assemled</sic><corr>assembled</corr></choice> he did not doubt but that the state would do as all her citizens ever do&#8212;her full duty.</p>
                            <p>Senator Candland said he was born a Ute, but had visited Omaha and admired the city.  he believed in the exposition, believed it should receive national aid, and believed that Utah should be represented.</p>
                            <p>Secretary of State Hammond added a few words in the same strain.</p>
                            <p>Representative Clark also spoke briefly in favor of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Z. T. Lindsey, the wholesale rubber man of Omaha, said he could say something about Utah which not everybody knew.  Utah has a rubber mine.  He had been interested in it for four years and thought it was a great thing.  It was a peculiar deposit that made the best kind of varnish, and that ought to be exhibited at Omaha.  Mr. Lindsey promised that if Utah appropriated $100,000 she would gain 100,000 people.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles closed the meeting by expressing the thanks of the delegation for their reception and for the promises of aid in the future.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WITH THE FIRST PRESIDENCY.</head>
                            <p>The party waited upon the first presidency in the morning and were received by Presidents Woodruff, Cannon and Smith.  President Wattles of the exposition made an outline of what was proposed to be done, and the methods of achieving the desired results.  His argument was convincing that the exposition would accomplish much for Utah, and the members of the first presidency promised their co-operation and assistance in making it a success.  President George Q. Cannon was in the trans-Mississippi congress at the time the exposition was decided upon and then, as now, believed that by such means Utah's manifold resources, latent or partially developed, might be made profitable by turning to them the eyes of the capital.</p>
                            <p>Then the meeting put off its business and took on a social character and an enjoyable hour was spent in pleasing reminiscences.</p>

                            <p>Denver, Colo., March 26.&#8212;The party of business men from Omaha, representing the proposed Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held in that city in the summer of 1898, arrived in the city last evening in a special car from Utah.  There were ten in the party, including Gurdon Wattles, the president of the exposition company; John A. Wakefield, secretary of the company; G. M. Hitchcock, editor and proprietor of the Omaha World-Herald; John H. Evans, Charles Metz, Henry A. Thompson, Zachary T. Lindsey, H. E. Palmer and A. S. Hazelton.</p>
                            <p>It was explained that the purpose of the visit is to arouse public interest in the trans-Mississippi states in the proposed exposition, and to start all the influence that can be brought to bear to rush through congress at Washington a bill now pending which provides for the erection of a government building at the exposition and thereby give national recognition to the undertaking.</p>
                            <p>The promoters of the exposition represent that it is the first request of the kind from the west, as the west, and hereby becomes of unusual importance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CITY IS ENTHUSIASTIC.</head>
                            <p>At 10 o'clock this morning the party visited Mayor McMurray and was received by his honor and most of the city officials, including the city council.  Mayor McMurray had already been communicated with from Omaha by the officers of the exposition and had transmitted the communication to the city council for action.  Lieutenant Governor Bush happened to be calling upon the mayor at the time of the party's arrival, and he assured the party of Colorado's good will toward Omaha and readiness to assist in the promotion of the exposition.  Some moments of chat preceded the <choice><sic>formalties</sic><corr>formalities</corr></choice> of the visit, and during these moments it was revealed that nearly every one present, who did not live in Omaha had at some time or other had his home there, and that all the Omaha people in the party had at one time or another lived in Colorado.  Among the Omahans, Captain Palmer, now police and fire commissioner of that city, was a Colorado pioneer from the fact that he had been here as an officer of the army in 1861.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles of the Exposition company opened the formalities by telling the mayor that he and his party had come to Colorado to enlist Colorado's support in the proposed enterprise and especially in the important preliminary step of securing national recognition.  He said he thought the time had come for the trans-Mississippi country to be recognized and to begin to force itself forward to the eminence it deserved as comprising nearly two-thirds of the entire territory of the United States.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ITS BENEFITS EXPLAINED.</head>
                            <p>The Omaha exposition, he thought, would do much toward filling up the vacant spots in the vast stretch of land from the Mississippi to the coast.  And he knew of no portion of the west more able to contribute enterprise and push to the exposition than Colorado.  Editor Hitchcock joined President Wattles in paying a tribute to Colorado's "push, will and pluck."  He thought that the partnership of Colorado and Nebraska would be an eminently fitting one, which should be made more complete and thorough.  The one state, he said, is the mineral treasury of the country, if not of the world; the other can be, and is going to be the granary of the world.</p>
                            <p>Mayor McMurray extended a welcome to the visitors "as neighbors" and then assured them that the city would <unclear reason="torn"/>tend its hearty co-operation.  He got a sly bid for Colorado by saying that an invitation from Omaha meant a chance for Colorado to exhibit her own glory.  What Colorado might promise to do in this instance would be merely lending to Omaha what the state would expect to receive back with interest in 1<unclear reason="torn"/> when Colorado proposes to make a monster celebration of the anniversary of the Louisiana purchase.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant Governor Brush assured the visitors that the state at large would be ready with all the influence it could bring to bear at Washington or el<unclear reason="torn"/> where in the interests of the exposition.  He remarked incidentally that he was glad to learn that Nebraska was beginning to see the value of irrigation.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield of the Omaha party stated the practical aid which was now desired from Denver.  It was as stated above, the use of Denver municipal and Denver and Colorado state aid and influence in the pushing of the bill now in congress.</p>
                            <p>Mayor McMurray closed the conference with further assurance and a request that the Omaha officials keep the Denver and Colorado people informed from time to time as to the state of assistance they would need.</p>
                            <p>At 12 o'clock the party withdrew to visit the mining exchange.  Business was suspended for twenty minutes.  President Wattles was there introduced on the floor by President Root of the exchange, and made a brief speech setting forth much the same matter that had been presented at the meeting with the mayor.  Later in the day the mining exchange unanimously passed a resolution indorsing the exposition and asking congress for favorable action.</p>

                            <p>At 2 o'clock the Omaha party called upon Governor McIntyre, by appointment, at the capitol.  Other state officials were also present.  Speech were made by President Wattles, Secretary Wakefield and Mr. Lindsey of Omaha and Mr. Hazelton of Council Bluffs.  Response was made by Governor McIntyre, who warmly indorsed the exposition and pledged to it the hearty support of Colorado.</p>
                            <p>In the evening the Omaha delegates met the directors of the chamber of commerce by special invitation.  Speeches were made by several of the Omaha delegates, including Captain Palmer.  Responses were made by President Steele, Mr. Evans of the street car company, Earl B. Coe of the Denver Times and others.  The directors pledged the support of the city of Denver to the enterprise and evinced great enthusiasm.  Several of them also took occasion to say that Colorado felt such hearty friendship for the Omaha World-Herald on account of its great fight <unclear reason="torn"/> silver that on that account along if no other, anything that the World-Herald asked for would find strong support in Colorado.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha delegation has now finished the labor of its trip and will return to Omaha Saturday afternoon after paying a flying trip to Cripple Creek.  The success of the expedition has been beyond all expectations and the members are enthusiastic.</p>

                            <p>The delegation of Omaha gentlemen who visited Cheyenne today in the interest of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition made the most favorable impression possible.  They carried with them their own credential in their gentlemanly demeanor and intelligent discourse Their was an entire absence of assumption or boasting at same time the visitors evinced a firm confidence in the future of Nebraska and the great west.</p>
                            <p>Wyoming should have a kindly feeling toward Omaha and her capitalists have shown their confidence in the resources of this state by liberal investments in our oil and coal lands, in our lands, cattle and other classes of property.  As to the exposition it promises to be a good thing for the entire west, and if properly utilized by our people will do much to advertise Wyoming and bring settlers to our irrigated lands.</p>
                            <p>We should like to see a liberal attendance at the city hall this evening when the plans and purposes of the exposition will be explained by President Wattles and his associates.  The advantages to be gained by this enterprise will then be apparent to our citizens . The party will leave for Salt Lake at 10 o'clock this evening, and we trust will bear with them a pleasant recollection of their brief stay in this city.</p>

                            <p>A delegation of ten leading business men of Omaha, representing the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition of Omaha, arrived in the city this morning, in a special car on the Union Pacific line.</p>
                            <p>The personnel of the party is as follows: G. W. Wattles, president of the company and vice president of the Union National bank of Omaha; John A. Wakefield, secretary of the exposition, a wholesale lumber merchant; John H. Evans, president of the National Bank of Commerce; Charles Metz, of Metz Brothers, brewers; R. A. Thompson, dry goods merchant; G. M. Hitchcock, publisher of the World-Herald; Z. T. Lindsey, <choice><sic>wholesafe</sic><corr>wholesale</corr></choice> rubber; W. R. Bennett, leading general merchandise store; A. S. Hazelton, the city attorney of Council Bluffs, and H. E. Palmer, insurance.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of these gentlemen is to confer with our citizens, city and state officials, with reference to the international exposition to be held in Omaha, beginning in June and ending in November, 1898, and as far as possible to arrange for the proper representation of our state in that great exhibition.</p>
                            <p>On arriving here the party took quarters at the Inter Ocean and during the early morning hours were called upon by the mayor, city officials, members of the press and prominent business men and the plans of the committee were discussed with much enthusiasm.</p>
                            <p>At 11 o'clock the party was taken out for a drive around the city and to Fort Russell and were greatly pleased with the points of interest seen in their carriage trip.</p>
                            <p>They were accompanied by Mayor Merrill, E. A. Slack, Louis Kirk, C. F. Miller, C. D. Kelley, Robert Morris and others of our citizens.  They were particularly delighted with the bright skies, pure atmosphere and delicious winter climate of our beautiful capital city.</p>
                            <p>At 2 o'clock the party had a very pleasant conference with Governor Richards and other state officials.</p>
                            <p>During the day arrangements were made for a meeting at the city hall this evening, when the plans and the purposes of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition will be fully and ably explained by gentlemen of the Omaha delegation to our citizens who are invited to come out and attend the meeting.  The meeting will begin at 7 o'clock, as the party are to leave the city at 10 p. m. for Salt Lake.</p>
                            <p>Their itinerary from here takes in Salt Lake, Ogden, Denver and return to Omaha.  It is hoped our people will generally attend as we are sure they will be interested in the bright and <choice><sic>brezy</sic><corr>breezy</corr></choice> talks of our Omaha friends.</p>
                            <p>It should be born in mind that the interests of Wyoming are largely connected with Omaha commercially and in our mining development.  Omaha capital is largely invested in the central Wyoming oil fields and various irrigation enterprises as well as in mining.  Her business men are already moving to build a railroad line and an oil pipe line in this state and if we do our part they will work with us cordially and earnestly to develop the grand resources of Wyoming.</p>

                            <p>The resolutions after being adopted will be sent to Secretary Wakefield and by him forwarded to the senators and <choice><sic>sepresentatives</sic><corr>representatives</corr></choice> in congress.  When Secretary Wakefield opened his mail this morning he found a large number of letters from prominent business men, residents of western states, and in each instance they were in favor of the exposition, the writers promising to do all in their power to aid in the pushing of the preliminaries of the big show.</p>

                            <p>While in Cheyenne the party was taken in carriages to Fort Russell and other points of interest about the city and held a very satisfactory conference with Governor Richardson and other state officials as to Wyoming's attitude toward the exposition.  Substantial aid was promised the exposition from Wyoming and every effort will be made here to aid in the success of the undertaking of the Omaha people.  The visitors left for the west this evening and will reach Salt Lake tomorrow afternoon.  Ogden and Denver will be visited on the return trip.</p>

The <unclear reason="torn"/> is to confer with prominent <unclear reason="torn"/> this state concerning the international exposition which will be held in Omaha in 1898.

                            <p>Ten representatives of Omaha pluck and enterprise reached the city yesterday in a special car, attached to the afternoon Union Pacific train.  The specific object of this visit is to work up interest in the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, that will be held in the Gate city from June to November of 1898.</p>
                            <p>In the party are Gurdon W. Wattles, vice-president of the Union National bank, who is president of the exposition; Secretary John A. Wakefield, an extensive wholesale lumber dealer; W. R. Bennett, who is at the head of the W. R. Bennett company, the largest department house in Omaha; John H. Evans, president of the Bank of Commerce; Charles Metz, general manager of Metz Bros. Brewing company; Henry A. Thompson, senior member of Thompson, Belden &amp; Co.; G. M. Hitchcock, proprietor of the World-Herald; Z. T. Lindsey, who is at the head of a large rubber goods house; Capt. H. E. Palmer, member of the fire and police commission; and City Attorney A. S. Hazleton of Council Bluffs.</p>
                            <p>They will remain in the city several days, during which they hope to meet as many as possible of the leading business and professional men of Salt Lake and Utah.  There will be incidental sight-seeing in connection with the visit, though probably this feature will remain very decidedly in the background, as nearly if not quite all of the gentlemen have visited Utah before, and also because the object of the pilgrimage westward has to do with a project that has already grown very dear to the Omaha heart, and one that already seems placed upon the plane of certitude and success.  Mercur's gold-veined hills, however, will engage the travelers one day, as a visit to the camp has already been decided upon.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ORIGIN OF THE ENTERPRISE.</head>
                            <p>It was at the Trans-Mississippi Congress in November of last year that the much-mooted, long-desired Western exposition was decided upon, with the unanimous adoption of this resolution:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the States west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway, where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these wealth-producing States, would be of great value, not only to the trans-Mississippi States, but to all the home-seekers of the world; therefore,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the United States Congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September and October, in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such States and Territories in Congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases, to assist in carrying out this enterprise.</p>
                            <p>Because of its central location, its railroad facilities, its wealth, population, progressiveness and many other advantages, Omaha was selected as the scene of the proposed exposition.</p>
                            <p>The idea that dominated the convention was that the possibilities of the great West were still practically unknown.  In the twenty-four States and Territories lying west of the Mississippi river are sections which, according to reliable estimates, are capable of supporting 70,000,000 people without crowding and still leaving a vast domain for the homeseeker.  The unbounded mineral resources of the mountain States, which had as yet been scarcely scratched by the miner's pick, also are known only in a general way, and it was to advertise all of these to the world that the exposition was decided upon.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WHAT HAS BEEN DONE.</head>
                            <p>In order to facilitate the work of the proposed exposition, a corporation has been formed of prominent Omaha men with a capital stock of $1,000,000, nearly half of which has already been subscribed for.  Bills carrying an appropriation of $250,000 have been introduced in both branches of Congress, by Senator Thurston in the Senate and by Congressman Mercer in the lower house.  The Senate bill has been reported favorably by the committee and is expected to pass.</p>
                            <p>The management will not be local.  Each State and Territory in the Trans-Mississippi region will have a share in it, through the appointment of a vice-president by the Governor, so that the full force and authority of the Federal Government and the government of each one of the interested States and Territories will be fully enlisted in the great enterprise, which will outrival in splendor anything that has been witnessed between the Mississippi river and the Pacific ocean.</p>
                            <p>Iowa has officially recognized the exposition by a joint resolution unanimously passed by both houses of the Legislature, requesting its delegation in the two branches of Congress to favor the bill now before it.  An appropriation of $50,000 for a State building was also made.</p>
                            <p>Recently the moral support of Utah was given the project by a joint resolution, adopted by both branches of the Legislature.</p>
                            <p>The City Council and Board of Trade of St. Louis have agreed by resolution to aid the enterprise.  Kansas City and other cities have followed with similar promises of support, so that the Omaha men who assumed the burden laid upon them by the Trans-Mississippi Congress feel confident of justifying the trust imposed in them.</p>
                            <p>At Cheyenne a most cordial reception was given the party and earnest promises of co-operation made by the most prominent citizens of Wyoming.  Denver will be visited on the return trip.</p>

                            <p>Capt. Palmer will probably find more to interest him during his sojourn in Zion than any other member of the party, for the reason that his consist in the revivifying of old friendships and a renewal of bygone memories.  Capt. Palmer came to the Salt Lake valley with Gen. Connor and was his chief of staff in 1865.  In the latter part of that year he left the army for the busy life of a mining camp, and 1867 found him in charge of the Salmon River (Ida.) News.  Capt. Palmer has been in nearly every mining camp of the West, being, like the remainder of the party, a thorough Westerner.</p>
                            <p>About a year before Gen. Connor's death, Capt. Palmer visited Salt Lake and upon calling on Gen. Connor found that he had just received permission from the War department to be buried in the cemetery at Fort Douglas.  Together they went to the post and selected a sunny spot on the hillside, where the General later was laid to rest.  Then they staked the corners and departed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Party of Representative Gentlemen Who Want to Interest Local People in the Exposition of 1898&#8212;Pleased to Learn That the Legislature Has Passed a Resolution of Encouragement Already&#8212;Will Consult with Prominent People of This City Today.</head>
                            <p>Gurdon W. Wattles, president; John A. Wakefield, secretary; W. R. Bennett, Charlie Metz and Henry A. Thompson, directors of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition company of Omaha, together with Hon. G. M. Hitchcock, H. E. Palmer, A. S. Hazleton and Z. T. Lindsay, constitute the party of gentlemen which arrived in this city yesterday over the Union Pacific in the interest of the exposition which will be held at Omaha in 1898.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles is the vice-president of the Union National bank of Omaha; Mr. Wakefield is the leading lumber merchant of the Gate City; Mr. Bennett is president of the W. R. Bennett company, one of the largest in Omaha; Mr. Metz is the general manager of the Metz Bros. Brewing company; Mr. Thompson is the head of the firm of Thompson, Belden &amp; Co.; Mr. Hitchcock is the owner of the World-Herald, the leading paper of the city; Captain Palmer is a member of the fire and police commission and is well known in this region because of his connection at one time as adjutant on the staff of the late General Connor; Mr. Hazleton is the city attorney of Council Bluffs, Ia., while Mr. Lindsay is the head of one of the largest wholesale dry goods firms in the west.  The party is a representative one in every respect.</p>
                            <p>As stated, the gentlemen are here for the purpose of conferring with the leading men of the state, the governor and other officials, on the matter of having Utah co-operate in the holding of the exhibit in Omaha two years from next June.  When informed by a Herald man that the state legislature had already passed a resolution indorsing the scheme, the party was greatly pleased, as they had not been so informed and were prepared to make an earnest effort in that direction.</p>
                            <p>However, the fact that this resolution has been passed will not deter them from calling on the governor and other state officers, as well as the prominent men of the city and urging that this state take an active part in the affair.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles, the president, said last evening that the exposition project was meeting with a great deal of encouragement at the hands of the western states.  They were in Cheyenne Saturday, and were received by the governor of Wyoming who, with other representative men, pledged the hearty support of the state.  On their return they will stop off at Denver and will talk the matter over with the Colorado officials.</p>
                            <p>The states in the region between the Mississippi and the eastern Colorado line have already done much toward the exposition.  Iowa's legislature has appropriated $50,000 and expects to appropriate twice that amount in addition.  Kansas, Missouri and other adjacent states will be heard from at the sessions of their legislatures this coming winter, and from appearances it would appear as though the display will be a great success, and one which Utah cannot keep away from, if she wanted to.</p>
                            <p>However, it is not the purpose of these gentlemen to rush into the legislature and ask that the doors of the state vaults be opened to allow them to go in and help themselves.  On the contrary, the city of Omaha has agreed to raise a round half million for the support of the exposition and it is for the purpose of ascertaining whether the surrounding commonwealths are going to take a part that the citizens send this delegation on a trip to "feel the public pulse."</p>
                            <p>They will today call upon Hon. George Q. Cannon, Hon. Heber J. Grant, Hon. Thomas G. Webber, of the Co-op., Hon. Joseph F. Smith, Hon. John Henry Smith, Hon. George M. Cannon, Abram H. Cannon, Governor Wells, Secretary of State Hammond and other state officers, Hon. John E. Dooly, Hon. R. C. Chambers, Mayor Glendinning, Colonel N. Treweek, Richard Mackintosh, Hon. George M. Scott and other leading citizens, with a view of sounding them for opinions.  It is expected that the public sentiment can be ascertained in the brief space of one day, so thorough will be the character of the work, but if the ground cannot be all covered, the party will remain over one day longer.</p>
                            <p>Before the members leave they will take a trip to Mercur.  They have a Pullman car, which was placed at their disposal by the Pullman company, and Colonel Clayton, of the Salt Lake &amp; Los Angeles,will have them taken down to Mercur with a special engine.</p>
                            <p>The greater portion of the party have been in Salt Lake years ago, and are loud in their praises of the improvements which have taken place since their first visits here.  The fame of Mercur has extended down eastward and the members of the delegation say they must see the place ere they leave.</p>
                            <p>The party spent yesterday in looking over the city, a visit to Fort Douglas being among the pleasures.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Thompson said he had received letters from the A. P. A. organization in Ohio heartily indorsing McKinley, and since then his paper had laid down in its fight against the Ohio man.  The officials of the order in the Buckeye state had investigated the career of the protectionist and had pronounced him all right&#8212;which certificate of character had been accepted by the friends of the order in this state.  It was for this reason that the order felt satisfied that any delegation to be selected from this state in the interest of McKinley would be satisfactory to the A. P. A., hence it would not risk complicating the matters by making a contest.</p>

                            <p>Gov. Wells arranged a meeting yesterday for the Omaha visitors and a committee of the Legislature for 5 o'clock in his office.  At that hour the small room which does temporary duty as an executive office was crowded as it has never been before.  Private Secretary Case brought in a lot of additional chairs, and when the meeting was ready for business there was hardly room enough for freedom of action.</p>
                            <p>Gov. Wells, Secretary of State Hammond and the following members of the Committees on Manufactures and Commerce of the two houses of the Legislature were present:  Senator Booth, Glen Miller and Candland; Representatives Taylor, Smoot, Clark, Maughan and Harris.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha delegation, ten in number, were ushered in by D. C. Evans, who introduced the visitors to the Governor, the latter presenting in turn the Legislative committeemen.  The Omaha men were Gurdon W. Wattles, John A. Wakefield, W. R. Bennett, John H. Evans, Charles Metz, Henry A. Thompson, G. M. Hitchcock, Z. T. Lindsey, Capt. H. E. Palmer, also A. S. Hazelton of Council Bluffs.</p>

                            <p>When the introductions were over, Gov. Wells expressed pleasure at meeting the visitors, and requested them to state their errand.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles, the chairman of the delegation, responded as follows: "We are not orators, but a delegation of business men from Omaha came to state a business proposition, in which we think you are interested in a business way.  The trans-Mississippi congress met in Omaha last November, when the question of holding a trans-Mississippi exposition was discussed.  A resolution was passed favoring the exposition, and Omaha was selected as the place.  Since then the people of Omaha have taken hold of the matter.  A corporation has been formed, and the people of Omaha and the State will raise about a half million dollars.  We realize that the exposition comes at a time when we all feel poor, but we are doing our best to make it a success.  We have met with great encouragement throughout the West.  Iowa will make an appropriation of $50,000 for a building.  We have been cordially greeted by your Governor and other prominent citizens, notably George Q. Cannon.  We hear with pleasure that your Legislature has taken cognizance of the exposition.  We believe it will be a wise move for Utah to be represented, for while your resources are great they are not known to many people even in the trans-Mississippi country.  The South has had a great impetus by reason of advertising its resources at the Atlanta exposition, and has demonstrated the value of such a display.  There is a great tide of immigration coming, and Utah should prepare to get her share of it.  We ask nothing at your hands now, further than your good will."</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock, editor of the World-Herald, said: "At the outset of the enterprise we realized that it would be necessary to secure the active co-operation of the States of the entire West in order to make the exposition excusable, if not successful.  An exposition that would be well short of showing all the resources of this great section of the country would be a failure, and hence we request the assistance of your State the <unclear reason="torn"/> the great West.  I have it on the authority of the editor of the Atl<unclear reason="torn"/>ution that he beneficial res<unclear reason="torn"/>position there to the city<unclear reason="torn"/> nine co-operating Southern States were more than a hundred-fold.  Utah's ardent support we must have.  Nowhere else is there such an example of human pluck and human enterprise as we have seen in Utah.  It has fairly made us ashamed of what we have done in Nebraska when we see what you have accomplished in this former desert.  The men who made Utah and the spirit that has made her great we want represented at the Omaha exposition."</p>

                            <p>City Attorney Hazelton of Council Bluffs, Ia., said: "I came along with the Omaha men to tell you how we Iowans feel about this exposition.  At the trans-Mississippi congress there was a sentiment that something was wrong with this Western section of the Union, and an exposition was decided on to apply the remedy.  Your enterprising fellow citizen, George Q. Cannon, lent valuable aid to the project, and I might say did more for it than any one else.  People in other parts of the country are ignorant of the resources of the West, and the exposition was decided on to acquaint the people of other State with what we have to offer.  When Omaha and Nebraska assumed the obligation of the exposition, Iowa joined heartily in the project and will do all in her power to make the exposition a success.  We want your help in getting the proper legislation through Congress, and this you can do through your delegation, who, we are glad to say, are favorable to the enterprise.  If you have any influence with other delegations, we ask you to use that to the same end."</p>

                            <p>Gov. Wells said: "It is already known to you what Utah has done to encourage the exposition in the passage of a resolution.  I don't know what further we can say to you at this time.  I am in hearty accord with you and believe that Utah should be represented.  I know your exposition will be much more successful if Utah is represented than if she is not.  It is my mind, and I think it is the sentiment of the Legislature, to have an exhibit at Omaha, but the appropriations for that purpose had better be deferred until the next session, which meets a year from now.  In 1897 we will be 50 years old.  Next July a year it will be a half century since two tired travelers first gazed on Salt Lake valley.  It is possible we shall want some appropriations for a celebration of that event, which is of great importance to us.  Whether that will take the form of an exposition remains to be seen, but you can safely leave the matter to the Legislature of next year, which will, in my opinion, do what is right in the premises."</p>

                            <head type="sub">VIEWS OF LEGISLATORS.</head>
                            <p>Senator Booth said it was a great pleasure to meet the visitors.  He knew the great benefits to be gained by the exposition, and thought all the States of the West should aid each other.  He did not think it wise to make any appropriation at this session, owing to the fact that the revenues of the State are still an unknown quantity.  With Statehood came increased burdens.  The first State tax had not yet been levied, but he thought the revenues would be ample to meet current expenses and possibly make an appropriation for the exposition.  But next year the exact amount of revenue would be known, and the next Legislature would, no doubt, if possible, make an appropriation so that Utah will be represented at Omaha.  He believed the exposition would be a great success.</p>
                            <p>Senator Glen Miller said he had lived near Nebraska and knew very well the pluck and enterprise of the people of Omaha and the indomitable spirit which made the town.  At present Utah has to prepare for housekeeping as a State.  Next year these unusual expenses will not be a burden upon the State.  He believed thoroughly in advertising, and thought the West had been backward in advertising itself.  The Omaha exposition would give the West an opportunity that it should take advantage of to make known its resources.</p>
                            <p>Representative Taylor said he had always admired the enterprise of the people of Omaha and was heartily in sympathy with the spirit of the exposition.  The Legislature had passed the resolution with unanimity, and if the revenues would justify it he felt sure the next Legislature would make an appropriation to provide for Utah's representation.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>Representative Smoot spoke in a similar vein.  He said the people of Utah were conservative, and he hoped the visitors would not be discouraged at not getting positive assurances at this time.  Utah always came to the front at the proper time, and when another Legislature assembled he did not doubt but the State would do as all her citi-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Senator Candland said he was born a Ute, but had visited Omaha and admired the city.  He believed in the exposition, believed it should receive National aid, and believed that Utah should be represented.</p>
                            <p>Secretary of State Hammond added a few words in the same strain.</p>
                            <p>Representative Clark also spoke briefly in favor of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Representative Harris closed the greetings of the home people, expressing confidence that Utah would fall in line next year.</p>
                            <p>Z. T. Lindsey, the wholesale rubber man of Omaha, said he could say something about Utah which not everybody knew.  Utah has a rubber mine.  He had been interested in it for four years and thought it was a great thing.  It was a peculiar deposit that made the best kind of varnish, and that ought to be exhibited at Omaha.  Mr. Lindsey promised that if Utah appropriated $100,000 she would gain 100,000 people.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles closed the meeting by expressing the thanks of the delegation for their reception and for the promises of aid in the future.</p>

President Wattles of the exposition made an outline of what was proposed to be done, and the methods of achieving the desired results.  His argument was convincing that the exposition would accomplish much for Utah, and the members of the First Presidency promised their co-operation and assistance in making it a success.  President George Q. Cannon was in the trans-Mississippi congress at the time the exposition was decided upon and then, as now, believed that by such means Utah's manifold resources, latent or partially developed, might be made profitable by turning to them the eyes of the capital.</p>
                            <p>Then the meeting put off its business and took on a social character and an enjoyable hour was spent in pleasing reminiscences.</p>
                            <p>At 2 o'clock the visitors boarded a special train and proceeded to Saltair, the guests of Col. N. W. Clayton, president of the Great Salt Lake &amp; Los Angeles railroad.  A very pleasant afternoon was spent, and the party returned with additional appreciation of the beauties and resources of Utah's capital.</p>

                            <p>The distinguished party composed of some of the officers and directors of the proposed Trans-Mississippi and International exposition at Omaha in 1898, which arrived in this city last Sunday, spent yesterday in reviewing Zion and consulting with some of its leading business men.  To say they were not generally impressed with the city and its people, would be stating an untruth.  Not only were the distinguished gentlemen representing the nucleus of Nebraska and Iowa business <choice><sic>enterprize</sic><corr>enterprise</corr></choice>, favorably impressed with the boundless resources of this young state, which they confessed the eastern people know so little about, but the scenes on all sides revealing the result of the pluck and energy of a hardy people was, according to their own statements, beyond expectations.</p>
                            <p>The prime object of their visit here is to interest the people in the proposed exposition to be held at Omaha.  At the close of the day they expressed themselves as entirely satisfied with their mission, and will depart with the assurance from leading business men and legislative members that when the

                            this comes, Utah will do her share, realizing as her people do the value of making a display of her resources, as it might be called, at home.</p>

                            <p>During the day the party called upon President George Q. Cannon, upon whose suggestion, more than anyone else, the idea of a trans-Mississippi exposition was conceived.  Mr. Cannon, as president of the Trans-Mississippi congress, and on several occasions a delegate from Utah, has made for himself a name among the Mississippi states.  The party was graciously received by him and every assurance given that Utah would lend her influence to make the enterprise a great success.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CONFERENCE WITH GOVERNOR WELLS.</head>
                            <p>In the late afternoon the distinguished party were conducted to the private office of Governor Wells, where also Secretary of State Hammond and a legislative committee from each of the two branches were present.</p>
                            <p>After introductions all around, President Gurdon W. Wattles of the exposition company briefly outlined the object of their mission.  He expressed his gratitude at meeting the state's executive and at the latter's consideration in arranging for a meeting.  They came not, he said, as a party versed in oratory, but simply as representative business men, interested in the advertising and consequently the up-building of the great west.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HOW IT ORIGINATED.</head>
                            <p>Taking up the object of their visit to Utah, Mr. Wattles said the exposition was the result of the recommendations of the Trans-Mississippi congress.  At the last meeting, held at Omaha, a resolution was passed endorsing such a project.  Since then Omaha's business men took the matter in hand, incorporated a company, elected officers and directors whose business ability was representative, and now only ask that adjoining states that would naturally be benefited by the enterprise, lend their influence in securing national recognition.  Omaha itself expects to subscribe half a million, at least, toward the enterprise and Iowa had done much in the way of assistance.  Mr. Wattles said that the people of his city had not connected themselves with the undertaking unmindful of the hard times and the burden it would mean to the city in a business way.  Omaha had been selected because of its central location and excellent transportation facilities.</p>
                            <p>It was the opportune time, he thought to advertise when times are hard.  The Atlanta exposition did much to advertise the resources of the south, and the cotton states are already beginning to reap the harvest.  By arranging a great exposition in the west the home-seeker and those seeking to multiply their capital would again be turned toward the setting sun.  The advantage to be derived would be great, and although the men at the head of the undertaking did not come to ask anything at the hands of Utah's people, they felt that the exposition would be incomplete without participation by this state.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">EDITOR HITCHCOCK.</head>
                            <p>Hon. G. M. Hitchcock, owner of the Omaha World-Herald, was next called upon.  He said the people of his town realized at the outset that the co-operation and support of all the adjoining states would be necessary in order to make the enterprise excusable or successful.  An exposition which is calculated to demonstrate to the east and outer world that the great west has abundant resources awaiting the arrival of investing capital would be a failure or fall far short of its object unless for such aid from the surrounding states.  Therefore all western states should stand together.  Mr. Hitchcock said the promoters realized now more than ever the need of assistance from this state.  Here was represented the pluck and energy of the west; the sights on all hands testified to the great future of the state, and now he believed its resources should be advertised abroad.  The same spirit which is forging Utah to the front rank of western states was needed, he said, to make their exposition a success.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ATTORNEY HAZELTON.</head>
                            <p>Hon. A. S. Hazelton, city attorney of Council Bluffs, was next introduced, and spoke in the same vein as those who preceded him.  "We come for two purposes," he said.  "First, on an educational mission.  We wanted to inform you of the object of this enterprise.  We are pleasantly surprised, however, to find that you have already performed one of the objects of our trip&#8212;to secure the passage of a memorial to congress asking for an appropriation.  Then we want your state to be represented, and we come to arouse your enthusiasm in this respect."</p>
                            <p>So far as asking congress for an appropriation, Mr. Hazelton said they were simply asking for something that was their right.  The cast and the south had secured national aid and now the rights of the west should be recognized.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">THE GOVERNOR RESPONDS.</head>
                            <p>Responding, Governor Wells stated having received a letter from the secretary of the exposition company some time ago.  He at once transmitted it to the legislature, and the result was a joint memorial endorsing the undertaking and directing Utah's representatives in congress to use their influence to make it a success.</p>
                            <p>The governor then stated that owing to the peculiar condition that Utah finds itself owing to lately securing statehood, he could not pledge any support in a financial way, <choice><sic>especialy</sic><corr>especially</corr></choice> at this session.  Owing to the fact that we do not know just what the revenue will aggregate, he would not be willing to ask any appropriation from the present session, but had reason to hope that the next session would take some action in having the state represented as it properly should be.  He also called the attention of the gentlemen to the proposed Pioneer celebration here next year, and thought it probable that much of the spare cash would be used in making this celebration a success.</p>
                            <p>Following the governor, Senators Booth, Miller and Candland, representing the senate, and Representatives Taylor, Smoot, Clark and Harris assured the visitors of their hearty support, but coincided with the view of the governor that it would not be advisable to ask an appropriation from the present session.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SECRETARY HAMMOND.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Hammond thought Utah would be found on the ground when the proper time comes, and would be a formidable competitor for honors.</p>
                            <p>Z. T. Lindsay, a wholesale rubber merchant and member of the party, thought the benefits to this state resulting from a good display could not well be overestimated.</p>
                            <p>Concluding President Wattles thanked the governor and the legislative members for their <choice><sic>assurrance</sic><corr>assurance</corr></choice> of hearty support, which met with the expectations of the entire party.</p>

Today the party will continue to see some of the leading business men, and before going east will visit Mercur.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ten of Her Most Enterprising Business Men Visit Ogden in the Interest of Their Great Exposition&#8212;Interesting Interviews.</head>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon at about 4 o'clock Mayor Spencer and Senator Allison telephoned Auditor Beardsley to notify the business men that the Omaha representatives of the proposed Omaha, Transmississippi and International exposition would arrive in Odgen at 5 o'clock and to have as many business men as possible down at the train to meet them.  The information was circulated as rapidly as possible and a goodly delegation of Ogden's business men met them and escorted them to the Reed hotel where an informal reception was held.  Those who had been unable to go to the train met the gentlemen at the Reed.  Carriages had been provided and the program was to go up the canyon and see the work of construction on the great power plant, but as their time was limited and they desired to meet as many citizens as possible, this part of the program was omitted.</p>
                            <p>A STANDARD representative was among those who met the party at the at the train.  F. J. Hendershot kindly introduced him to the members of the party whose names and occupations are as follows:  George W. Wattles, president of the proposed exposition and vice president of the Omaha National Bank; J. A. Wakefield, secretary of the exposition and a wholesale lumberman of Omaha; G. M. Hitchcock, editor of the World-Herald of Omaha and a staunch and aggressive fighter for free coinage of silver; L. T. Lindsay, wholesale rubber goods merchant; Hon. H. E. Palmer, business man and member of the fire and police board of Omaha; A. S. Hazelton, city attorney of Council Bluffs, Ia.; H. A. Thompson, president of Thompson, Belden &amp; Co., Omaha; Charles Metz, general manager of the Metz Brewing Co.; J. A. Evans, prest. of the National Bank of Commerce and W. R. Bennett, president of the W. R. Bennett Co.  All of these gentlemen are directors of the proposed exposition.</p>
                            <p>They were a very bright, energetic appearing body of men, very sociable and agreeable to all.  Mr. Wattles, the leader of the party as well as other members of the party expressed themselves in a very enthusiastic manner with reference to the encouragement received.  Mr. Wattles said the exposition was a gigantic undertaking, but would attract the attention of the world to the west as nothing else would and would do for the west what the late Atlanta exposition has done for the south.  Speaking of Utah he said:  "You have a wonderful state, a magnificent state.  From what I have seen I feel convinced that Utah is destined to be one of the greatest states in the Union.  You can build a wall around Utah and live within its confines and need for nothing."  The whole party expressed themselves as simply delighted with the climate and products of Utah.</p>
                            <p>The party left here at 8:20 p. m. direct for Denver via the Union Pacific.  They are visiting only three states on this tour, viz., Wyoming, Utah and Colorado.</p>
                            <p>They are very sanguine of having an exposition in 1898 that will nearly, if not quite, equal the great Columbian fair at Chicago in 1893, and the purpose of the exposition is to advertise to the world the wonderful resources awaiting development in the west.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Omaha sends a delegation to Denver to enlist the co-operation of the people of Colorado in the Transmississippi exposition, to be held in the Nebraska city in 1898.  The delegation, which consists of ten representative men from Omaha, will arrive from Salt Lake City today, having had a most successful visit in the new state.  In the party are the following gentlemen: Gurdon W. Wattles, John A. Wakefield, W. R. Bennett, John H. Evans, Charles Metz, Henry A. Thompson, G. M. Hitchcock, Z. T. Lindsey, Captain H. E. Palmer, also A. S. Hazelton of Council Bluffs.</p>
                            <p>The exposition was first thought of last November, when the Transmississippi congress met in Omaha.  The idea found instant favor with the citizens of Nebraska, who have since then been earnestly working for the realization of a project that promises much benefit to all the interests of the West.  A corporation has been formed, and the people of Nebraska promise to raise at least half a million dollars, while a bill for the appropriation of $250,000 is pending in congress.  Iowa has set aside $50,000 for a building and will help in many ways.</p>

                            <p>A telegram received by The Times today announces that the mission to Utah has been more successful than the most enthusiastic dared to hope.  The delegation was received Monday by the governor and committees from both houses of the legislature.  In a most cordial speech, Governor Wells declared that doubtless Utah would send an exhibit, although an exposition to celebrate the half century of her history had been talked of.</p>
                            <p>Leading Denver citizens will welcome the Omaha delegation at the Brown Palace hotel this evening, and a meeting with the governor, the president of the mining exchange, the president of the chamber of commerce, and representatives of the city's various public enterprises will be arranged for to-morrow.</p>
                            <p>Gurdon W. Wattles is chairman of this visiting delegation.  He is a prominent business man of Omaha, and has been chosen for this important task of arousing interest in the exposition project on account of his executive ability and indomitable energy.  A. S. Hazleton, who is Iowa's envoy, is city attorney of Council Bluffs, Omaha's neighbor, which takes almost a proprietary interest in the successful culmination of the enterprise.</p>

                            <p>Colorado will feel a special interest in Gilbert M. Hitchcock, the owner and editor of the World-Herald, the silver champion in Nebraska journalism.  Mr. Hitchcock is the son of the late Senator Hitchcock, who made a brilliant record in the Republican ranks of the United States senators.  After being graduated from Ann Arbor he was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Omaha.  His natural inclination being toward journalism he left his profession to establish the Omaha World, an evening paper that soon met with remarkable success, and was designated by Max O'Rell as one of the three American newspapers that bore the distinction of publishing really witty paragraphs.  About eight years ago Mr. Hitchcock purchased the Herald, a morning paper, consolidating it with the World, and it has since occupied a wide western field.</p>
                            <p>An ardent advocate of silver, the paper has fought most valiantly for bimetallism and has gained a tremendous following in Nebraska.  Mr. Hitchcock supported W. J. Bryan in his first candidacy for congress and has always been the silver orator's most consistent friend.  Since his retirement to private life Mr. Bryan has been a constant contributor to the editorial columns of the World-Herald.  Colorado and the West owe a great debt to the efforts of the Nebraska newspaper and the Nebraska statesman, and doubtless the silver state will show its appreciation by sending a magnificent exhibit to the Transmississippi exposition.</p>

                            <p>The idea of holding an industrial exposition specially for the Transmississippi territory was first conceived during the sessions of the Transmississippi Congress held in Omaha last November.  Before the adjournment of that body the association which is to carry through the project was created in embryo by resolution.  Officers were then chosen and the association incorporated for the purpose of holding in Omaha in 1898 "an exposition of all the products, industries and capabilities generally of the said states and territories west of the Mississippi river."</p>
                            <p>Since the promoters of the scheme took on corporate existence they have used every legitimate means to assure the success of the proposed exposition.  In both the national Senate and House of Representatives bills have been introduced recognizing it as an international exposition and appropriating the sum of $250,000 for the purpose of erecting buildings for governmental exhibits.  The state of Iowa has also come forward with aid.  There both legislative bodies have passed resolutions indorsing the enterprise and calling on Congress to pass the subsidy bill.  There is also pending in the Iowa Legislature a bill ordering the appropriation of $50,000 for state buildings at the exposition, and the appointment of a commission to have charge of the Iowa exhibit thereto.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Resolutions Adopted.</head>
                            <p>While the Omaha delegation was in Utah the Legislature of that state rushed through the following preamble and resolutions:</p>
                            <p>"Whereas, Delegates representing the 24 states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river, at the Transmississippi Congress of 1895, adopted a resolution providing for the holding of an exposition of the products, manufactures, arts and industries of these states and territories; and</p>
                            <p>"Whereas, The said convention voted to hold the said exposition at Omaha, Neb., in the year 1898; and</p>
                            <p>"Whereas, The common interest of the states and territories constituting this great region will be promoted thereby, and the interests of the state of Utah will be especially benefited by such an exposition,</p>
                            <p>"Be it therefor resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Utah, That the holding of the said Transmississippi Exposition is heartily approved and that the people of Utah are urged to co-operate with the people of the other states of the Transmississippi region and to take this opportunity of making a fitting display of their resources, and</p>
                            <p>"Be it further resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the senators and representative from Utah in the national Congress by the secretary of state, with the request that they promote, as far as possible, the said exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">A Cordial Reception.</head>
                            <p>Wherever they have been during their tour of promotion, the exposition boomers have been given a support in their undertaking by public officials and commercial men.  They are to remain in Denver until Friday night, and will confer with the governor, mayor of the city, heads of the different state departments and officers and members of the various business associations.  A short visit will also be made to Cripple Creek by a majority of delegates.</p>
                            <p>"We have met with most enthusiastic receptions in all the sections of the West so far visited by us," said Gurdon W. Wattles last evening. "Encouragement and promises of co-operation in our work have come to us from every source.  The exposition is not to be an Omaha undertaking; it is intended to benefit the entire West and the country at large.  Our special purposes are to show to the United States, and the world what the Transmississippi section is doing and can do in industrial lines; to bring capital here for the development of our vast and almost virgin natural resources of wealth, and to divert to the West the streams of immigration which now flows Southward.</p>
                            <p>The people of Nebraska are a unit in their desire to advance the interests of the project and to ensure a successful exposition.  We have the pledges of nearly every banker and important business man in Omaha to take stock in the exposition association, and they are all working shoulder to shoulder for its objects.</p>
                            <p>"Other Western states are showing equal zeal.  Iowa has promised an appropriation of $50,000.  Utah will introduce a bill for another big appropriation at next winter's session of its Legislature and we are assured of a third appropriation in Wyoming.  Two bills in the National Congress, providing for a $250,000 appropriation, are receiving such support that we have no fears regarding their passage.</p>

                            <head type="sub">For Colorado's Aid.</head>
                            <p>"We shall expect strong aid from this state.  The exposition will give Colorado an excellent and timely opportunity to advertise her mineral <choice><sic>w ealth</sic><corr>wealth</corr></choice> and other resources.  A big exhibit will open the eyes of the East and foreign countries to what Colorado has to offer, and bring settlers as well as capital here.  IF the entire West will only put itself forward and begin now to prepare for sending exhibits, the Omaha exposition will confer a greater benefit on our section of the continent than any enterprise we have undertaken for years past.  All the present indications are that this will be done."</p>
                            <p>From Mr. Wattles an account of the party's progress up to date was obtained.  On Friday last himself and his fellow delegates left Omaha on a special car furnished them by the Pullman company.  They reached Cheyenne, Wyo., on Saturday morning and were received by Gov. Richards, Mayor Merrill and other state and city officials.  "They gave us all the encouragement it was possible for them to give," is how Mr. Wattles describes his reception by the Wyomingites.  "They promised us not only their undivided support, but pledged the assistance of Wyoming to the exposition."</p>
                           <p>Saturday evening the delegation left Cheyenne, arriving in Salt Lake on the following evening.  At 11 a. m. next day they called, by invitation, on Presidents Buchanan, Smith and Woodruff of the Mormon church.  George Buchanan was a delegate from Utah to the Transmississippi congress and takes a lively interest in the exposition scheme.</p>

                            <head type="sub">The Idea Popular.</head>
                            <p>The three presidents introduced them to the leading elders and apostles of the Mormon church, and an interchange of opinions followed.  The exposition idea seemed to be very popular with the Mormon dignitaries, who pledged the support of their people.  They were generally desirous of advertising the resources of their new state.  In the evening the representatives of Mormonism took the Nebraskans on an excursion trip to Saltair.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile Gov. Wells prepared to receive the visitors.  Both branches of the Legislature were in session and he sent them a message, asking that they meet the Omaha men in his office at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  Similar invitations were dispatched to the state officials.  When the meeting took place President Wattles and other exposition promoters explained the objects of the exposition and the scope of what it proposed doing.  Gov. Wells and other officials responded, expressing their sympathy with the enterprise and their intention to give it financial and moral support.</p>
                            <p>On Tuesday the delegates were received by the mayor and other municipal officers, all of whom assured their support to the industrial show.  At 3 p. m. the party left for Ogden, where they were met at the train by a deputation of officials and prominent business men, who entertained them during the four hours they remained in the city.  At 8 o'clock in the evening they left Ogden on the Union Pacific train which reached here this evening.</p>
                            <p>To-day Mr. Wattles and his traveling companions will be received by the governor at the State Capitol building, when they expect to meet all the state officers who are in the city and confer on the matter they are engaged in forwarding.  Later a visit will be paid to Mayor McMurray's office, and the remainder of the day is to be devoted to visiting the Chamber of Commerce, Mining Exchanges and other business institutions.</p>
                            <p>This evening most of the delegates are to take a train for Cripple Creek, returning here next day, and at 10:30 Friday night the journey Eastward will be resumed.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The advance guard of what promises to be the most stupendous and successful exposition ever held in the West arrived in Denver last evening.  A special Pullman car brought to the city ten of the most prominent business and financial men of Omaha, who came to tell the people of Colorado what Omaha intends to in 1898, when the Transmississippi and International exposition will be held in that city.  The party was made up as follows: Gurdon W. Wattles, president of the exposition corporation and vice president of the Union National bank; John W. Wakefield, secretary of the exposition and a wholesale lumber dealer; W. R. Bennett, president of Bennett &amp; Co., department store; John H. Evans, president of the National Bank of Commerce; Charles Metz, general manager of Metz Bros'. Brewing company; Henry A. Thompson of Thompson, Belden &amp; Co., dry goods merchants; Gilbert M. Hitchcock, owner and publisher of the Omaha World-Herald, and well-known champion of the silver cause; Zachary T. Lindsey, wholesale rubber goods; H. E. Palmer of the Omaha board of fire and police commissioners, and A. S. Hazleton, city attorney of Council Bluffs, Iowa.  The party was taken to the Brown Palace hotel, and there received by a number of prominent citizens of Denver.</p>
                            <p>The party and the objects of the trip are best explained in the words of President Wattles:  "We came for the purpose of feeling the pulse of the leading citizens of the transmississippi states regarding the coming exposition, which will be held at Omaha in 1898, and to try to encourage the people of Colorado to take early steps in the matter of getting up a suitable display for the affair.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Chance of a Life Time.</head>
                            <p>"The exposition was originally proposed at the transmississippi congress at its last session last November.  A resolution was introduced at that congress at its last session last November.  A resolution was introduced at that congress, at first as a sort of feeler among the delegates, and it took like wildfire.  It was appreciated that it was the opportunity of a lifetime, and that, as the West had been neglected heretofore by congress in the matter of recognition of international expositions, it would be appropriate to hold one west of the river.  Then the most appropriate place was a question.  Omaha was selected because it was thought that more people could be <choice><sic>goten</sic><corr>gotten</corr></choice> there than further west.</p>
                            <p>"What we want to do now is to stir up enthusiasm so that congress will give official recognition to the exposition and contribute $200,000 toward providing for a government exhibit.  Every section of the country has been recognized in this manner with the exception of the West.  Philadelphia, New Orleans, Chicago and Atlanta have all received millions in appropriations, with the exception of the latter, where $200,000 was donated, and I believe it is time for the West to get its share of the attention of the world.  I believe that the exposition at Omaha will stem the tide of investment and immigration which the East and South are receiving, and turn it toward the comparatively neglected transmississippi states.  As a result of the exposition at Atlanta, more than from any other cause, the immigration which is now setting toward the Southern states is due and the exposition at Omaha will be held just at the right time to catch the flood when it is at high tide in the South.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Spontaneous Excursion.</head>
                            <p>"Our party left Omaha last Friday evening.  It was hastily gotten together, mainly by telephone and there was a spontaneous response when the business men were asked to lay down their tools and go out to spread the tidings for the exposition.  Our first stop was at Cheyenne, where we met the prominent business men and the governor and state officials and they all assured us of their hearty support, and announced that they would do all in their power to have an appropriation made by the legislature.  The support of Wyoming was pledged to the exposition.  Salt lake was reached Sunday evening, and Monday morning we held a conference with the three presidents of the Mormon church.  George Q. Cannon, one of the presidents, was a member of the convention when the resolution to hold the exposition was passed, and he was an ardent supporter of the project.  The enthusiastic support of the church and also of the officials individually was pledged and it was announced that a liberal appropriation would be made for an exhibit.  During the afternoon we met the governor and special committees from both houses of the legislature, which is in session, and we were assured of their hearty support also.  Everyone expressed a lively interest in the exposition and gave us grand encouragement.</p>
                            <p>"To-morrow we will call on the governor and state officials and city and county officers and also the commercial organizations and endeavor to interest them by placing our plans open for their inspection.  To-night some of the party will leave for the mining camps and others will remain and visit Omaha friends who are now in Denver, and we will leave for home to-morrow night.</p>
                            <p>"I might add that the progress which has been made toward the exposition has been very encouraging.  Iowa has promised a liberal appropriation and a bill is now before congress asking for national recognition and an appropriation of $200,000 for a government exhibit."</p>
                            <p>Gilbert M. Hitchcock, owner and publisher of the World-Herald, who is one of the party, is enthusiastic regarding the outlook for the affair.  "I believe," he said last night, "that it will be a gigantic X-ray to reveal to investors of the world, and everybody who attends, the heretofore hidden resources not only of Colorado but of all the other comparatively neglected territory west of the river.  It will command the attention of everybody and will throw the flood of business and immigration West instead of South.  There is no rivalry between Colorado and Nebraska to detract from the affair.  What Colorado wants we can't expect to get, and while we have mutual interests we are not rivals.  Colorado has everything to gain by being properly represented, and I believe she will be."</p>

                            <p>Colorado will have an opportunity to open the eyes of the world to her boundless resources and the leading business men of Denver are going to grasp the opportunity with a vim and vigor that presage success from the start.  The opportunity is to be offered at the proposed Transmississippi exposition which is to be held in Omaha, Neb., from July to November, 1898.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha delegation of prominent business men representing the proposed exposition met President Steele and the members of the board of directors of the chamber of commerce in the commerce building last evening.</p>
                            <p>President Steele in calling the meeting to order expressed regret at the fact that he had received no notice officially until a few hours before the meeting was to be held; otherwise he would have called a meeting of the entire chamber.

                            <head type="sub">President Wattles' Address.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles, at the head of the visiting delegation, was the first speaker for the visitors.  He is a slim man, of middle age, and of pleasing address.  He said that the proposed Transmississippi exposition was an enterprise which originated at the last meeting of the Transmississippi congress at St. Louis.  That congress had of its own accord selected Omaha as the place for holding the exposition, and the contract was therefore thrust upon Omaha without her asking for it.  But since Omaha had been given the contract to fulfill she was determined to fulfill it if enterprise and energy and ambition could do so.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles dwelt upon the vast resources of the West, and said that this exposition was to be held to display them particularly.  Colorado, Utah and Wyoming were the neighbors of Nebraska, and the delegation came to ask them to aid in making the exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>Editor Hitchcock is a young man, an athlete in appearance, with black hair, dark complexion, smooth face and wears gold-rimmed eye-glasses.  He looks like a fighter&#8212;a man with a stiff backbone.  And that's what he is.  He has been fighting some red-hot battles for free silver at 16 to 1 in his paper, and has given every gold bug within reach a number of right-hand upper-cuts with his editorial quill.  So, Editor Hitchcock had no more than said, "Mr. President and gentlemen" than he put in a few good "sockdolagers" for free silver and everybody applauded.  He good naturedly remarked that the unregenerated bankers who were with him were having their eyes opened since they came to Colorado, and they were in imminent danger of being converted to the silver cause before getting back to Omaha.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Energy of the South.</head>
                            <p>Then Mr. Hitchcock made a forcible speech in favor of the proposed exposition.  He said the South had displayed nerve and energy in giving a most successful exposition which had just closed at Atlanta, and which had displayed the resources of the Southern section of the country; the East had given the Centennial, from which the East was benefited by immigration, but the West had never given a purely instructive Western exposition.  The World's fair was weighted down with a multiplicity of interests, and the West did not derive the benefit from its exhibits there that it would derive from a distinctively Western exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock said that Omaha proposed to go down into her pockets and defray all expenses for all preliminary work in an executive and operative way up to the time of opening the gates, but she knew that the exposition could not be made a success unless it was given the support of Colorado, Utah and other states west of the Missouri river.  He said the committee had visited Cheyenne and Utah and had received assurance of liberal support on every hand.  At Salt Lake the committee was cordially greeted by Hon. George Q. Cannon, President Woodruff of the Mormon church, and the governor of the state and other leading citizens.  While the visitors were there the Utah legislature passed a resolution unanimously in favor of having Utah represented at the exposition.  Also the Iowa legislature had passed a resolution commending the enterprise, and a bill had been introduced to appropriate $50,000 to construct a building for the Iowa exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock informed the board that a bill is now before congress asking for an appropriation of $250,000 to aid the exposition <unclear reason="covered"/> bill had already been reported on <unclear reason="covered"/> by the senate committee before <unclear reason="covered"/> was placed for consideration.  He <unclear reason="covered"/> the leading men of Colorado <unclear reason="covered"/>ask their representatives in congress <unclear reason="covered"/>ll they could in support of the bill.</p>
                            <p><unclear reason="covered"/> said that all Omaha asked was for Colorado to bring an exhibit of her illimitable resources to the show.  If the Western states would only stand together and make this show a success, they could tempt the homeseeker and attract the investor.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Acceptance by Colorado.</head>
                            <p>E. B. Coe, director of the Denver chamber of commerce, made a happy speech, which put everybody in good humor.  He said that Denver felt irritated somewhat because the exposition was not to be held here, but Denver didn't deserve to have it, because she had not been wide awake.  He admired the nerve and energy of the Omaha men, who, when they found the contract of getting up this exposition thrust upon them, went to work in the midst of a panic and raised $100,000 for the prosecution of the preliminary work.  He assured the visitors that Colorado would go to the show with the best exhibit that would be there.  While Nebraska had nothing more than hogs and corn and hominy to exhibit, yet Colorado would come in with gold, silver, lead, zinc and all known minerals, and then send fruits and agricultural products of rare perfection, and prove that Colorado, contrary to the general impression, is even greater in agricultural than in mineral wealth.  In fact, Colorado would be the star exhibitor at the show.  The homeseeker and the investor would come from the East to Omaha to visit the show and then they would come on out to Colorado to settle, "where the stuff comes from."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Coe paid Editor Hitchcock a flattering compliment for the good work he had been doing for free silver, and expressed regret that some formal appreciation could not be shown before he leaves.</p>

                            <p>Captain Palmer is a gray-haired pioneer, who was chief of staff for General P. E. Connor, commander of the district of the plains in 1865.  The captain told about his experience in Denver thirty-six years ago, when flour was selling for $15 per barrel, and a biscuit was worth more than a silver dollar now; when it cost 35 cents to mail a letter to one's wife or sweetheart in the East, and the only whisky to be had was of a Mexican brand, with sixteen fights to the cubic inch.  The captain hoped that Colorado would come to the Omaha exposition with a grand exhibit, and show the world the progress she had made since those pioneer days, and show the wonderful opportunity there is for still further development of her resources.</p>
                            <p>William G. Evans of Denver spoke in a praiseworthy way of the transmississippi exposition, and said there was no doubt but that Colorado would be represented in it.</p>
                            <p>A. S. Hazleton of Council Bluffs, Ia., who accompanied the Omaha delegation, told what his state was doing to aid the exposition, and expressed his views on the great benefit the West would derive from such an enterprise.</p>
                            <p>Robert W. Speer said that if a local committee were appointed to push the matter, he thought Colorado would come to the front all right.</p>
                            <p>The meeting ended with the general good feeling of a love feast.  Captain Palmer and Editor Hitchcock will return home this morning.  The other members of the delegation went to Cripple Creek last night to spend one day in that great gold camp.</p>

                            <p>The Omaha visitors waited upon Mayor McMurray yesterday.  As soon as the arrival of the distinguished party was known about the city hall, the mayor's offices were filled with other officials.  Lieutenant-Governor Jud Brush happened to be calling upon the mayor, and assured the delegation that Colorado would assist in all possible ways to make the Omaha exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles of the exposition committee said that the help of the Centennial state was desired especially to secure national recognition and appropriation from Congress for the enterprise.  He declared that it was time the West, comprising two-thirds of the territory of the country, begun to as<unclear reason="cut off"/> the place to which it was entitled <unclear reason="cut off"/> to insist upon proper recognition <unclear reason="cut off"/> claims.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock, editor and proprietor of the World-Herald of Omaha spoke of the splendid firm, Colorado <unclear reason="cut off"/> Nebraska, the first the mineral trea<unclear reason="cut off"/> of the country and the world, the <unclear reason="cut off"/> destined to be the <choice><sic>granery</sic><corr>granary</corr></choice> of the <unclear reason="cut off"/>tinent.</p>
                            <p>Mayor McMurray said that the c<unclear reason="cut off"/> Denver would extend heartiest co-operation, and that the debt, if it could be considered such, should be without int<unclear reason="cut off"/> barring a friendly return in 1903, <unclear reason="cut off"/> the anniversary of the Louisiana purchase would doubtless be appropr<unclear reason="cut off"/> celebrated in this city.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield said that the <unclear reason="cut off"/>tical help needed was in pushing the <unclear reason="cut off"/> now pending in congress, recognizing the exposition and making an appropriation in its aid.</p>
                            <p><choice><sic>Presdent</sic><corr>President</corr></choice> Wattles was introduced <unclear reason="cut off"/> brokers of the mining exchange <unclear reason="cut off"/> morning, and made a brief address <unclear reason="cut off"/>plaining the objects of the proposed exposition and asking the to take <unclear reason="cut off"/>action in reference to it.  He was accompanied by his delegation from Omaha and all were greatly surprised and pleased at the interest shown in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>President Steele brought the exposition matter before the meeting of the board of directors of the chamber<unclear reason="cut off"/> night.  The board adopted a resolution to ask the Colorado senators and representatives to support the bill now <unclear reason="cut off"/> congress, asking for an appropriation <unclear reason="cut off"/> the transmississippi exposition.  The <unclear reason="cut off"/> also resolved to ask the next Colorado legislature to appropriate a sufficien<unclear reason="cut off"/> of money to defray the expenses of a<unclear reason="cut off"/> exhibit at Omaha.</p>

                            <p>The Omaha delegation now in this city in the interest of the Transmississippi exposition to be held in 1898, should meet with encouragement.  The gentlemen composing the delegation are making a tour of the West in order to awaken interest in the project and to arrange the preliminary steps for an exhibit from this state and the co-operation of Denver and all Colorado in the enterprise.  At Salt Lake City and elsewhere they have met with cordial receptions, and the same is due them at the hands of the people of Denver.</p>
                            <p>From the start of this exposition project it has had the hearty approval of The News.  It was discussed an indorsed at the last session of the Transmississippi congress, and Omaha has gone at it in a hearty and business-like manner.  A local organization has been formed, and upon the board of vice presidents will be representatives from each of the transmississippi states and tributaries.  A bill is pending in congress to give it aid and recognition, and all that is necessary to render it a magnificent success will be the cordial co-operation of all the states in whose interest the exposition will be held.</p>
                            <p>Among all these states and territories there is none that is the peer of Colorado in variety of resources or in industrial wealth and development.  This eminence, when the time comes, must be made clear by an exhibit which it will be impossible to surpass and which will demonstrate her claim as chief of the Rocky Mountain states.  The exposition is still two years away, but it is not too soon to begin to lay plans for Colorado's part in rendering it a success.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The influential delegation of business men who arrived here on Wednesday night from Omaha to arouse interest in the forthcoming Transmississippi Exposition to be held in that city in 1898, captured Denver and a portion of the state yesterday and left last night&#8212;the greater portion for Cripple Creek, the balance for home.</p>
                            <p>They had interviews with the representatives of the city, county and state governments, the Chamber of Commerce and Colorado Mining Exchange, and with the representative private citizens, and in each and every instance were given the most cordial assurances of co-operation and support.  The local people were almost as well informed regarding the benefits that would accrue to the city and state by such an exposition as is outlined, as the visitors and everything possible will be done to further the objects in view.</p>
                            <p>The delegation was very well satisfied with the result of the visit to Denver and to the other places touched at in the West.  G. M. Hitchcock, editor and proprietor of the Omaha World-Herald, and Capt. Palmer of the delegation returned home last night on account of business engagements, while the other eight went to the gold field for a short visit.</p>
                            <p>The party visited the Colorado Mining Stock Exchange during the call and were introduced to the brokers by President Root.  Gurdon W. Wattles president of the association made a brief speech, setting forth the objects of the visit to Denver.  He dwelt upon the great benefits that will result to Denver from the exposition and urged his hearers to join heartily in the efforts of Omaha to make the exposition the most important affair that has ever occurred west of the Mississippi river.  President Root made a short speech on the same lines after which a resolution was adopted pledging the exchange to give all the assistance in its power to the enterprise.</p>

                            <p>The delegation called at the city hall in the forenoon and met all the officers and heads of departments.  A meeting was held in the mayor's office at which the visitors, the city officials and Lieut. Gov. Brush, who happened to be in the building, were present.</p>
                            <p>Mayor McMurray, on behalf of Denver, extended a welcome to the party, and the lieutenant governor assured them that Colorado was in sympathy with the movement which had brought them here.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles of the exposition company stated the objects of the visitors.  They desired the co-operation and the support of the West, first, in the endeavor to secure national government recognition and, second, in exhibits to the exposition.  He believed the exposition would do a great deal to develop the West, as it was intended to be a Transmississippi affair and not local.  He knew of no city that could aid as much as Denver, which was recognized everywhere for its enterprise and push.  Mr. Hitchcock of the Omaha World-Herald also paid a neat compliment to Denver and the state and he believed that a partnership between Colorado and Nebraska was desirable and natural.  The one was the mineral state of the world and the other was going to be the <choice><sic>granery</sic><corr>granary</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>Mayor McMurray assured the party that whatever could be done by Denver and its citizens to aid the enterprise would be done.  What Colorado would do to Omaha in this matter would be reciprocated in 1903, when a celebration of the Louisiana purchase would be held.  Lieut. Gov. Brush spoke briefly and in the same strain.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wakefield, the secretary of the delegation, stated what in the opinion of Omaha and those interested in the exposition would be the most substantial bid that could be rendered.  If resolutions could be adopted by cities, counties and state in indorsement and if the representatives in the United States Congress were called on to support a liberal grant from the government, they would be most effectual.</p>
                            <p>Before taking their leave the distinguished visitors were again assured that everything possible would be done to assist in the laudable effort to benefit the West.</p>

                            <head type="sub">At the Governor's Office.</head>
                            <p>At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the delegation paid a visit to Gov. McIntire.  Other state officials had been called in for the occasion and there were present besides the governor, Secretary of State McGaffey, Treasurer Mulnix, Auditor Parks and Attorney General Carr.  The gentlemen from Omaha were welcomed in the governor's large reception room and there, after greetings, they stated their object in coming to Denver at this time.  President Wattles of the exposition association talked at some length of the aims of the people of Omaha in getting up an exposition.  It was, he said, not to be a show for Omaha's benefit only but an opportunity for the entire West to display its products and attract attention to its great resources and latent wealth.  It was hoped that every state west of the Mississippi would take an active part in the exposition.  Colorado, Mr. Wattles felt sure, would not be behind the others in this regard.  He hoped to see a valuable exhibit from this state, buildings suited to the occasion and the greatness of the state and an attendance of people equally as indicative of the energy of the people of Colorado.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Markel, Mr. Kountze and others of the delegation added a few words to what Mr. Wattles had said.  Gov. McIntire, in replying, said that he felt confident that the people of his state would not be backward or cold in this enterprise but would consider the opportunity a good one to get to the fore with an exhibit showing the greatness of their resources and growing wealth.  He could not officially promise anything except that in his message to the next Legislature he would recommend a suitable appropriation for the erection of buildings at the exposition and for the gathering together and presentation of a fine exhibit of Colorado products.</p>
                            <p>After this exchange of courtesies the guests were escorted through the corridors and apartments of the capitol, departing then to visit other officials.</p>

                            <p>Had it been known in time that Mr. Hitchcock was a member of the delegation a public reception would have been tendered him in recognition of the splendid educational services rendered by him and his newspaper to the cause of bimetallism.</p>
                            <p>The Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce held a special meeting last evening to hear from the Omaha delegation and to assure them of their sympathy and hearty assistance in the undertaking.  There was a good attendance.  President Steele of the chamber briefly introduced the visitors and bespoke for them the consideration of the board.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles, the president of the Exposition company, spoke of what was intended to be done to make the exposition a success.  The national government had been asked to subscribe $250,000 for buildings and exhibits and it was the intention to make it not only a Transmississippi, but an international exposition.  He spoke of the remarkable undeveloped interests of the West which could be brought before the world through such an exposition.  Nebraska desired to enter into partnership with Colorado in the undertaking.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Benefits for Colorado.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock spoke in an entertaining manner of the visit to the West and its results.  He said he had been a 16 to 1 silver man for years and he took the monometallists in the delegation West to convert them, and he believed he had succeeded; at least he had not heard them say anything to the contrary since they had been in the state.  He believed the benefits to be derived by Colorado from the Omaha exposition would be greater than those derived from the World's Fair.  The East had an idea that Colorado produced nothing but silver.  It could open the eyes of many if it cared.</p>
                            <p>Capt. Palmer, another member of the delegation, and who was in Denver in the early days, spoke briefly.</p>
                            <p>W. G. Evans said the directors would no doubt take action to assure Omaha and Nebraska that Denver was heart and soul in the movement.</p>
                            <p>President Steele assured the delegation that the commercial interests of the city would be in line when the time arrived.</p>
                            <p>Earl B. Coe was called on and spoke in eloquent terms of the services rendered to the cause of silver by Mr. Hitchcock through his newspaper.  Other speeches were made by Robert W. Speer and A. S. Hazelton of Council Bluffs.</p>
                            <p>We are glad the gentlemen from Omaha who are trying to work up interest in the exposition proposed to be held in that city have made a visit to Colorado, and especially that they have come to Denver.  It has given them an opportunity to see what a truly beautiful city is, and they will be able to tell their friends in Omaha what a prosperous state looks like.  We are sure there will be a readiness on the part of Colorado people to help the exposition when the time comes to make exhibits, provided the enterprise is on a sufficiently large scale.  Of course it could not be expected that Colorado would exert itself to prepare an exhibit for a little county fair, but we understand that the intention is to make an exposition representative of the greater part of the transmississippi region.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, March 28.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The house committee on ways and means at its session this morning gave a hearing to Representative Mercer on the Omaha exposition bill.  Mr. Mercer went into full details of the proposed exposition, explained the advantages which would accrue to the western country generally from the holding of this exposition, and the unanimous endorsement by the surrounding states of the proposition.  He produced for the committee's inspection a number of documents in support of his assertions, and urged that the committee make a favorable report on his bill providing for the holding of the exposition.  After he had concluded his argument it was decided to refer the whole matter to the subcommittee on miscellaneous affairs, composed of Representative Grosvenor, Russell, Tawney, Crisp and Wheeler.  Mr. Mercer will push this committee as fast as he can, and hopes to get a favorable report from it in a short time.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mercer of Nebraska made his argument today before the full committee on ways and means of the house for the passage of his bill for a Trans-Mississippi International exposition to be held at Omaha.  At its conclusion the members of the committee discussed the merits of the bill.  The committee was inclined to report it favorably, but as it had not been formally examined and reported by a sub-committee, the report was delayed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dingley asked that it go to a sub-committee of which he is chairman.  Congressman Hopkins asked that it go to the sub-committee of which he is chairman, but a compromise followed, and it was sent to sub-committee No. 6, namely, Grosvenor, Crisp, Russell, Tawney, and Wheeler, all of whom are favorable to it, and fast friends of Mr. Mercer.  Mr. Mercer called on General Grosvenor at his hotel, and requested that immediate action be taken by the sub-committee on the bill, as the whole committee will meet again on Wednesday.  The general assured Mr. Mercer that the sub-committee would meet and report the bill on Wednesday.  Chairman Dingley of the committee is opposed to the bill, but a large majority of the committee have pledged themselves to Mercer for the support of the bill.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles of the Transmississippi Exposition association has been busy since his return from his trip, in conjunction with the delegation of Omaha business men to Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, in the interest of the exposition project.  He has been working hard to catch up with the correspondence and other matters that had accumulated during his absence.</p>
                            <p>In company with a number of other men interested in the enterprise, he called upon Senator Thurston yesterday to urge him to exert himself for the prompt passage of the exposition bill in both house and senate.  The situation was carefully canvassed, and the new phase created by the submission of the house bill to a subcommittee of the ways and means committee, discussed.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston assured the delegation that General Grosvenor of Ohio, who is at the head of the subcommittee in question is a warm, personal friend, and expresses confidence in his support of the exposition measure.  In order to expedite action by the subcommittee, if possible, Senator Thurston wired General Grosvenor, asking his earnest and prompt approval of the exposition measure, and before night received the following reply:</p>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, D. C., March 29.&#8212;Hon. John M. Thurston, Omaha Neb.: Your bill just came to my subcommittee.  It shall have my earnest and persistent support; will consider it tomorrow.</p>

Each spoke enthusiastically of the success that attended their efforts and the manner in which they were received by the business men in all of the cities along the route.  A number of the business men of the city met the numbers at the train.</p>
                            <p>John A. Wakefield, in speaking of the trip, said:  "The first city we visited was Cheyenne.  We had given out no notice of our coming, with the exception of what had been stated in the newspapers, but found a large committee of officials and citizens waiting for us at the depot.  Among them was Mayor Merrill and Governor Richards and a number of the state officers.  After leaving the hotel we visited the capital building, and in the rooms of the governor a number of our delegation outlined the object of our visit.  All those present gave their approval to the project and pledged individual aid to its successful execution.  The mayor called a special meeting of the city council, at which a number of our city council, at which a number of our party again spoke of the exposition, and the project met with the council's hearty approval.  It endorsed it and agreed to distribute literature on the subject left, and use its utmost influence to place the matter in the proper light before the leading merchants of the city.  From the officials that I talked to I learned that the majority of the residents of the state would heartily concur in the movement, because the Wyoming display at the World's fair had wrought incalculable benefits to the state in placing before the public its resources, which up to that time had not been suspected by eastern investors.  Wyoming, when called upon for an exhibit at the Chicago exposition, was first among all the states of the union to respond.</p>

                            <head type="sub">OMAHA JUST THE PLACE.</head>
                            <p>"In canvassing among the citizens I learned that Omaha was regarded in a kindly light by them as being the gateway of the great west and that the location was the best for showing western products, as Omaha stands midway between the eastern and western commercial empires.  At the time of the World's fair there were no corporations of great magnitude in the state outside of the coal companies, but at the present time almost all products were represented by large firms, which would display large exhibits.</p>
                            <p>"We were treated royally by the Cheyenne people, who showed the regard in which they held the Nebraska metropolis.  We were driven to Fort Russell and taken to all the points of interest around the city.</p>
                            <p>"At Salt Lake we met representatives of the Mormon interests, among whom was Mr. Smith, who was one of the delegates to the Transmississippi congress that convened in this city last November.  Mr. Smith was one of the parties who used his influence at the convention in securing the location of the exposition in this city and rendered us valuable assistance in laying our plans before the proper officials.  Governor Wells was seen and stated that when the project was properly placed before the people of the state their support was, he thought, a foregone conclusion.  The inhabitants of the famous Salt Lake region, he said, were justly proud of their fertile valleys, in which almost every product known to the world was raised and they were always anxious for the opportunity to display them.  He felt warranted in promising that Utah would have an exhibit second to none at the great exposition.</p>

                            <p>"In the evening we met a delegation from the legislature in the county building.  It was addressed by Mr. Wattles, Mr. Hitchcock, Z. T. Lindsey and Captain Palmer.  The warm reception the subject received was <unclear reason="covered"/> a repetition of that accorded us at Cheyenne.  The committees pledged us their unanimous support.  In the afternoon of the same day we were taken on a short excursion to Saltair, a resort on the lake, and were shown through the mammoth pavilion coasting $250,000, erected by the wealthy Mormons of Salt Lake, and upon our return were driven around the city.</p>
                            <p>"On our return trip we stopped for three hours at Ogden and took our dinner at the hotel.  We were met by the mayor and a committee of citizens and discussed the subject while at the hotel.  All were in favor of the exposition and considered Omaha the proper place for it.</p>
                            <p>"At Denver we were met by Mayor McMurray, Lieutenant Governor Brush and a large number of city and county officials.  Many of these parties formerly lived in Omaha and readily promised to show their interest in the welfare of the city by lending their aid in booming the project to the utmost.  Mayor McMurray pledged the assistance of the city and state and promised that the Colorado exhibit would outshine all others.  He, however, stipulated that the support of the Denver people should be given on condition that Omaha would return the favor when the exposition commemorating the purchase of the Louisiana tract took place in Denver in 1903.</p>
                            <p>"In the afternoon we met Governor McIntyre and the state officials at the capitol building.  All pledged the state for an extensive exhibit.  We then visited the Mining exchange, where the operators stopped transactions while Mr. Wattles addressed them.  A motion was put at the completion of his speech that the directors be instructed to frame resolutions in favor of the exposition, and that they forward the same to the representatives in congress.  In the evening we met the members of the Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce, at which Captain Palmer, G. W. Wattles, G. M. Hitchcock and A. S. Hazleton spoke.  The two bodies adopted resolutions endorsing the exposition and directed that they be forwarded to the representatives in Washington.</p>
                            <p>"Of our return trip from Denver little is to be said.  We stopped over for a few hours at Cripple Creek and were shown through the upper works of the Independence mine and driven around the town.  We met many Omaha people there, who seem to be conducting prosperous establishments.  I can only say in conclusion that the excursion was a most prosperous one and productive of great benefit to the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">TRYING TO SHIFT HIS RESPONSIBILITY.</head>
                            <p>When a man wants to pick a quarrel he seldom has any trouble in finding a pretext.  In his peerless effort at self-laudation, made last Tuesday at the Boyd theater McKinley rally, Senator Thurston went out of his way to charge the newspapers of this city and the business men actively interested in the Transmississippi exposition with undertaking to trade off Nebraska presidential support for congressional support of the exposition bill.  This charge was emphasized by the senator in the following insulting language:</p>
                            <p>If these self-constituted traffickers in presidential support had kept entirely out of this matter, the exposition bill would have gone through congress with the greatest of ease, and without any opposition.  I do not make this statement idly; I know whereof I speak, and I add, kindly but firmly, that if these same newspapers had devoted one-half of the effort in sustaining and upholding their senator that they have in attempting to discredit him before the country and congress, their exposition bill would have been much more certain of success than it is under the present conditions, which they have heedlessly and unnecessarily created.</p>
                            <p>These uncalled for and baseless aspersions have been supplemented with an open letter over the signature of John M. Thurston printed in the World-Herald, in which the senator disclaims any reference to that paper, but singles out The Bee for his reprimand as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Omaha Bee is the only paper which has assumed to hold out presidential support in exchange for congressional and state support for our exposition.</p>
                            <p>Tom Reed and Senator Allison are both too broad and honorable to think of holding up our bill in congress because of any effort made by me or anyone else to secure delegates who would voice the sentiment of Nebraska republicans in favor of McKinley.</p>
                            <p>The danger is, however, that The Bee and some of the exposition managers have held out unwarranted inducements to the friends of Allison and Reed and have been asserting that my opposition was all that stood in the way of the favorite son plan, in the success of which they were supposed to have so much interest.  I say again that this unwarranted attempt to exchange presidential support for exposition support is all that has endangered the exposition bill.</p>
                            <p>The senator comes about as near the truth in these assertions as he did in his dramatic declamations railing at bosses, politicians and railroad magnates.  If he knows whereof he speaks, as he says he does, let him produce his proofs or retract his charges.  There has been no attempt whatever to barter away Nebraska's presidential vote, unless the rumor is true that a cabinet place is to be held in reserve for the man who delivers the Nebraska delegation to William McKinley.  We challenge the senator to point to a line in The Bee to substantiate his allegation.  The Bee has never said one word derogatory to McKinley.  On the contrary, it has said more in his favor than in favor of all other candidates combined, including General Manderson.</p>
                            <p>The efforts of The Bee and those of the exposition managers have been exerted solely with the view of enlisting the good will and assistance of senators and congressmen who are in position to expedite or retard the passage of the exposition bill.  Instead of holding out promises of presidential support from Nebraska, as the senator alleges, appeals for support have sought to dissipate expectation of political reciprocity.  In proof of this, Senator Thurston's attention is invited to the following response from Senator Chandler to a letter invoking his influence in behalf of the exposition with Chairman Dingley of the house committee on ways and means:</p>
                            
                            <pb n="78" xml:id="TMISB01-078"/>
                            
                            <p>WASHINGTON, March 20, 1896.&#8212;Dear Sir: Your letter is at hand.  I have not yet had time to talk with Mr. Dingley, but will do everything I can for the Transmississippi exposition, no matter who is president.  I believe a national, not international, exposition in the interior of the country will be <unclear reason="covered"/> helpful in all respects.  Truly yours,</p>
                            <l>WILLIAM E. CHANDLER.</l>
                            <ab><unclear reason="covered"/>E. Rosewater, Esp.</ab>
                            <p>If Senator Thurston is to be believed, the exposition bill would have passed long ago had it not been for the interference of The Bee and the Omaha business men, who are laboring for its success.  While this is a very flattering imputation as to the influence of The Bee at Washington, it is also a humiliating confession on the part of the senator.  Had his open letter been dated from his post of duty at Washington instead of from political headquarters at Omaha it might have afforded some sort of excuse for the delay in securing senatorial action on the bill.  The trouble with Senator Thurston is that he is trying to shift the responsibility and appears to be totally oblivious of the relations to the public imposed upon him by his official position.  He seems to have forgotten that the first duty of a senator is to the people of his state whose interests should not be sacrificed to personal ambition or political glory.  The senator's maiden speech has been duly delivered, but his maiden bill is yet to be passed.</p>
                            <p>Fine words butter no parsnips.  The people of Omaha and Nebraska prefer substantial results to presidential rainbow chasing.  They are asking themselves, What is Nebraska's only republican senator doing in Nebraska when measures of state and national concern are awaiting the action of congress in session at Washington?  They applaud him when he says he trusts the people.  But they cannot comprehend why he refuses to trust the people to select their own delegates to the national convention.  Neither can they comprehend why he should loiter at home after he has secured all the political honor that he demanded in his recent ultimatum.</p>
                            <p>Nobody regrets more than The Bee does to be forced to use such plain language or to be driven into a controversy which cannot but be annoying to all concerned.  The blame must rest where it belongs.  There was no occasion for the arraignment of any paper or any man for laboring zealously to promote the Transmississippi exposition project.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SENATOR THURSTON'S MISTAKE.</head>
                            <p>Public men, no matter how gifted, are liable to be indiscreet.  Henry Clay, the most popular orator America ever produced, once wrote a letter that lost him the presidency.  James G. Blaine failed of his life's ambition because he accepted an invitation to dine with the Wall street nabobs at a gold plate dinner.  These historic incidents should have suggested themselves to Senator Thurston before he ventured upon the course which he is pursuing in the present presidential campaign.  Senator Thurston has a host of enthusiastic admirers, but this man worship should not be misconstrued or abused.  Like every other public man the senator has a right to champion his preferred candidate in any legitimate way, provided always that in so doing he does not neglect his officials duties to the public and does not arrogate to himself the privileges and prerogatives that belong under a republican form of government to the rank and file of the party.</p>
                            <p>No exception can be taken to Senator Thurston's efforts to promote the candidacy of ex-Governor McKinley through the medium of the press or from the platform and banqueting board.  It was also his privilege to define his position fully before the republican state committee as to the respective claims of rival candidates.  The assurance which the senator gave on that occasion that he had no desire or disposition to dictate the course of Nebraska republicans either as to presidential preferences or delegates to the national convention was applauded and accepted in good faith by the party.  But the subsequent ultimatum promulgated from Washington over Senator Thurston's name naturally created surprise even among his friends.  Here was a peremptory command that he should be chosen as one of the delegates to St. Louis and that he should in addition name two of the delegates-at-large.</p>
                            <p>The return of the senator to Nebraska after he had publicly announced that he would not return, and that, too, after all his unprecedented demands had been conceded, and his utterances since his return, are not calculated to strengthen him in the public esteem.  The senator, in view of his own career, creates a suspicion of insincerity when he arraigns the politicians and denounces political bosses and railroad interference in politics.  His constituents ought to be credited with some intelligence.  And he further invites rebuke when he takes the business men and the newspapers of Omaha to task for their alleged attempts to barter presidential support for congressional support of the <choice><sic>Transmississppi</sic><corr>Transmississippi</corr></choice> exposition bill.  He goes so far as to ascribe his failure of the newspapers to sustain and uphold their senator and their attempts to discredit him before congress and the country.</p>
                            <p>This charge is not only puerile, but baseless.  The senator, like some other public men, seems to forget that no man is infallible.  He has been generously treated by the press and every effort made by him in behalf of his constituents has been commended.  He has no right to expect the press of Nebraska to be so servile as to play the hypocrite for any public man by praising views at variance with its honest sentiment.  Such a thing is unheard of in American politics in our day.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, the senator underrates the intelligence of his constituents when he seeks to make them believe that his inability to secure much-needed legislation is due to interference with his own plans with respect to the Nebraska delegation to St. Louis.  The business men actively interested in the Transmississippi exposition have endeavored so far as possible to divorce the enterprise completely from politics.  But Senator Thurston is too much of a politician not to know that legislatures and congresses are political bodies and people must not look for favors from men whom they antagonize.  If Senator Thurston had not projected himself so far into the front of the McKinley fight when there was no necessity for it, and had remained at his port of duty, he might have been more successful with the legislative measures desired by the people of Omaha and Nebraska.</p>

                            <p>The announcement of a mass meeting at Boyd's opera house last night in the interest of William McKinley was sufficient to draw a crowd which filled every seat on the lower door and balcony, while a large number of people were compelled to stand up during the opening.  The audience was composed largely of men, but many women were present.  The upper boxes on each side of the house were draped with national colors.</p>
                            <p>At the back of the stage Old Glory was draped in graceful folds, surrounding a portrait of William McKinley.

                            <p>At the conclusion of Mr. Wheeler's talk Senator Thurston appeared upon the stage and was greeted with a burst of applause.</p>
                            <p>The McKinley club double quartet was announced and sang a campaign song which pleased the audience immensely.</p>

                            <p>Senator Thurston was the chief, though the <unclear reason="folded"/>st, speaker.  He said:</p>
                            <p>"Much as I dislike to enter upon any personal statement, I find it necessary to briefly review the events which have led up to the present Nebraska situation with respect to the presidency.</p>
                            <p>"About the 6th of February General Manderson came to Washington, stopped at the same hotel with me, and we have daily pleasant, friendly conversations.  I left Washington on the evening of February 11, without the least idea that the political situation in my state had changed, or that there was any thought of General Manderson's candidacy.  As a matter of fact, however, at this same time certain of his friends were making all arrangements to have the candidacy announced through the state committee, which had been hastily called together by telegraph for a meeting on February 14.  I reached Omaha on the forenoon of that day, and learned for the first time that some sort of plan was on foot to have a declaration made in his favor by the state central committee that evening at Lincoln.  I also ascertained beyond all question or dispute that certain individuals in the city of Omaha, pretending to act in his interest, had been quietly but effectively engaged in the attempt to defeat my election as a delegate to the St. Louis convention.  I felt then and I feel now that any man who desires to announce himself as a candidate for the high office of president ought to consult the wishes and desires of the republicans of his state in the first instance, and without any intention of reflecting on any one, I am compelled to state as my solemn conviction that the unfortunate and deplorable political situation which has resulted is almost wholly due to the fact that the republicans of Nebraska, the rank and file of the party, were not in any manner taken into the confidence of those who had in charge Mr<unclear reason="covered"/> that almost every <unclear reason="covered"/>fied with that mo<unclear reason="covered"/> known as a friend <unclear reason="covered"/>Kinley, and that t<unclear reason="covered"/> sought to inaugurate <unclear reason="covered"/> directly calculated <unclear reason="covered"/> that their wishes <unclear reason="covered"/> that they were as <unclear reason="covered"/> previous conviction<unclear reason="covered"/>nouncement of the<unclear reason="covered"/></p>

I desire <unclear reason="covered"/>assert my belief <unclear reason="covered"/>cerity of his ca<unclear reason="covered"/>tunate for him, a<unclear reason="covered"/> of Nebraska, tha<unclear reason="covered"/> of his candidacy, <unclear reason="covered"/> impressed the p<unclear reason="covered"/> they were engaged <unclear reason="covered"/> the popular will <unclear reason="covered"/>ually concerned, <unclear reason="covered"/> deeply hurt&#8212;not<unclear reason="covered"/> that the candida<unclear reason="covered"/>acter, on the pa<unclear reason="covered"/> of my state, sh<unclear reason="covered"/> one suggestion of <unclear reason="covered"/> to my attention <unclear reason="covered"/> still feel, that <unclear reason="covered"/> friends of Will<unclear reason="covered"/> should have been <unclear reason="covered"/> this matter.  I <unclear reason="covered"/> it was due to my as the only <unclear reason="covered"/>acter from this state, that I should at least be notified of a purpose to change the entire political course of the party in my state from what I had been led to believe was in the hearts of the people themselves.  Had the McKinley men in Nebraska, including myself, ever been approached with the suggestion that our distinguished fellow citizen, Charles F. Manderson, desired to be presented by his state it is at least presumable that we would have been entirely willing to have given that suggestion favorable consideration, and that the presentation of Mr. Manderson's name to the national convention could have been agreed upon around the fireside of the republican party, under such conditions and accompanied by such announcement as would relieve his candidacy from any appearance of confederation with the political bosses, or of direct antagonism to the wish of our people, that William McKinley should be their next president.  There was not a moment from the time that General Manderson's candidacy was first thought of that his friends could not have secured, without contention or quarrel, from the supporters of William McKinley in Nebraska as favorable an arrangement with respect to the support of both candidates as has now been reached after these weeks of unfortunate contention.</p>

                            <p>"I regret more deeply than I can express those personal reflections which have been cast upon men and upon my course  by many of those who had direct charge of General Manderson's campaign.  So far as I cam individually concerned, I shall overlook and forget, and shall devote myself in every honorable way to the complete restoration of harmony in the republican party of this state.

                            <head type="sub"><unclear reason="covered"/>UND TO RAILROADS.</head>
                            <p><unclear reason="covered"/>word in a personal way.  In my address to the republicans of Nebraska, recently published, I referred to the representatives of a well understood political power in this state, that had advised me that it would be unsafe for my political power in this state, that had advised me that it would be unsafe for my political future to oppose the program which had been arranged at the meeting of the state central committee.  The Omaha World-Herald, referring to that, declared that I had been elected United States senator by that same well understood political power.  I state here and now, in the presence of all mankind, that I was not elected United States senator by any railroad company, or because of the fact that I had been for many years a railroad attorney, but I was elected in spite of the fact of the important position I had held with one of the great railway corporations of this country.  It is true that for many years I was at the head of the law department of the greatest railway system of the universe.  I went into the railway service a comparatively poor man, and I left the railway service a comparatively poor man.  Notwithstanding the many opportunities I might have taken advantage of for speculation, I never made or attempted to make one dollar except what came to me as my stated salary for services performed.  I have the proud satisfaction of knowing that my client never complained of me on account of any failure to do my whole duty for my client's interests.  While I was connected professionally with the railway company I devoted myself to its interests utterly, regardless as to whether or not what I did for my client might prejudice me in the public estimation.  I left the railway service without feeling myself obligated in the least degree, so far as any official action of mine may be concerned.  I recognize the fact that the great railway interests of this state are entitled to receive equal consideration by all public officials with similar interests of individual citizens.  I propose in the senate of the United States to deal fairly and justly with every interest in the state of Nebraska, corporate or otherwise, and I believe I have enough courage to do what I think is right for the corporations of this state, although I may at times bring upon myself the criticism and censure of my people.  I will do what is right by all corporations, not because they have any right to demand anything of me, but because I shall feel it a duty.  But I have never forgotten, and I never shall forget, that I am born of the plain people; I am the lineal descendant of eight generations of American farmers.  I was born to humble conditions and brought up in a life of toil.</p>

                            <p>"I believe I know the thoughts and hopes and aspirations and desires of the common people of this country.  I believe that I instinctively turn to them in all great matters affecting the public welfare, and I take this occasion to say, openly and publicly, in the face of the world, that if it comes at any time to an issue between the corporations and the people, if I am compelled to choose between the corporate demand <unclear reason="torn"/> and the wishes of the plain people <unclear reason="torn"/> other, then regardless of consequences <unclear reason="torn"/>out thought of result, for weal or <unclear reason="torn"/> cast my lot with the people.  It <unclear reason="torn"/> that I have entered upon the only <unclear reason="torn"/> term in public office I may ever be pa<unclear reason="torn"/> to hold&#8212;but while I am senator of the <unclear reason="torn"/> States, representing in that august b<unclear reason="torn"/> people of the state of Nebraska, I <unclear reason="torn"/> to do what I believe is for the w<unclear reason="torn"/> of my country, of my commonwealth, <unclear reason="torn"/> the people among whom I have pas<unclear reason="torn"/> many years of my life, and in the p<unclear reason="torn"/>ance of my duty as an American <unclear reason="torn"/> republican I will not be dictated to <unclear reason="torn"/> power, however great, by any combi<unclear reason="torn"/> however strong.</p>
                            <p>"One other matter of a somewhat p<unclear reason="torn"/> kind, which I desire to refer to.  The <unclear reason="torn"/> papers of this city and some of our b<unclear reason="torn"/> men who profess to be deeply interes<unclear reason="torn"/> the success of the Transmississippi <unclear reason="torn"/>tion have been endeavoring to mix <unclear reason="torn"/> presidential issue with the exposition <unclear reason="torn"/> congress, and have undertaken to tra<unclear reason="torn"/> Nebraska presidential support for co<unclear reason="torn"/>sional support of the Omaha bill.  If the self-constituted traffickers in presidentia<unclear reason="torn"/>port had kept entirely out of this m<unclear reason="torn"/> the exposition bill would have gone t<unclear reason="torn"/> congress with the greatest of ease, and <unclear reason="torn"/>out any opposition.  I do not make this <unclear reason="torn"/>ment idly; I know whereof I speak, <unclear reason="torn"/> add, kindly but firmly, that if these <unclear reason="torn"/> newspapers had devoted one-half of t<unclear reason="torn"/>fort in sustaining and upholding thei<unclear reason="torn"/>ator that they have in attempting t<unclear reason="torn"/>credit him before the country and co<unclear reason="torn"/> their exposition bill would have been <unclear reason="torn"/> more certain of success than it is und<unclear reason="torn"/> present conditions, which they have <unclear reason="torn"/>lessly and unnecessarily created.  I b<unclear reason="torn"/> however, that under the present turn <unclear reason="torn"/>fairs I shall go back to the senate a<unclear reason="torn"/> in a position to render a good account <unclear reason="torn"/> people of Omaha and Nebraska in thi<unclear reason="torn"/>ter of the establishment of the Tra<unclear reason="torn"/>sissippi exposition."</p>

                            <p>John C. Wharton was the first s<unclear reason="torn"/>  Referring to the fact that this ca<unclear reason="torn"/> was booming at a time when it had <unclear reason="torn"/> been thought too early for political <unclear reason="torn"/> he attributed the interest manifeste<unclear reason="torn"/> the fact that it grew out of a determin<unclear reason="torn"/> on the part of the people to throw off d<unclear reason="torn"/>cratic rule.  He drew a striking con<unclear reason="torn"/> between the prosperity under Harrison'<unclear reason="torn"/>ministration and the prostration of bu<unclear reason="torn"/> under Cleveland, and referred to Se<unclear reason="torn"/> Thurston as the Moses who was to lea<unclear reason="torn"/> people of Nebraska over the Red sea <unclear reason="torn"/>pression to the promised land.  In 186<unclear reason="torn"/> speaker said the people made an <unclear reason="torn"/>whelming demand for Lincoln's election <unclear reason="torn"/> in 1896 the cry was going up from a <unclear reason="torn"/>rections for McKinley as the embod<unclear reason="torn"/> of the principles and doctrines of the r<unclear reason="torn"/>lican party.</p>
                            <p>W. J. Connell said the people of O<unclear reason="torn"/> had met to add their share to the <unclear reason="torn"/> wave of popular sentiment which was s<unclear reason="torn"/>ing across the country in favor of Mc<unclear reason="torn"/>ley.  If any other man were nominated <unclear reason="torn"/> St. Louis, he said, the people of Nebraska would give him loyal support.  The <unclear reason="torn"/> and the republicans of Nebraska have <unclear reason="torn"/>creed, the speaker said, that the nam<unclear reason="torn"/> the next president shall begin with the letter "M," and it will be either McKinley or Manderson.  Mr. Connell said he wa<unclear reason="torn"/> ardent advocate of the principle of 16<unclear reason="torn"/> on the silver question, but was willi<unclear reason="torn"/> accept the amendment offered by Senator Thurston making the rule apply to the American product, but the McKinleyites had <unclear reason="torn"/> one better and had offered to make <unclear reason="torn"/> to nothing.</p>
                            <p>Joe F. Barton then appeared on t<unclear reason="torn"/> and struck a popular chord by s<unclear reason="torn"/> song written by I. W. Miner and s<unclear reason="torn"/> music of "Marching Through Georgia<unclear reason="torn"/> refrain was sung by the Glee club, <unclear reason="torn"/> by the audience.  It was:</p>

                            </lg>
                            <p>This song was enthusiastically cheered <unclear reason="torn"/> the last verse was repeated as an encore.</p>

                            <p>General John C. Cowlin was then introduced.  He said the heart of every old so<unclear reason="torn"/> in the audience was thrilled by the mus<unclear reason="torn"/> that stirring song, and he knew of no<unclear reason="torn"/> on whom the mantle of the noble She<unclear reason="torn"/> might better fall than on William McKinley.

The great mov<unclear reason="torn"/> which was sweeping over the country<unclear reason="torn"/> said, was not a mushroom growth fos<unclear reason="torn"/> by the politicians, but had its origin in<unclear reason="torn"/> homes of the workingmen, and it could <unclear reason="torn"/> be turned aside by the united efforts of <unclear reason="torn"/> political bosses.  He referred to McKin<unclear reason="torn"/> schooling during the war in the principl<unclear reason="torn"/> patriotism, and said that McKinley's <unclear reason="torn"/> object since the war was to elevate the <unclear reason="torn"/>dition of the masses.  He then read from <unclear reason="torn"/> newspaper clipping a report of a schem<unclear reason="torn"/> the part of certain members of the nat<unclear reason="torn"/> republican committee to defeat the no<unclear reason="torn"/>tion of McKinley by organizing the co<unclear reason="torn"/>tion with delegates unfavorable to the <unclear reason="torn"/> man, and said that Senator Thurston <unclear reason="torn"/> do no better than to be clothed with <unclear reason="torn"/> power to go to that convention and <unclear reason="torn"/> with the promoters of his scheme.

                            <p>Omaha, March 28.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: I find on careful examination of World-Herald files that I did your paper an injustice in stating that "the newspapers of Omaha" had been mixing up the exposition matter with the republican presidential question.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha Bee is the only paper which has assumed to hold out presidential support in exchange for congressional and state support for our exposition.</p>
                            <p>Tom Reed and Senator Allison are both too broad and honorable to think of holding up our bill in congress because of any effort made by me or anyone else to secure delegates who would voice the sentiment of Nebraska republicans in favor of McKinley.</p>
                            <p>The danger is, however, that the Bee and some of the exposition managers have held out <choice><sic>unwarrainted</sic><corr>unwarranted</corr></choice> inducements to the friends of Allison and Reed and have been asserting that my opposition was all that stood in the way of the favorite son plan, in the success of which they were supposed to have so much interest.  I say again that this unwarranted attempt to exchange presidential support for exposition support is all that has endangered the exposition bill.  I feel in duty bound to exonerate the World-Herald from any participation in that.</p>
                            <p>So far as the McKinley-Manderson contest is concerned, I make no complaint, as you evidently published both sides, and it may be the opposition had as much to object to or even more than myself or friends.</p>
                            <p>I do not object to any criticism of any public action of a political character, and could not expect a free silver advocate to approve my position on the money question.  Outside of political differences I certainly hope to stand well with my home newspapers and do not wish to do any of them the least injustice.</p>

                            <head type="sub">A Project of Vast Importance to the Black Hills.</head>
                            <p>The Black Hills country, through its Improvement association or some other suitable organization, should at once take some steps to further the important enterprise known as the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, to be held in Omaha in the fall of 1898 and to make a strong and united effort to secure national and state appropriations.</p>
                            <p>Thomas H. Wells, of this city, who was recently appointed vice president of the exposition for the state of South Dakota, in response to a request from the World-Herald for his ideas regarding the exposition, says:</p>
                            <p>"I am proud to state that I was a member of the Trans-Mississippi congress, which held its last session in your hospitable city last November and had the pleasure of voting for the resolution then adopted by a unanimous vote of the congress, which is as follows:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway, where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these wealth producing states, but to all the home seekers of the world, therefore,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the United States congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September and October in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such states and territories in congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases, to assist in carrying out this enterprise.</p>
                            <p>I thought at that time, and think so yet, that such an exposition successfully carried out will so advertise our immense resources that we will be benefited in every way and our eastern neighbors will also be greatly benefited by being enabled to send thousands from their crowded cities to till the soil and delve into the earth for hidden wealth and become well-to-do stockmen instead of eking out a miserable existence in overcrowded labor markets of the east.</p>
                            <p>The 'idea' was a good one in every way and I trust that congress will do its duty by the great west, whose people are asking so little and promising so much.</p>
                            <p>I assure you that I will do all that I can to further the interests of the exposition and hope that it will culminate in a brilliant success."</p>

                            <p>It will be cold day for the trans-Mississippi exposition if Nebraska lends her influence or uses it to defeat Speaker Reed for the republican nomination for president.  The promoters are soliciting congressional aid in the form of an appropriation and if this be refused it will be a death blow to the enterprise.  As Mr. Reed is speaker and exercises great influence the importance of having his support is not to be discounted.  But how is his friendship to be gained and retained?  By supporting some other candidate?  Hardly.  Mr. Reed will not be slow to recognize the position taken by Nebraska.  If that state be for him Nebraska would have every reason to hope for his aid in the matter of obtaining an appropriation.  If it be against him Nebraska could not reasonably solicit favors at his hand, nor would it have any cause to complain if he exerted his influence against it.  Reciprocity is human, and so is revenge.  They are diametrical, yet distinct elements of human nature.  Reed is lacking in neither.  He is reciprocal and revengeful.  His right to trail personal questions into his official acts may be questioned, but that he is inclined that way no one can dispute.  Nebraska may with safety oppose Reed in the interests of Maderson, Allison or any western candidate, but if that state opposes him in the interest of McKinley, Morton or some other eastern man Mr. Reed will likely strike back, and would have a right to.  The business men of Nebraska ought not permit politicians to kill the trans-Mississippi enterprise.  If the exposition be a success it will be the making of Omaha.  It will greatly stimulate the commercial interests of that city, and will infuse new life into her various industries.  It will relieve Omaha and Nebraska of the burdens under which they have been staggering the last two years.  Omaha needs commercial relief more than any thing else.  She can well afford to sacrifice the political standing of professional politicians like Thurston, Webster and Connell to gain commercial prosperity.  Should the exposition prove a failure it would be a bitter and destructive blow, not alone to Omaha and Nebraska, but to the whole west.  Yes, Nebraska can consistently support Manderson or Allison, but when she crosses the Mississippi for a candidate she will best promote and subserve her own interests by extending her hand to Reed.</p>

                            <p>"We, your special committee, to whom was referred the communication of the Honorable Mayor Broatch of Omaha, Nebraska, beg leave to submit the following resolution and recommend its <choice><sic>adoptiol</sic><corr>adoption</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>"Whereas, It is intended to promote the common interest of the states and territories of the United State, lying west of the Mississippi river, by holding in the city of Omaha, state of Nebraska, during the year 1898, an exposition of the products, industries, arts and civilization of said region, to the end that its wonderful and diversified resources may become better known to mankind; and</p>
                            <p>"Whereas, Such exposition will afford to the people of Utah an opportunity to bring to the notice of the world, not only what they have accomplished by patience, persistence and toil in transforming a barren and desolate wilderness into a productive and prosperous state, but as well, knowledge of the marvellous diversity of the mineral resources which it possesses, the magnificence of its climate and the multitude of its attractions; and</p>
                            <p>"Whereas, It is most fitting that the people whose pioneers broke the first trail over the region to be illustrated in the exposition and first conveyed to civilization an account of its boundless undeveloped wealth, should be participants in said exposition; and</p>
                            <p>"Whereas, The state of Utah contains within its borders not only the best illustrations of the efficacy of irrigation in the redemption of our arid lands, but as well mines of almost every mineral known to mineralogy, knowledge of which ,if communicated to the world, will result in attracting to the state vast capital and a large additional population;</p>
                            <p>"Therefore, Be it resolved by the city council of Salt Lake city, that we are in hearty accord with the plan of holding at Omaha the said exposition; that we applaud the progressive spirit shown by the citizens of said city in entering into the work of bringing it about, and that we will lend our aid and encouragement to all efforts made by Utah citizens to secure for the state a creditable exhibit of the resources of the state at said exposition; and</p>
                            <p>"Be it further resolved, That our honorable senators, Messrs. Brown and Cannon and our other representative, Mr. Allen are hereby requested to assist and do all in their power to aid the city of Omaha in procuring the appropriation asked by them from congress; and</p>
                            <p>"The recorded is hereby instructed to send a copy of this report and resolution to the honorable Mayor Broatch of Omaha ,Nebraska, and to our honorable senators and representative."</p>

                            <p>WHEREAS, Nature in her benevolence has not favored any locality more highly than the Great Puget Sound Basin, in bringing together so many elements contributing to man's happiness and material welfare, under a sky, covering a perpetual sanitarium, and in a climate carrying throughout the year less discomfort than in any locality where energy contributes to thrift;and no

                            <p>The city of Council Bluffs officially recognized the proposed Transmississippi exposition last night and took action in the direction of the promotion of the project by asking the legislature of the state of Iowa to make an appropriation for a state exhibit at the exposition in Omaha in 1898.</p>
                            <p>Early in the history of the movement in favor of the exposition those who were urging the matter in Council Bluffs became imbued with the idea that the location of the exposition grounds was the most important feature of the show, so far as this city was concerned, and secured the adoption of resolutions declaring in favor of the location of the exposition at East Omaha and opposing an appropriation for an Iowa exhibit if the exposition were located elsewhere.  Investigation has made evident the fact that the particular site selected for the exposition is really of minor importance when compared with the immense benefits to be derived by Council Bluffs and Iowa from the successful consummation of the exposition idea and the city council adopted resolutions endorsing the idea and asking the state legislature to make an appropriation for the purpose of properly representing Iowa in the proposed exposition.</p>
                            <p>This action of the council was taken at a special meeting held last night.  There were present from Omaha, representing the Omaha directory of the exposition society, G. W. Wattles, John A. Wakefield, G. M. Hitchcock, Z. T. Lindsey, Dan Farrell and George H. Payne.  After the council had been called to order the resolution endorsing the project was read.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COMMITTEE WORK REVIEWED.</head>
                            <p>George F. Wright made a brief address, in which he reviewed the work of the committees that had been considering the propositions.  He said he had become impressed with the importance of the prestige that would be given the movement if the Iowa legislature should make an appropriation for an exhibition at the exposition and of the weight it would have in securing national recognition of the enterprise.  He was anxious that the council listen to the statements of the case by members of the Omaha directory, and called upon G. W. Wattles to address the council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wattles said that the exposition had been located in Omaha by the Transmississippi congress.  It was not an Omaha exposition nor a Council Bluffs exposition, but was an enterprise for the good of the entire western country.  The men who composed the directory had been selected by the people of Omaha and had laid aside their personal prejudices and personal benefits and were working for the success of the project without reference to any one section or any one set of people.  The project was one that had grown on the committee.  When it was remembered that two-thirds of the territory, one-third of the population, and one-half of the wealth of the nation was represented in the Transmississippi region it could not be imagined what a proper exposition of the region's resources would mean.  He believed that the exposition, properly carried out, would be one of the greatest enterprises the west had ever seen.  He cited figures of expositions held in other cities of the world with the attendance at each and said a conservative estimate would place the attendance at the Omaha exposition at 5,000,000.  The benefits, direct and indirect, that would come from such a gathering were simply beyond estimate.</p>

                            <head type="sub">IOWA'S DIRECT INTEREST.</head>
                            <p>He spoke of Iowa's direct interest in the project.  The question of location, he said, was one that could not be discussed until the financial matters connected with the project had been settled.  It would require the people of Omaha and Nebraska to raise at least $500,000, and this money should be raised before any question of location should be considered.  The present directory was not pledged to any location, had not discussed any location and would not do so until the money problem had been settled.  He asked for the co-operation of the council in furthering the project.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock was called upon and spoke enthusiastically of the scope of the work.  He had recently made a trip through the west and was more than ever impressed with the wonderful wealth of the transmississippi country, and said an exposition such as planned would rivet the attention of the world on the great west and would turn the channel of commerce in this direction and would inure to the everlasting benefit of the people of the transmississippi country.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">PROVOKED ENTHUSIASM.</head>
                            <p>John A. Wakefield of Omaha uncorked a good deal of enthusiasm and told the council and the committees that the more they looked around the more satisfied they were that they had <choice><sic>builded</sic><corr>built</corr></choice> wisely so far in laying the foundations for the great exposition.  The exposition idea was one of the features of the times.  Half a dozen expositions had been started, but all but the Transmississippi project had been abandoned, largely for the reason that their promoters had not begun right.  The Texas, St. Paul and Denver schemes were practically dead, although Denver had appropriated $300,000 and used $15,000 of it.  They started wrong by not securing the positive home endorsement before going any further.  "In our scheme we have the home endorsement and are morally sure of the national.  The only step that remains to be taken to make the foundations of the great enterprise impregnable is to procure the financial endorsement of the great state of Iowa.  If we can induce the Iowa legislature to make an appropriation, even though it be small, with a promise that $50,000 or more will follow, it will knock the legs from beneath Chairman Dingley's objections to the congressional bill."</p>
                            <p>Spencer Smith said he had been out of the city all winter and knew less than he should about the contemplated enterprise, but if he ever had any doubts about its feasibility they were removed.  He thought it unfortunate that the matter of asking an appropriation from the Iowa legislature had been delayed to so late a date.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">TIME VERY SHORT.</head>
                            <p>The time was short when any action could be taken.  The appropriation committees had finished their work and made their reports and he feared that it would be extremely difficult to get them to consider any new propositions to take money from the state treasury.  This was particularly the case since the appropriations already reached nearly $1,500,000, and all of the state institutions were begging and praying for additional sums.  He urged that whatever action was taken that it should be taken at once.</p>
                            <p>Alderman Casper moved that the report of the committee be adopted.  It was seconded and carried unanimously.</p>
                            <p>George F. Wright spoke of the importance of having the Iowa legislature make the necessary appropriation, which was the only sort of recognition that would satisfy Chairman Dingley.  A carload of resolutions would do no good unless the right sort of committee was sent to Des Moines to present them and urge the necessity for prompt action.  That committee should consist of at least seven men, and they should be representative men and real workers.  As vice president of the executive committee for Iowa, which would be the banner state in the group, he would consent to be a member of the Des Moines committee, and he thought Mayor Carson should be another.</p>
                            <p>After nominating himself and the mayor he thought the other members should be named by members of the council.  Alderman Pace then took the responsibility of naming the mayor, George F. Wright, Spencer Smith, I. M. Treynor, T. C. Dawson, R. J. Clancey and T. J. Evans.  At the suggestion of Alderman Shubert the members of the Omaha executive committee were invited and requested to accompany the Council Bluffs men to Des Moines.</p>
                            <p>The resolutions as amended by Alderman Barstow read as follows:</p>

                            <p>Whereas, Delegates representing the twenty-four states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river, at the Transmississippi congress held in Omaha in 1895, adopted a resolution providing for the holding of an exposition for the purpose of exhibiting the products, manufactures, arts and industries of these states and territories; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Said congress voted unanimously to hold the said exposition at the city of Omaha in the year 1898; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The common interest of all the states and territories constituting this great region, as well as the country at large, will be greatly promoted thereby, and the material interests of this city will be especially benefited by such an exposition; therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, By the city council of the city of Council Bluffs, that the holding of said Transmississippi exposition is hereby heartily approved, and that the senators and representatives in congress from Iowa are requested to use their best efforts in procuring the passage at this session of congress of a bill giving national recognition to said exposition, and providing for an appropriation for a national exhibit and the necessary and proper buildings to contain the same, and be it further</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That a copy of the foregoing resolutions be sent under seal of the city of Council Bluffs to the senators and representatives in congress from Iowa, and be it further</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we request our senators and representatives from this district to use every effort to secure a proper appropriation through our state legislature at the present session to properly represent the state of Iowa, and in necessary recognition of the great benefit to be derived therefrom by the citizens of the west and the state of Iowa.</p>
                            <p>The committee will leave at 5:20 this evening, and will be on hand when the legislature convenes Monday morning.  The men will all go with the intention of staying a week, or longer if necessary.  Mayor Carson will not go until Tuesday morning on account of his presence being required at the first regular meeting of the new council Monday night, when he will announce his appointments.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Talks the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Into Promising Support to the Transmississippi Measure.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 4.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The ways and means committee disposed of the filled cheese bill today, but the Transmississippi bill was not taken up, as was expected.  However, Representative Mercer feels more sanguine over the outcome tonight than he has felt before at any time.  The chief opponent of the measure up to the present has been Chairman Dingley.  There was reason to fear Dingley's opposition might be dangerous to ultimate chances of the bill.  Today Mercer had a long talk with Dingley, during which he pointed out that Omaha asks no more from the government than was accorded similar expositions held during the past ten years at New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville and Atlanta.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer explained to Dingley that Omaha people expect to open an exposition that will Omaha people expect an exposition that will not be merely local, but one which will represent the entire country.  After the conference between the two gentlemen, Mr. Mercer told The Bee correspondent that he was satisfied that Dingley may henceforth be counted as among the friends of the project.  In fact, Mercer is satisfied, now that the principal opposition has been virtually silenced, that the bill will be reported favorably by the entire committee.  Turner of Georgia is the only democrat opposed to the bill.  He opposed the Atlanta appropriation, but did so from principle.  He will not support the Omaha bill, but will take no steps to oppose it.  The matter will come up probably Monday, and final action will be taken by a full committee report to be agreed upon not later than the end of the week.</p>
                            <p>Representative Andrews today succeeded in passing the bill to pension ex-Governor Thayer at the rate of $100 per month.  This bill was down about No. 200 on the private calendar of the house.  When Andrews tried to get it taken up for consideration, at the pension session last night, he was opposed <unclear reason="torn"/> bills on the cal-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The recent western trip of City Attorney Hazelton with the Omaha committee representing the Trans-Mississippi exposition resulted in a special meeting of the city council last evening.  There were present, in addition to the mayor and councilmen, Mr. Hazelton, George F. Wright, vice president of the Trans-Mississippi exposition from Iowa, and a delegation from the Omaha directorate, consisting of G. W. Wattles, G. M. Hitchcock, John A. Wakefield, Z. T. Lindsey, G. H. Payne and Dan Farrell, jr.</p>
                            <p>Resolutions were introduced and read, and Mr. Wright in a characteristic speech introduced Mr. Wattles, who briefly recalled the session of the trans-Mississippi congress in Omaha last year when it was decided that the exposition in 1898 should be held in Omaha.  This exposition, he said, does not belong to Omaha, to Council Bluffs or to any other city or section, but it belongs to all the twenty-four states and territories for whose benefit it is to be held.  The men who have been chosen to take charge of the preparations for it have laid aside their personal interests in their labors in behalf of this enterprise, which is representative of two-thirds of the territory of the union, one-third of its population and one-half its wealth.</p>
                            <p>In connection with what might be expected from the exposition, Mr. Wattles gave some interesting figures showing the attendance on other great expositions.  At the exposition held in London in 1851, lasting 144 days, 6,000,000 people attended.  At Paris in 1855, during 200 days, 5,167,000 persons attended.  In London in 1862, 6,211,000 persons attended during 171 days.  At the Paris exposition in 1867, during 217 days the attendance was 10,200,000.  At the Philadelphia Centennial, which continued 159 days, the attendance was 9,910,000.  The Chicago World's fair had an attendance of 27, 539,000 during the 180 days, and the Atlantic exposition in 1895, during 100 days, showed an attendance of 1,200,000.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles said careful estimates showed that the Trans-Mississippi exposition should have an attendance of 5,000,000, and he dwelt briefly but forcibly on the advantages which such an influx of people should bring to this community.</p>
                            <p>This line of thought was taken up by Mr. G. M. Hitchcock, who said that he was a doubting Thomas when the exposition was first proposed, because he felt that the west, its people and particularly its business men, had been pushed too far and burdened too heavily.  Investigation, however, had convinced him that the exposition should be made a success at whatever cost.  Waves of financial depression are inevitable, and have their following waves of prosperity.  He believed the time now ripe for this enterprise.  The first fruits of the exposition to this locality would be not only that the hotels would be filled for six months and Council Bluffs and Omaha would be thronged with strangers, but the channels of commerce would be turned this way, just as commerce was turned to Chicago by the world's fair and to the south by the Atlanta exposition.  The eyes of the nation and of the world would be turned on the west, and whatever advantages the great districts to the west of us might receive, Council Bluffs and Omaha would receive their share, because here is the great center of commerce in the west.  Mr. Hitchcock spoke of the trip he recently took with others through the west.  Mr. Hitchcock spoke of the trip he recently took with others through the west, the manner in which they were received, the promises made to them and the enthusiasm they everywhere found for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Lindsey and Wakefield spoke briefly and Spencer Smith made a short talk, in which he expressed the belief that it will be difficult to secure an adequate appropriation from the Iowa legislature owing to the fact that the movement in this direction was started late.</p>
                            <p>The resolutions before offered, together with an amendment suggested by Alderman Barstow, were passed.  They were as follows:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Delegates representing the twenty-four states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river, at the trans-Mississippi congress, held in Omaha in 1895, adopted a resolution providing for the holding of an exposition for the purpose of exhibiting the products, manufactures, arts and industries of these states and territories, and,</p>

                            <p>A committee, consisting of Mayor Carson, George F. Wright, Spencer Smith, T. C. Dawson, I. M. Treynor, R. J. Clancy and T. J. Evans, was appointed to go to Des Moines to use their influence to secure the passage of the bill for the appropriation for the Iowa representation.  The committee, with the exception of the mayor, will leave this evening for Des Moines.  The mayor will leave Thursday.</p>

                            <p>We, your special committee, to whom was referred the communication of the Honorable Mayor Broatch, of Omaha, Nebraska, beg leave to submit the following resolution and recommend its adoption.</p>
                            <p>WHEREAS, It is intended to promote the common interest of the States and Territories of the United States, lying west of the Mississippi River, by holding in the City of Omaha,State of Nebraska, during the year 1898, an Exposition of the products, industries, arts and civilization of said region, to the end that its wonderful and diversified resources may become better known to mankind; and</p>
                            <p>WHEREAS, Such Exposition will afford to the people of Utah an opportunity to bring to the notice of the world, not only what they have accomplished by patience, persistence and toil in transforming a barren and desolate wilderness into a productive and prosperous State, but as well, knowledge of the marvellous diversity of the mineral resources which it possesses, the magnificence of its climate and the multitude of its attractions; and</p>
                            <p>WHEREAS, It is most fitting that the people whose pioneers broke the first trail over the region to be illustrated in the Exposition and first conveyed to civilization an account of its boundless undeveloped wealth, should be participants in said Exposition; and</p>
                            <p>WHEREAS, The State of Utah contains within its borders not only the best illustrations of the efficacy of irrigation in the redemption of our arid lands, but as well, mines of almost every mineral known to mineralogy, knowledge of which, if communicated to the world, will result in attracting to the State vast capital and a large additional population; therefore</p>
                            <p>BE IT RESOLVED by the City Council of Salt Lake City;that we are in hearty accord with the plan of holding at Omaha the said</p> <!-- Page missing? -->

                            <p>The senate today passed the Omaha exposition bill without opposition, and with but one amendment suggested by Mr. Allison, reducing the amount of the appropriation for a government exhibit from $250,000 to $200,000, the same as that appropriated for the Atlanta exposition.  The bill carries no actual appropriation, but it pledges the government to appropriate that sum.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of the vice president, Mr. Frye rep., Me.) occupied the <choice><sic>crair</sic><corr>chair</corr></choice> today as president of the senate pro tem.  Mr. Call (dem., Fla.) inquired of the chairman of the judiciary committee whether that committee had made any progress in the consideration of the matter heretofore referred to it as to the legislation necessary to restrain United States courts in cases of contempt.  He made the inquiry, he said, at the request of Eugene V. Debs and the leaders of the labor movement in the United States.</p>

                            <head type="sub">IN HILL'S HANDS.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Hoar (rep., Mass.), chairman of the judiciary committee, stated, in reply, that the matter had been referred to Senator Hill (dem., N. Y.), as a substitute committee, who had undertaken to make a careful collection of the laws on the subject and to prepare a measure in the committee.  A carefully prepared bill on the subject had been introduced yesterday by another member of the committee&#8212;Mr. Thurston (rep., Neb.)  The matter, therefore, had not been overlooked.  The committee was dealing with it as rapidly as the nature of the case admitted.  How soon the matter would be ripe for a report by the committee was a question which ought to be addressed to the senator from New York&#8212;not now present.</p>
                            <p>The Indian appropriation bill was then taken up, the first 65 pages of it having been already disposed of, except as to reserved amendments.</p>
                            <p>The bill having been read in full, the senate proceeded to act on the reserved amendments.</p>

                            <p>There was almost a unanimity of sentiment against a sudden change of system from contract schools to government schools, and there was an almost equal unanimity in favor of such a gradual change as would not do injustice either to the religious societies which had established the schools, or to the Indian children who attended them.  The matter went over, however, without action.</p>
                            <p>Earlier in the day a joint resolution on the subject of the imprisonment of Mrs. Maybrick in England was introduced by Mr. Call of Florida, to the apparent annoyance of Mr. Sherman of Ohio, chairman of the committee on foreign relations, who desired such a proposition should not have been introduced, as the senate had no jurisdiction over the subject.  He moved to lay the joint resolution on the table; but finally consented to have it referred to the judiciary committee, which disposition was made of it.</p>
                            <p>The senate at 5:25 o'clock adjourned until Monday.</p>

                            <p>Des Moines, Ia., April 10.&#8212;The house bill appropriating $<del>25</del>15,000 for the Omaha exposition passed the senate today.  The house bill permitting the use of public parks as sites for public libraries was passed.  The house today passed the senate bill fixing the amount of revenue required by the state for the next biennial period at $1,400,000 per year.  This necessitates a state levy by the executive council of 2 mills which is 2-100 of a mill higher than has ever been levied before, even with the increased levy it is not thought that the income will be sufficient to meet the appropriations made by the legislature.  An amendment by Representative Porter (dem.), to make the levy 2½ mills was defeated by a straight party vote.</p>
                            <p>In the house today the senate resolution to require all portraits of actual soldiers, living or dead, to be taken for the soldiers' monument was agreed to.  The senate bill to prohibit the operations of Lloyds Insurance companies in the state was defeated.  The senate bill permitting the trustees of the soldiers' home to retain the pension money of the inmates in excess of $6 per <choice><sic>motnh</sic><corr>month</corr></choice> was passed.  The senate bill to create a state board of embalmers was killed.  The committee bill for a new jury law was killed.  The pardon of James Johnson, convicted of murder in Pottawattamie county, was recommended.  The senate amendments to create a bill for the control of the pharmacy commission, was agreed to.  In the senate the bill to create the board of police and fire <choice><sic>commissioiers</sic><corr>commissioners</corr></choice> to be appointed by the governor to have charge of these departments in all cities with more than 50,000 population was passed.  The bill was backed by the present employes of the departments who fear discharge by the incoming administration.  Desperate effort will be made tomorrow to put the bill through the house.</p>

Even Dave Mercer, who is in charge of the bill in the house, had grown considerably uneasy over the dilatory policy shown by the subcommittee and was almost convinced that the only thing to do to save the bill at this session was to report it in the form as introduced by Senator Allen and amended by the committee on international expositions.  This morning, however, the subcommittee, through General Grosvenor, reported the bill to the full house committee on ways and means, but the report carried with it no recommendation, leaving the whole matter to be churned over before the committee.  Under these circumstances Senators Allen and Thurston decided to blaze the pathway and this morning immediately after the regular order of business had been completed Senator Allen called up his bill.  Unexpected objection was met from Senator Brown of Utah, who either did not understand what Senator Allen desired or was afraid that a bill in which he was greatly interested would lost its place on the calendar by reason of taking up the exposition bill.  His objection carried the bill over for the time being.  In the meanwhile Thurston looked after the republican side of the chamber, while Allen did like service with his democratic and populistic colleagues.  Senator Thurston overcame the objection that Senator Sherman had shown to the bill yesterday, and fully explained to Senator Brown that no intention was meant to displace his bill on the calendar.  After these disturbing factors had been taken care of, Senator Pettigrew was importuned to yield a few minutes at the close of the day's session to put the bill on its passage, he being in charge of the Indian appropriation bill.  Just as the senate was about to adjourn the bill was called up.  Senator Allison, chairman of the committee on appropriations, expressed himself as being enthusiastically in favor of the bill, but thought it should carry no more than the Atlanta exposition bill carried, namely, $200,000.  Rather than be considered captious Senator Allen accepted the amendment and the bill was passed without a negative vote being recorded against it.</p>

                            <p>Senator Allison stated to Senator Thurston after the passage of the bill that if the senate bill could be gotten through the house within the next week or two, he would see to it that a small amount of money, say $25,000, might be made immediately available by a place in the sundry civil bill, which he would take upon himself to accomplish.</p>
                            <p>While the bill, as passed, differs very materially from the house bill, it is evident that nothing more could have been obtained from the senate, opposition on the house side, and the disposition of the senate to hold down all appropriations for new legislation, and the eve of a presidential election, all combining to make a larger appropriation impossible at this time.  The senators in charge of the bill recognize that it is a tub to a whale, but they took what they could get, with hope that a new congress and a new administration might give them an increased amount if such proved necessary.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Grosvenor, chairman of the subcommittee having the Transmississippi exposition bill in charge, reported the measure to the full ways and means committee this morning without amendment.  Through the efforts of Congressman Mercer every member of the committee was present.  Mr. Grosvenor desired immediate action, but chairman Dingley objected to what he characterized as snap judgment.  Consequently the bill will have a hearing on its merits.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Dingley is by no means hostile to the bill.  He has some objections, to its present form, however, and if these objections are met by the western states interested in the project Mr. Dingley's objections may prove of great benefit to the promoters of the bill.  He desires some assurance that the western states are back of the project, and to the end that these assurances may be given he stated today that he would consent to a proviso that the government should make an appropriation of $500,000, conditional upon the appropriation of a like amount by the states and territories in the transmississippi territory.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GEORGE F. WRIGHT TELLS OF THE LOBBYING DONE BY THE COUNCIL BLUFFS COMMITTEE FOR THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION AT DES MOINES&#8212;SENATOR PUSEY'S STRENGTH IN THE SENATE.</head>
                            <p>The committee appointed by the city council last Saturday to go to Des Moines and work for the passage of a bill for an appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition have returned from the capital and are well pleased with the result of their labors.  The members of the committee who took part in the work were George F. Wright, I. M. Treynor, T. C. Dawson, A. S. Hazelton and R .J. Clancy.  By hard work they succeeded in getting an appropriation for the preliminary expenses ,with an assurance from the members of both houses that a larger amount would be granted if requested at the next session.  There will probably be an extra session called before the regular meeting in 1898.</p>
                            <p>In speaking of the work of the members of the committee in getting the bill through, Mr. Wright said:  "Too much praise cannot be accorded Messrs. Treynor and Dawson for the thorough and efficient manner in which they assisted in accomplishing this work.  Being young and energetic and in touch with the politicians of the state they are once, on their arrival, organized their forces.  They called to the aid of the committee the veteran in legislation, Gib Prey and Col. McMillan, chairman of the republican state central committee, whose ability to secure results is unlimited.  With the assistance of Representative Weaver of Louisa county, who had already introduced the bill in the house, the house committee on appropriations was called.  This was its last meeting as a final adjournment had been agreed upon for today.  City Attorney Hazelton appeared before the committee and made an able presentation of the bill and secured a favorable report on the measure.</p>
                            <p>"Good missionary work was done among the representatives by the members of the committee, Mr. Clancy getting his democratic friends in line.  Our own representatives, Messrs. Putnam and Potter, showed by their work that they were among the most influential members of the house.  Speaker Byers was also heartily in favor of the bill and, perhaps, did more than any one person to secure the prompt passage of the same, and the people of Council Bluffs and this vicinity should accord to him a full measure of their thanks for his efforts on their behalf.  Sergeant at Arms Wilson of Casey also did efficient work in securing members for the support of the bill.</p>
                            <p>"The committee at once, with the assistance of Representative Weaver, had the bill taken over and reported to the senate.  Here again Messrs. Dawson and Treynor were able to call to their aid their political friends.  Senator Pusey, than whom there is no better worker or more influential legislator in the state, had the house bill at once referred to the senate committee on appropriations, secured a favorable report and when it was put upon its final passage made a brilliant speech in its support.  Thus, with the aid of Senators Waterman of Ottumwa, chairman of the committee on appropriations; Junkin, of Red Oak, Phelps of Atlantic, Rank of Iowa City, Bonson of Dubuque and Mr. Clancy to bring his democratic friends in line, the bill was passed without a dissenting voice.  The committee are frank to say but for the personal popularity of Senator Pusey with every member of the senate, the bill could not have been passed at the late hour it reached that body."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 13.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Renewed impetus, if such a thing were possible, was given today to the Transmississippi exposition bill by the presence in Washington of President Gurdon W. Wattles of the exposition association.  Mr. Wattles, true to western instinct, allowed no grass to spring up under his feet upon his arrival, and at once called upon members of the Nebraska delegation to ascertain the status of the bill now pending in the house, and also the chances of the senate bill passing the house.  Accompanied by Mr. Mercer, he had an interview with Chairman Dingley of the house ways and means committee, which was entirely satisfactory to Mr. Wattles.  He stated to Mr. Dingley that it was the desire of his people to have an appropriation of $500,000, one-fifth of which was to be spent upon the erection of a building and the remainder of the amount appropriated on a governmental exhibit and incidentals.  This was in line with Representative Mercer's bill, which was reported to the full committee last week by Grosvenor's subcommittee.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Dingley remarked that had the east asked for such an appropriation he would be bitterly opposed to any such legislation at the present session of congress.  He recognized, however, that two-thirds of the area of the United States was included in the territory sought to be benefited; that one-third of the population lived west of the Mississippi river, and that a great deal of the wealth of the United States was to be found in the twenty-four states and territories moving for the exposition.  Under these considerations he would not antagonize the bill, but would, within a few days, give it a hearing before the full committee.  He stated that several amendments would have to be attached to the bill, one of which would be to the effect that $250,000 be subscribed as capital stock and approved by the secretary of the treasury.  To this Mr. Wattles agreed.</p>
                            <p>Later in the day Mr. Wattles called upon Senator Allen, who explained to him the difficulty that was in the way of securing any larger appropriation than that contained in the senate bill.  He stated that he had canvassed the situation in the senate very closely and had been long enough in legislative life to know if $200,000 was pledged by congress at this session that a larger amount might be forthcoming from the subsequent congress.  He asserted that he wanted the bill to become a law, and to this end had accepted amendments proposed by Chairman Allison of the appropriations committee, because he recognized that nothing else was obtainable.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DECIDED ON THE SENATE BILL.</head>
                            <p>With these divergent views before him, Mr. Wattles has decided to bring all his influence to bear upon the senate bill, now pending in the house, and will ask his friends who have influence with Speaker Reed to ask for a speedy recognition of the bill when reported, to the end that it may be passed and get to the president within the next six weeks, for congress will be gone by that time should present indications continue.  President Wattles, speaking of his impressions as gathered in a somewhat hasty view of the situation, said:</p>
                            <p>"Our people were somewhat surprised at the action of the senate on Friday in passing the senate bill.  We thought our delegation was acting together in the interests of the bill.  While The Bee reflected exactly the situation as I find it today in its dispatches of Saturday morning, it was thought best that I should come on here on see what could be done to advance the interests of the measure.  While I do not believe the senate bill is adequate to the needs of the association, I think it is the best we can obtain at this time, and I shall use every endeavor to have the bill pass the house, with such amendments as the ways and means committee shall agree upon.  I have assurances from Senator Allen that any reasonable amendment will be agreed to by the conference committee to which the bill will have to go in event of any amendations.  Our people are being aroused to the importance of the measure and will be able to take care of it in a manner creditable to the great section of country which the exposition will seem to represent.  Mr. Dingley, while not antagonizing the bill, stated that his only objection to it was upon the ground that the government would have to borrow money to further the enterprise.  This was to him a serious objection, but as the great west had never asked for any appropriation for such an undertaking he was inclined to waive his objection for the advertisement and consequent building up of the transmississippi country which must inevitable follow."</p>

                            <p>Mr. Wattles is accompanied by Mrs. Wattles and Mr. Henry Wyman, who is here to look after the liquidation of the debts of the American National bank, growing out of the amalgamation of the Union and American National banks.  They will have an interview with Comptroller Eckels in the morning to decide upon the details necessary to the American National going out of business, the Union National having assumed the liabilities of the former bank.  Mr. Wattles is vice president of the Union National and Mr. Wyman cashier of the American National.  Upon the settlement of the questions which brought them here, Mr. Wattles and Mr. Wyman will devote several days to furthering the interests of the Omaha exposition.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston (through Senator Allen) introduced a pension bill today for the relief of Mary F. Hawley, widow of the late General John B. Hawley, at $50 per month.  He also introduced a petition of members of Hancock Circle No. 12 of Burwell, Neb., asking for the passage of a service pension bill.</p>
                            <p>Representative Mercer presented the resolution of the National Association of Stationary Engineers of Omaha, praying for the passage of a bill to organize and increase the efficiency and personnel of the navy; also a resolution of the city council of Aurora, Neb., favoring the Omaha exposition.</p>
                            <p>Senator Pettigrew of South Dakota introduced a bill granting to the Nashville Presbyterian church of Nashville, S. D., certain lands for cemetery purposes.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Hainer of the republican state central committee has wired members of the committee that it will be impossible for him to participate in the deliberations of the state convention next Wednesday, in view of the fortifications bill, now pending in the house, which his committee reported.  He has wired Vice Chairman Mallalleu to call the convention to order and to officiate in his stead.</p>
                            <p>Representative Andrews returned from his quest for a second nomination Sunday morning, exceedingly happy over the result.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Transmississippi Directors Decide to Accept It.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield of the Transmississippi exposition has received this letter from Senator Thurston, which throws some light upon the situation in congress toward the exposition bill now before that body:</p>
                            <p>Washington, D. C., April 11.&#8212;Dear Sir: I enclose you a copy of a letter just sent to Mr. Mercer which contains concise statement of congressional situation.  We were compelled to accept the $200,000 limit, as Senator Allison insists that was the amount appropriated for Atlanta exposition.  If the bill goes through there will be no trouble about securing an appropriation to start the building with at this session, and if by the next session sufficient assurances are obtained that the exposition is to be of greater magnitude than Atlanta's we can probably secure an increase of the limit.  Permit me in this connection to say that we are all greatly indebted to Senator Allen for the interest he has taken and the assistance he has rendered in the passage of the bill.  Yours truly,</p>
                            <l>JOHN M. THURSTON.</l>
                            <l>John A. Wakefield, Esq., Omaha, Neb.</l>
                            <p>Mr. Wakefield says that President Wattles, who is now at Washington, governed by the situation as it appeared to him there, has decided to accept the senate bill.  That measure is now in the hands of a house committee, and will be amended by the adding of the appropriation, and possibly passed at an early date, and with the present feeling in the senate these amendments will be readily accepted.  After this is done, Mr. Thurston in another letter, said there would be no trouble in getting a small appropriation tacked to the sundry bill for the commencing of work on the government building.</p>
                            <p>At 4:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon the following telegram was received by Mr. Wakefield from Washington:</p>
                            <p>Washington, D. C., April 14.&#8212;John A. Wakefield, Secretary:  Dingley consents to <unclear reason="covered"/> senate bill with amendment at once.  <unclear reason="covered"/> says if bill is changed it cannot pass <unclear reason="covered"/>arrying $500,000 limit through house, <unclear reason="covered"/> $50,000 available by attaching provis-<unclear reason="covered"/>overed by our resolution.  Or he will <unclear reason="covered"/> senate bill and take no chances, and <unclear reason="covered"/>on next congress to increase amount.  <unclear reason="covered"/>nsus of opinion is we better take a <unclear reason="covered"/>thing.  Confer with leaders and wire <unclear reason="covered"/> they prefer to take chances.</p>
                            <l>G. W. WATTLES.</l>
                            <p>Upon receipt of the dispatch Mr. Wakefield got the directors and others interested in the exposition together at <unclear reason="covered"/> office to get an expression of opinion.  The result of the meeting was the word-<unclear reason="covered"/> of a telegram, which was sent to Mr. Wattles before 6 o'clock, as follows:</p>
                            <p>Gurdon W. Wattles, Ebbitt House, Washington D. C.:  Meeting of the full directory, with Messrs. Rosewater, Lindsey and Hitchcock, decided as follows:  We favor Dingley reporting senate bill immediately, with amendment increasing limit and making definite amount available.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WATTLES ASKS ADVICE FROM OMAHA</head>
                            <head type="sub">Final Choice of Two Bills Deferred Until Word Can Be Had from the Local Managers of the Project.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 14.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;President Wattles, after consultation with Chairman Dingley of the ways and means committee, Representatives Dolliver of Iowa, and Mercer, Hainer and Meiklejohn of Nebraska, this afternoon wired Secretary Wakefield of the Exposition association to ascertain of the leaders in the movement as to their judgment on the pending senate and house bills.  He stated that the consensus of opinion here was that the senate bill should be accepted, but desired advice from Omaha people that there might not be any discrimination should one or other of the bills have to be dropped.  He wanted to know if the exposition managers desired to take changes on the house bill with a view of increasing the appropriation it carries later on.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles had a long conference with Mr. Dingley today in which the chairman of ways and means stated that his committee would report the senate bill without amendment, or if the exposition people desire to take chances, he would attempt to have the house bill reported, carrying $500,000 appropriation surrounded by the safeguards he proposed yesterday, namely, that $280,000 should be subscribed as capital stock certified by the secretary of the treasury, before the money of the government should issue.</p>
                            <p>While Mr. Mercer believes he can pass the house bill, the uncertainty attaching to the senate's action makes him hesitate to push the measure and he has thrown the whole matter on the people of Omaha to say what they want.  In view of the short time remaining of the session the best opinion seems to be that the senate bill had better be taken and that if the states come forward next winter as expected in the way of appropriations, it will be time enough to attempt an additional appropriation from the government.</p>

                            <p>Representative Dolliver, who is enthusiastically in favor of the bill, will have a conference with Senator Allison with a view of ascertaining the possibility of increasing the appropriation, everybody conceding that $500,000 is absolutely needed to make the exposition international in its character and reflective of the great country which it will exploit.  Dolliver, however, is not hopeful of securing Senator Allison's sanction for the increases.</p>
                            <p>Here is where the whole matter will stand till Mr. Wattles can hear from Omaha as to the wishes of his people.  Whatever they decide upon he will go in to accomplish and in this he will have the support of the whole northwest section.  Dingley wanted to report the senate bill tomorrow, but he was asked to hold off until Friday, at least until Mr. Wattles might become acquainted with the desires of the managers in Omaha, and at the same time satisfy himself that whatever was done would be to the best interests of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Transmississippi Exposition Scheme Will Go Through This Session.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 16.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;A conference this morning between President Wattles and members of Nebraska delegations resulted in its decision to push the senate exposition bill.  Congressman Mercer will arrange with Dingley when the committee will take up the bill, which in all probability will be next Monday.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Dingley says some of the members of the ways and means committee desire to surround the bill with the safeguard of having the Omaha people raise a certain amount of money before the government appropriation is made available.  This is satisfactory to President Wattles.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Hopes to Have the Action of the Omaha Managers to Present to the Congressmen Who Are Interested.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 15.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The exposition bill still rests in the hands of the committee on ways and means.  Representative Mercer endeavored to have a definite agreement with Chairman Dingley as to when it should be reported, but the chairman was too busy on the alcohol bill to take up anything not german to that subject today.  It is thought that a definite course of action will be decided upon tomorrow, when Mr. Wattles will undoubtedly have advices from Omaha as to the decision of the managers there.  The bill for the Nashville centennial exposition, carrying an immediate appropriation, has been introduced in the house, and this, it is thought, will give an additional string for the Transmississippi people to pull.  Nashville intends holding the exposition next year and needs the money at once.  When the ways and means committee adjourned today it was to the next regular meeting next week.  There is nothing, however, in the way of calling a special meeting to consider the Omaha exposition bill, which will be done whenever a concerted plan of action is agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Wattles and Wyman had a talk with Comptroller Eckels today relative to liquidating the debts of the American National bank.  A plan was agreed upon and Mr. Wyman left for home tonight.  Mr. Wattles will remain until something definite as to the exposition bill is decided upon.</p>
                            <p>Percy Lamoreux, special examiner of the general land office, who was sent to Wyoming to examine certain lands in which the Globe Canal company of Omaha is interested, has returned to Washington.  While his report has not been made public, enough has been learned by the members of congress interested in securing these lands for the company, that the report, now before the secretary of the interior, finds that on certain forties timber is growing in sufficient quantity to warrant the government's intercession, but that on a large portion of the land in controversy he found little timber, and recommends that a title be given the company for these.  There are about 1,000 acres held up and the company is growing anxious to have the matter settled, in view of intending settlers desiring to take up lands along the canal.  It is further stated that the report recommends most liberal treatment to this company in the use of water rights, the location of dams, etc., on the timber reservations.  The return of Secretary Smith will probably wind this matter up in a very short time.</p>
                            <p>Acting Secretary of the Interior Reynolds today transmitted to the <choice><sic>commisioner</sic><corr>commissioner</corr></choice> of the general land office instructions to local officers at North Platte, Neb., land district as to entries upon lands embraced in the abandoned Fort McPherson military reservation.  The report of the appraisers shows that the reservation embraced 19,500 acres, all of which is surveyed, except the original reservation of four miles square, or about 10,240 acres.  Of the land embraced in the reservation odd numbered sections accrue to the Union Pacific Railroad company, in part satisfaction of the grant to aid its construction.  The even numbered sections of the surveyed land, except a military road 200 feet wide and seven-eighths of a mile long, have been appraised at $11,432.  The land will be patented to actual settlers under the homestead law at its appraised value.  Settlement can date back to August 23, 1894, the date of the approval of an act restoring the reservation to the public domain.</p>

                            <p>The trans-Mississippi congress, which met in Omaha November 25, last, adopted resolutions unanimously concurred in by delegates present from the trans-Mississippi states, locating the proposed trans-Mississippi exposition in 1898 at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>From that day leading men in Omaha and the congressional delegation from Nebraska have been busily engaged in pushing preliminary work incident to a full organization of working forces.  The exposition will not be, strictly speaking, an Omaha enterprise.  The articles which were adopted at an enthusiastic mass meeting of Omaha citizens recently contemplate an exposition of all the products, industries an civilization of the states and territories
                            <figure><ab>GORDON W. WATTLES, PRESIDENT.</ab></figure>
                            of the United States west of the Mississippi river, and also such exhibits as may be provided in the United States, in any state of the union or any foreign country, for the purpose particularly of exhibiting to the world the products and capabilities of said states and territories.  The articles provide that the exposition shall be opened in June and closed in November, 1898.  The responsibility for the success of the enterprise must therefore devolve upon the vast empire embracing the western and Rocky mountain states.</p>
                            <p>The people of Omaha and Nebraska, however, are determined that the project shall be pushed to a successful issue.  It was left to them to take the initiative and to put the machinery in motion.  To this task the citizens of Omaha have addressed themselves with energy and enthusiasm.  The corporation is organized with a capital stock of $1,000,000, with shares at ten dollars, there being a proviso that when $10,000 of the stock shall have been subscribed business shall be commenced.  At a recent meeting nearly $11,000 was subscribed by those present within a few minutes and strong committees were named to further subscriptions.  A board of eleven directors, as provided was named, among them being the active and influential business men of the city.  This board elected as their president G. W. Wattles, and as secretary John A. Wakefield.</p>

                            <p>Besides selected the delegates the convention adopted a money plank which declared in so many words against the free coinage of silver after a futile effort to silence the convention on that issue.  The only other difference of any consequence was over the ratification of the resolutions adopted in Omaha some time ago as a compromise between the supporters of McKinley and Manderson.  In this case Senator Thurston's plea for the compromise resolutions failed to find a sympathetic response and a substitute resolution was adopted which contained no other name than that of William McKinley.</p>
                            <p>The convention hall itself was the largest, best ventilated and most convenient ever tendered for the use of a state gathering in Nebraska.  There was no crowding of delegates into narrow aisles, on the stage and in galleries.  Everybody had plenty of room, and the arched ceiling nearly a hundred feet from the floor gave ample opportunity for breathing&#8212;a luxury seldom enjoyed by conventions in Nebraska.  The floats and paraphernalia belonging to the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben lent a picturesque feature to the otherwise severe plainness of the Interior.  The Second Infantry band from Fort Omaha was in attendance, and while the huge crowd was assembling played a varied program, literally interspersed with lively campaign melodies.  On the immense stage back of the speaker's desk, on the west side of the auditorium, <unclear reason="torn"/>sented a large number of the prominent <unclear reason="torn"/>

                                    ng <unclear reason="torn"/> time <unclear reason="torn"/> Mallalieu of the <unclear reason="torn"/>vention called the con-<unclear reason="torn"/>r.  In the absence of Chairman <unclear reason="torn"/>er, who is detained in Washington by important duties in connection with his official position, Mr. Mallalieu had had general charge of the preliminary work of preparing for the convention.  When he arose to call the convention to order he faced an assemblage of fully 3,500 people.  He first introduced the John L. Webster Glee club of Omaha.  The club sang a campaign melody, the accompanying words portraying the ponderous woes of one Grover Cleveland and depicting in general terms the panic stricken condition of the democrats.  The big crowd liked the sentiment and applauded the glee club.  Tim Sedgwick of York, secretary of the republican state central committee then read the call.  This formality being over, Vice Chairman Mallalieu introduced as the temporary chairman of the convention Hon. William P. McCreary of Hastings.</p>
                            <p>Mr. McCreary's brief speech was listened to with close attention by those close enough to the platform to hear it.  Unfortunately, however, the crush of delegates constantly crowding into the rear and sides of the auditorium created so much noise and confusion that the greater portion of the audience was unable to catch much of the best part of the eloquent speaker's address.  The temporary chairman was frequently applauded, his references to McKinley giving full opportunity for the escape of the pent-up enthusiasm and his demand for the complete demonetization of democracy and the free and unlimited coinage of republicanism, honest money, protection and reciprocity brought down the house.  Mr. McCreary said in part:</p>

                            <p>"It would be indeed a cold heart that would not be warmed by such an occasion as this.  Especially is this true at this time because this is the beginning of a campaign of people who have sent their representatives to this convention to declare their views upon the vital questions of the hour.  Never was there a time in American politics since the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, when the people were so serious as they are today.  It is not a blow struck at a statesman this time, but one struck <choice><sic>directely</sic><corr>directly</corr></choice> at American industries and the American homes.  The people who have selected these delegates are entitled to the deliberate judgment of this convention.  Like the Israelite of old, they are seeking for a Moses to lead them out of the wilderness.  It has been charged that in selecting the delegates to this convention there were cases in which the will of the people was not consulted.  I have no need to deny this accusation.  The people have but one idea in this campaign, and this convention would be false to them if it did not declare in favor of one great exponent of the protective tariff principle.  I refer to Major William McKinley of Ohio.  (Prolonged applause.)</p>
                            <p>"It has been said that Major McKinley is no more entitled to credit for the McKinley law than any other member of the committee.  I remember that at one time

                            Mr. McKinley was downed in his own district because it was held that he was responsible for that law.  We hear a good deal of talk about the money question, but what the American people want is the demonetization of democracy and free coinage of republicanism."</p>
                            <p>Continuing, Mr. McCreary paid his respects to the populist party, which he characterized as the political harlot of the nineteenth century.</p>
                            <p>The purely ornamental work of the convention being finished, the business of the evening commenced in earnest.</p>
                            <p>On motion of John C. Wharton, J. M. Gillan of Omaha was made temporary secretary.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS.</head>
                            <p>Senator Thurston took the floor to move that in order to expedite business the chairman appoint a committee on resolutions, to consist of a chairman and one member from each congressional district, to which all resolutions should be referred without debate.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Crounse suggested that there was one question before the people which should be honestly faced.  He hoped that the republicans of Nebraska would be brave enough to meet the issue squarely, and in order to do that open debate was necessary.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston explained that his motion was not intended to stifle debate, but to permit it at the proper time, which was after the report of the committee.  The convention, he said, would have the courage to fight for the cardinal principles of the republican party&#8212;sound money and protection.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston's motion was then carried without opposition and the committee was appointed, as follows:  Senator Thurston, chairman; G. M. Lambertson, First district; Cadet Taylor, Second district; W. H. Needham, Third district; Thomas Wolfe, Fourth district; John J. Lamborn, Fifth district; Henry Gibbons, Sixth district.</p>
                            <p>J. L. McPheely of Minden moved that as there were no contests the services of a committee on credentials be dispensed with and that the list of delegates as in the hands of the secretary be declared elected.  This was carried.</p>
                            <p>The temporary organization was then made permanent and the convention listened to a song by Joe Barton of this city.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">TURN IT OVER TO THURSTON.</head>
                            <p>Chairman McCreary announced that the selection of the delegates to the national convention was in order.  The announcement brought Senator Thurston to his feet with a motion to expedite the work of the convention.  He suggested that inasmuch as there was no difference of opinion as to the names of three of the delegates-at-large, much time could be saved by selecting them by viva voce vote.  He therefore moved that John L. Webster of Douglas, Thomas P. Kennard of Lancaster and Peter Jansen of Jefferson be selected by acclamation.</p>
                            <p>The motion was seconded by a Gage county delegate, but before the question could be voted upon ex-Governor Crounse sent to the secretary's desk a substitute, which he asked to have read.  The reading of the substitute was attended with some difficulty, but, when finally before the convention, was found to be as follows:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Senator John M. Thurston has kindly volunteered to leave his seat in the United States senate and journey several times half way across the continent to attend the meeting of the state republican committee and direct its proceedings in issuing its call for this convention; also to have himself made delegate to ward and county conventions, and, as self-constituted dictator, happily styled King John the First, has issued his edict directing the selection of himself, John L. Webster and Peter Jansen as delegates to the national republican convention and fixing the boundaries from which this convention may elect the other two delegates-at-large; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It is understood that, having gathered to himself the several titles and offices of senator, delegate and dictator, he is ambitious for the additional honor of being nominated as vice president, or holding a place in the cabinet, when, as secretary of the interior or attorney general, he can be of further and greater service to the Pacific railroads, whose passes and stolen millions have been used to advance the honored gentleman to his present commanding position; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The senator by innumerable proclamations, letters and interviews has given the public in general and presidential candidates in particular to understand that he carries the republican party of Nebraska in his pocket; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, In order that this impression may continue and the chances of the senator for gratifying his ambition be not impaired by any act of independence or disloyalty on the part of the republicans here assembled; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, We recognize in the senator a willingness and a confidence in his own ability to go to St. Louis, as the entire sixteen delegates allotted to Nebraska, and regret that the authority of this convention will not permit us to thus constitute him, therefore in order to effect the same, and as nearly as may be; therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That Senator Thurston be requested to name all the delegates to the St. Louis convention we are assembled supposedly to select, which delegates are hereby instructed, and the district delegates are requested to vote and act in said convention under the direction and for the glory of the senator.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That an apology is due from ex-Senator Manderson to Senator Thurston for permitting the use of his name as a presidential candidate without having first obtained the consent of the senator, and for attempting to usurp the title of "Favorite Son," when it is well known that the name of our favorite is not Charles, but John; and</p>
                            <p>Resolved, lastly, That we can but admire and applaud the magnanimity of our senator in graciously consenting that the name of ex-Senator Manderson may be mentioned at St. Louis at such time or manner as will injure no one else or do him any good.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FOLLOW THE SENATOR'S SUGGESTION.</head>
                            <p>A delegate from Pawnee county moved that Crounse's substitute be laid on the table.</p>
                            <p>The reading of the substitute was greeted with a hearty and prolonged outburst of hisses which the chairman could scarcely restrain.</p>
                            <p>C. E. Holland of Seward county moved to table the substitute without any further reading.  Senator Thurston arose and found it impossible to speak because of the tremendous cheering.  He said that he had too much respect for the author to ask other than that the substitute be read in full.  He added that if, after reading, it was found to reflect any honor on the author, he hoped the convention would adopt it.  When he finished the secretary was allowed to continue with the reading.  At the mention of the selection of Senator Thurston for vice presidential candidate or for secretary of the interior the convention showed its appreciation of the suggestions offered by applause loud and long.</p>
                            <p>The chairman put the motion to table and it was carried with a shout.</p>
                            <p>The rules were suspended and the three men who had been nominated as delegates at large were unanimously chosen to represent Nebraska at St. Louis.</p>
                            <p>John L. Webster was called for and in reply made a short speech, which was well received.  He said it was simply his desire to go to St. Louis and voice the sentiment of the republicans in casting his vote for Major McKinley.  He said his time, his services and his whole attention should be at the command of the party in the fall campaign.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">TWO PRETTY PROUD MEN.</head>
                            <p>Thomas P. Kennard was called for.  He said he had been nominated twice for a state office and stood upon a platform of republicanism.  But, he said, the honor and trust that had just been confided to him he esteemed more highly.  He hoped to return from St. Louis and announce the nomination of William McKinley.</p>
                            <p>Peter Jansen was called for from several quarters of the hall at once.  Mounting the stage, he said he wouldn't trade places even with the czar of Russia.  He felt prouder at the honor given him by the sovereign people of the state of Nebraska than at any honor all the crowned heads of Europe could confer upon him.  He said the foreign element in the republican ranks loved the nation of its adoption and would always rally around its flag.  He believed under the administration of William McKinley the republican party would again bring commercial prosperity to the nation.</p>
                            <p>A double quartet from Beatrice was then announced and rendered a timely parody on a familiar college air, picturing the distress of the democratic party in strong words.  The boys were rewarded by a hearty encore and responded with a parody on "In the Sweet Bye and Bye."  It told of the failure of the populist party and predicted that it, too, would be laid on the shelf along with the democratic party.</p>
                            <p>A Douglas county representative moved to count the old soldiers in the convention in order to refute the charge that there were but few old soldiers present.  The rising vote showed a large number of Grand Army men present.  As they arose to be counted they were cheered to the echo.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OPENED THE ONLY DISPUTE.</head>
                            <p>Representative W. H. Harrison of Hall nominated George H. Thummel of his county for the fourth delegate-at-large.</p>
                            <p>The delegation of Webster counted seconded the nomination.</p>
                            <p>A Stanton county representative seconded the nomination also.  This was the signal for representatives from a large number of counties to fall into line, and they kept the chairman busy recognizing them in order that they might second Mr. Thummel's nomination.</p>
                            <p>Representative Sullivan of Custer county placed in nomination Matthew Daugherty.  Sheridan county, Banner county, Buffalo county and Valley county seconded the nomination of Daugherty.</p>
                            <p>As the roll call proceeded it became evident that Thummel was not in for a walk away.  Not until the call was nearly over was it sure that he was elected, but the final result was:  Thummel, 554; Daugherty, 498.  And Mr. Thummel was declared the unanimous nominee of the convention for the fourth place on the delegation at large.</p>
                            <p>He briefly returned his thanks for the honor conferred and Matt Daugherty took the platform to say that he was highly pleased with the selection of his opponent.  He expressed his thanks to those who had stood by him in what he characterized as the "most unholy war ever waged on a man."  He declared that like the Saviour he had suffered for the sins of others and had been handicapped by the name of Daugherty.</p>
                            <p>Someone nominated Mr. Daugherty for alternate, but he declined in favor of O. G. Smith of Buffalo county, who was nominated by John T. Mallalieu and elected by acclamation.  C. B. Dempster of Gage county, L. P. Judd of Boone county and A. C. Wight of Cass county were then placed in nomination.  A motion to elect Mr. Judd and Mr. Dempster by acclamation prevailed, and another motion included Mr. Wright in the program.  They were declared elected at the moment when the committee on resolutions appeared with their report.</p>

                            <p>In behalf of the committee, Senator Thurston read the following:</p>
                            <p>The republicans of Nebraska in convention assembled congratulate the country upon the certain return of the republican party to power, and rejoice that our land is to be speedily redeemed from the disasters and sufferings of democratic incompetence, error and misrule.</p>
                            <p>This is the year of the people, and the people demand that their great champion, William McKinley, shall be nominated and elected president of the United States.</p>
                            <p>We reaffirm our loyalty to the declared principles of the republican party and to those great American policies for which our party always stands.</p>
                            <p>We pledge ourselves in advance to the platform of the forthcoming republican national convention, believing that it will declare against the free and unlimited coinage of silver and for a currency of gold, silver and paper "as sound as the government and as untarnished as its honor," and for that American system of protection and reciprocity of which William McKinley is the best living exponent and under which out people attained the greatest national and individual prosperity.</p>
                            <p>We assert that the republican party stands for the supremacy of the constitution of the United States; the maintenance of law and order; the protection of every American citizen in his right to live, to labor and to vote; a vigorous foreign policy; the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine; the restoration of our merchant marine; American markets for American products; the governmental supervision and control of transportation lines and rates; the protection of the people from all unlawful combination and unjust exaction of aggregated capital and corporate power; a pension policy just and generous to our living heroes and the widows and orphans of their dead comrades; coast defenses against foreign navies, pauper immigration and the products of cheap foreign labor; a rigid observance of our naturalization laws; the expenditure of all moneys collected from the people for public uses and under direction of public officials.</p>
                            <p>We extend our sympathies to the struggling patriots of Cuba in their heroic efforts to establish a government of the people, and we demand the recognition of their rights as belligerents by the national administration.</p>
                            <p>We remit all presentation of state issues to the convention called for the nomination of state officers, pledging ourselves to support its nominees, and assuring the country that Nebraska is a republican state.</p>

                            <p>W. J. Connell of Omaha offered the following substitute for the money plank as recommended by the committee:</p>
                            <p>We declare that both gold and silver should be primary money and recognized as such by the government of the United States, and should be a full legal tender for all debts, both public and private; that the governments should not discriminate in favor of gold as against silver, and that the mints should be opened upon equal terms to both gold and silver at the ratio now established by law.  We oppose the issuing of government bonds in times of peace.</p>
                            <p>In support of his substitute Mr. Connell spoke at some length and submitted a petition signed by 450 republicans.</p>
                            <p>Delegate Corbin of Johnson county moved to lay the substitute on the table, and after some further debate the motion prevailed.</p>
                            <p>The same controversy was renewed when Hon. John B. Wright of Lancaster county moved that the anti-free coinage clause in the money plank be stricken out.  He declared that the convention had no right to instruct the national convention, and the republican party could not afford to declare for the elimination of either gold or silver as a basis of money.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Crounse declared that the free coinage clause was the only part of the plank that meant anything.  The remainder consisted of glittering generalities on which any one might ride.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Lambertson of Lancaster county made a vigorous appeal for an out and out declaration against free coinage.  He said that Connell was standing exactly where Bryan stood.  Other republican state conventions had declared for sound money, and Nebraska should not be silent.</p>
                            <p>A. E. Brown of Lancaster county quoted a resolution offered in the United States senate by McKinley in 1878 as evidence that McKinley was for silver.</p>
                            <p>Judge Allen W. Field asserted that McKinley had carried Ohio against a party that had declared for the free and unlimited coinage of silver by more than 170,000 majority.</p>
                            <p>The motion to strike out was lost by an overwhelming vote, and the platform as submitted by the committee was unanimously approved.</p>

                            <p>The following resolutions were presented by the committee and adopted without debate:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Delegates representing the twenty-four states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river at the Transmississippi congress of 1895 adopted resolutions providing for the holding of an exposition for the purpose of exhibiting the products, manufactures, arts, industries and capabilities of these states and territories; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The said congress voted unanimously that said exposition should be held at the city of Omaha in the year 1898; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The common interest of the states and territories constituting this great region will be greatly promoted and benefited thereby, and the interests of the great state of Nebraska will be especially benefited by such an exposition within her borders; therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, by the 1,057 citizens of the state of Nebraska, assembled together as delegates to the Nebraska republican state convention in the Coliseum building.  Omaha, April 15, 1896, That the holding of said Transmississippi and International exposition is hereby heartily approved, and that the senators and representatives in congress from Nebraska are requested to fully co-operate with the senators and representatives from the other transmississippi states, and thoroughly and actively endeavor to procure at this session of congress the passage of the bill giving national recognition to said exposition, and providing for an appropriation for national exhibits and the necessary and proper buildings to contain the same; and be it further</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That a copy of the foregoing resolution be certified by the secretary of the convention and sent to the senators and representatives in congress from Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston then presented for approval the resolutions which were adopted by the Douglas county convention as the result of the compromise between the McKinley and Manderson committees some weeks ago.</p>
                            <p>The senator prefaced the reading of these resolutions by an explanation of the circumstances which had led to their conception.  This was largely a repetition of the same ideas which he had expressed on previous occasions, but he included a reference to the resolutions introduced by ex-Governor Crounse earlier in the evening.  He denied that his championship of the cause of William McKinley in Nebraska was associated with any personal ambition.  He denied that he had any desire or expectation to be vice president, and declared that if Nebraska should be fortunate enough to be offered a cabinet position he would not accept it for himself, but would turn it over to one of the many worthy republicans of the commonwealth.</p>

                            <p>After Senator Thurston had read the resolutions Frank Collins of Lancaster county offered the following substitute:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The republican party of Nebraska, in state convention assembled, believes in the rule of the majority and recognizes that the overwhelming sentiment of Nebraska republicans is favorable to the candidacy of William McKinley of Ohio for president of the United States, therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, by this convention, That we heartily commend the candidacy of William McKinley for nomination by the national republican convention to the highest office in the gift of the American people, because of his spotless private life, his sterling honesty, his undoubted political integrity, his high moral courage, his lofty patriotism, his splendid citizenship and his superb statesmanship.  We unqualifiedly endorse his candidacy because he is the acknowledged champion of the overshadowing issue: "American markets for American producers, protection to American industries and American labor."</p>
                            <p>We regard him as the logical and invincible leader of the republican hosts in their victorious campaign of 1896, and triumphal re-entry into power on March 4, 1897.  Be it further,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, by this convention, That the four delegates-at-large and the four alternates-at-large selected by this convention to represent this commonwealth at the national republican convention at St. Louis, be, and each of them, is hereby instructed to use all honorable means to secure the nomination of William McKinley at the hands of said convention, and to this end they, and each of them, are further instructed to vote for William McKinley on the first ballot, and on each succeeding ballot until he is nominated or his name is withdrawn from the contest.</p>
                            <p>In support of his substitute Mr. Collins asked for whom the delegates for the various counties had been instructed.  For McKinley and no one else.  He appealed to them to remain true to their instructions.</p>
                            <p>John L. McPheeley appealed to the convention to stand by Thurston in this matter as he had earned the right to be heeded.</p>
                            <p>The roll call on Collin's substitute resulted:  Ayes, 488; nays, 410.</p>
                            <p>It was declared carried and C. E. Holland of Seward county offered a balm to Senator Thurston in the following, which was unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That in the person of Senator John M. Thurston we recognize an able statesman whose only ambition is to promote the best interests of his constituents and to stand between any foe, political or otherwise, that endangers their prosperity or attempts to throttle the popular expression of the people on any political question.  Undaunted by any political power, he has the courage to voice the sentiments of the sovereign people on any question of moment in the face of any organized opposition.</p>
                            <p>On motion of Seth Mobley of Grand Island, a vote of thanks was tendered to Chairman McCreary for his services, and the convention adjourned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ALLISON'S INTEREST JUST AROUSED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Chairman of the Senate Committee Gives Assurance of His Willingness to Advocate a Greater Appropriation.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 17.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Chairman Dingley of the house ways and means committee, after an extended conference with President Wattles of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association, has set apart Monday morning for a hearing on the senate bill.  This result has not been accompanied without considerable hard work on the part of Messrs. Wattles and Mercer, who have rounded up matters to such an extent that a favorable result is almost certain.  Before holding his conference with Chairman Dingley the president of the exposition had a long conference with Chairman Allison of the senate appropriations committee, to whom he explained in minute detail the plans and purposes of the exposition.  He showed Mr. Allison that $250,000 would have to be appropriated by the United States before the exposition could realize any portion of the $10,000 appropriated by the Iowa legislature for preliminary work on the Iowa building.  This was news to the senior senator from Iowa, who had no conception of the magnitude which the exposition is assuming.  After going over the subject very fully Mr. Allison gave Mr. Wattles assurance that he would favor an amendment increasing the amount of the appropriation to $250,000, suggesting that $75,000 be appropriated for buildings and $175,000 for the government exhibit and expenses attaching thereto.</p>
                            <p>This strong show of friendliness on the part of Senator Allison for the bill acted as a tonic upon the spirits of President Wattles, who for a time was at a loss to know just exactly what was best to be done in view of the complicated situation.  After this conference with Allison it was comparatively easy to make headway with Chairman Dingley, who finally agreed to make the senate exposition bill a special order before the committee for Monday morning.  President Wattles will go before the full committee on that occasion, and will put before it the plan and scope of the enterprise, which is broader and more comprehensive than the Atlanta exposition.  He will fortify himself with the Iowa bill appropriating the amount above named and considerable other material for which he has telegraphed.  Chairman Dingley is not averse, according to Wattles, to increasing the appropriation carried by the bill.  He still holds out, however, for a stipulated amount to be raised by the people of Omaha and the west before the government appropriation becomes available, and it is thought $250,000 will be named as the sum to be raised by the exposition association, to be passed upon by the secretary of the treasury.  Thus the atmosphere has cleared considerably in the last twenty-four hours regarding the fate of the exposition bill.  President Wattles tonight is more hopeful than at any time during his visit here.  Thurston is expected to arrive Monday and at once to put his shoulder to the wheel.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska will be represented in Washington next week by a number of its strongest lawyers.  John M. Woolworth will be here for the Omaha bridge cases will be reached on Tuesday.  Ex-Senator Manderson will also be here to argue the sugar bounty cases, and there will be several lesser legal lights present who will have business before the supreme court and departments.  Three briefs have been filed in the Omaha bridge cases, John F. Dillon and John M. Thurston for the appellants; J. M. Woolworth files another as solicitor for the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific, he having as his associates M. A. Law and Robert Mather, while George R. Peck and Burton Hansen have presented a brief for the Milwaukee.  By agreement of counsel, both cases will be argued and submitted as one.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Thurston's Advice Regarding Legislation for the Exposition.</head>
                            <head type="sub">LETTER SENT TO SECRETARY WAKEFIELD</head>
                            <head type="sub">Thinks it Would Be Dangerous to Attempt a Course Different from that Which Has Been Commenced.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday Senator Thurston sent a letter to Secretary Wakefield of the Transmississippi and International Exposition company.  The communication explains itself, and is as follows:</p>
                            <p>"Telegrams received yesterday from Senator Allen seem to demand that I should once more state to you, and through you to your organization, what we believe to be the congressional situation.</p>
                            <p>"From the very outset I urged the exposition officials to moderate their present demands for congressional action to correspond with what was done for the Atlanta exposition.  I have never changed in my belief as originally expressed, that we could secure the same aid without serious opposition, and that we could secure nothing more from the present congress.  I also insisted that it was not wise to ask this congress to make any greater present appropriation of money than would be necessary for expenditures in the way of commencing the government building prior to July 1, 1897.  The bill being passed, appropriations would follow at succeeding sessions of congress, as needed, without the slightest difficulty, as appropriations are always made, as a matter of course, to carry out the provisions of existing laws.</p>
                            <p>"Senator Allen and myself, early in January, canvassed the congressional situation very carefully.  Our views have coincided throughout; we have worked together and co-operated together in every respect, and we are all indebted to Senator Allen for the interest he has taken in the exposition legislation and the work he has done to secure it.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HANDLING THE BILL.</head>
                            <p>"I was advised by your managers that you felt confident of securing a very large appropriation in the house of representatives, and it was upon such representations, and not because we believed that any such great present appropriations could be secured that Senator Allen and myself decided to hold the senate bill as long as we could with safety to await the action on the house bill.  With this end in view I secured a unanimous report of my committee in favor of the senate bill and had the bill placed on the calendar with the accompanying report nearly two months since.  We carefully canvassed both sides of the senate and succeeded in removing all opposition to our bill, and had it in a position to pass at any time.  We held it waiting for action in the house just as long as we dared, Senator Allen being very pronounced in his views that further delay in the senate would jeopardize the chances of legislation, and no action being taken in the house, and so far as we could see there being no immediate prospect of any action in the house, we got our bill up last Friday and passed it by unanimous consent.</p>
                            <p>"This bill gives to your exposition the same aid as was extended to the Atlanta exposition, $200,000 for government building and exhibit.  We had the assurance that if the senate bill could be speedily passed, whatever immediate appropriation was necessary would be placed upon the sundry civil appropriation bill, and there is no question but what such immediate appropriation would be followed next winter with further appropriations as needed.</p>
                            <p>"I do not know what you have been led to expect in the way of success in the house of representatives, but urgent dispatches from Senator Allen confirm my judgment, that unless your people immediately unite and urge the passage of the senate bill without any amendment you will seriously endanger and probably defeat any legislation at this session.  It is absolutely dangerous to attempt to amend the senate bill at this late day in the session.</p>
                            </div3>  
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PERILOUS TO ATTEMPT MORE.</head>
                            <p>"With this plain statement of the case, if your managers see fit to take the responsibility of action different from what is advised by Senator Allen and myself, the responsibility will be upon you.  We have had your bill well in hand at all times, and its passage practically guaranteed.  We have labored earnestly and industriously to make certain the passage of such legislation as we believed could be put through, and have held out no hope to you of any greater results than will be accomplished by the passage of the senate bill.  So far as I am concerned, I have felt at all times that it was my duty to discourage your expectation of any more favorable legislation at the present time, although I have been fully aware that I have been publicly criticised by members of your organization because I did not hold out to you promises or encouragement of a much greater appropriation than there was any possibility of securing under existing conditions.  It is also true that at one time certain reported political negotiations between your representatives and the people of some other states threatened most seriously the defeat of any legislation at the present session of congress, and under the circumstances I think it has been somewhat surprising that we secured such ready and unanimous support of our senate bill.</p>
                            <p>"If your managers feel certain of securing more favorable action in the house of representatives, then it is self-evident that you have the power to put the senate bill through the house just as it stands.  In the interest of the success of the exposition, I feel it my duty to say to you on behalf of Senator Allen and myself that you should immediately direct your energies to securing the prompt passage of the senate bill without any amendment.  Otherwise you are taking most dangerous and unnecessary risks.</p>
                            <p>"I write this letter from a sense of duty and because there are many people here who seem to think that congress will appropriate any sum of money for the exposition enterprise which its promoters see fit to ask for, whereas it is most difficult, on the eve of a presidential election, to secure any appropriation of any king not absolutely needed to carry on the business of the government."</p>

                            <p>There was a full attendance at the meeting of the Transmississippi exposition directory yesterday in the rooms of the Commercial club.  Mr. Montgomery moved that the press of Omaha be requested to show to the people that the exposition of 1898 is bound to be a greater institution than the expositions of Atlanta or New Orleans.  The motion was seconded by Mr. Bennett and unanimously carried.  A letter was received from Governor W. J. McConnell of Idaho naming B. P. Shawhan of Payette, Idaho, as vice president of the exposition from that state.  A telegram was read from President Wattles in which he stated that he hoped to secure something definite at the hands of the national legislators yesterday.  This appointment was ratified by the directory and the meeting adjourned.</p>

                            <p>FARGO, N. D., April 15.&#8212;The republican state convention just closed in this city was one of the most notable in the history of the state and in most respects it was the most interesting.  The whole northwest has looked to this state with interest and has waited patiently for the result on the silver question and the presidential support.  At the convention today free silver was turned down.  The delegates to the St. Louis convention were instructed to use all honorable means to support McKinley.  The following are the delegates: C. M. Johnson, Richland; A. S. Halson, Traill; S. T. Satterwaite, Cass; J. M. Devine, Lamoure; Alexander Hughes, Burleigh, and J. H. Bingenheimer, Morton.</p>
                            <p>The following is the money plank adopted by the convention: "The republicans of North Dakota, in convention <choice><sic>asembled</sic><corr>assembled</corr></choice>, renew their devotion to the doctrine of protection.  The republicans of North Dakota are unyielding in their demand for honest money.  We are unalterably opposed to any scheme that will give to the country a depreciated or debased currency.  We favor the use of silver as currency, but to the extent only and under such restrictions that its parity with gold can be maintained.  We are therefore opposed to the free and unlimited coinage of silver until it can be arranged by international agreement."</p>

                            <p>WHEREAS, The trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress, composed of leading <del>business</del> men representing all classes of business interest of the states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river, did, at a meeting held during the month of November last, determine that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway, would be of great value, not only to the trans-Mississippi states, but to all homeseekers of the world; and the said trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress, did, by a unanimous vote, wisely select the City of Omaha as the proper location for such exposition, therefore; RESOLVED, By the City Council of the City of Chamberlain, that we heartily approve the action of the trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress, that we consider such an exposition to be of the highest importance to the trans-Mississippi states and territories, of which our own state is not the least, and deem it but just that Congress recognize this enterprise by making such an appropriation as will aid materially in the success of the undertaking, to which end we hereby request that our representatives in congress use their best efforts, toward bringing about such an issue.</p>
                            <p>Adopted April 6th 1896.</p>

                            <p>WHEREAS, That portion of the United States lying west of the Mississippi River, abounds in economic resources of all kinds that are comparatively little known to the world at large; and</p>

                            <head type="sub">An Interesting Suggestion.</head>
                            <p>Omaha, April 18.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald:  Every loyal citizen of Omaha and Nebraska is proud of what has been done in behalf of the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898.  The World-Herald has accomplished wonders in drawing the attention of prominent persons of the whole country to the great trans-Missouri attraction, and thereby getting the people of all sections fully aroused in its behalf.  The officers of the association have accomplished much in the short time they have been to work.  No set of men, we take it, could have done more.  Every bit of machinery necessary to put in motion has been "greased" and the mills are grinding, and before the grass is growing in 1897 there is every assurance and confidence that each state and territory within the trans-Mississippi radius will have made its appropriation to be seen and represented at this "greatest show on earth."</p>
                            <p>Up to date everybody is satisfied with what has been done.  The foundation has been laid, and well laid, and now for the real work&#8212;the work that tries the metal that men are made of&#8212;yes, bi-metal if you please.  It will take "goldbugs" and "silverbugs" both to build an exposition that will make Omaha and Nebraska proud and do imperishable honor to the great states and territories of the trans-Mississippi country.  The plain English of it all is that money must be raised, and lots of it.  And how are we going to do it?  How did Chicago and the state of Illinois do it when the local governments pledged their sacred honor that if the World's fair went to Chicago the American people would have no cause to regret the location.  As I remember the state of Illinois appropriated something like $1,000,000 for a building and a state exhibit, while the city of Chicago and Cook county voted $5,000,000 in bonds.  Independent of this money wealthy citizens of Chicago subscribed stock aggregating thousands of dollars.  All this was done to launch the great Columbian exposition in 1893&#8212;the greatest panorama of landscape and architectural beauty the world has ever seen, to say nothing of the art and mechanical exhibits under cover of the colossal structures.  The liberality of Chicago and of Illinois surprised the nation and the states vied with each other in erecting buildings and making state exhibits.</p>
                            <p>In order to be brief let me ask "what Omaha and Nebraska expect to do to make the exposition of 1898 a success?"  As yet no requisition has been made, but the time is near at hand when one will be made, but how much no one knows, but for not less than a half million dollars it is safe to predict.  And how can it be raised?  Some will say "by subscription."  I say it can't be done.  Then "how shall it be raised?" will be the inquiry.  My idea is by taxation.  Let the state legislature appropriate $200,000 for the occasion and as for Omaha and Douglas county bonds to the amount of $300,000 can be pledged.  In my judgment this will be the easiest and most equitable method of raising the necessary funds.</p>
                            <p>Every taxpayer in Nebraska is interested in the exposition, and his interest in dollars and cents is measured by the amount of property he owns.  Therefore, let each person pay according to his "means."  Somebody has got to foot the bills for this coming big show and as our people are all poor these dull times, we can easily make a loan by voting a tax, whereas if we are called upon for spot cash there will be a vigorous kick on all sides and the dashboard is liable to be knocked off the trans-Mississippi vehicle and somebody in the front seat will get hurt.  The exposition of 1898 is an assured success if Douglas county and Nebraska will do their whole duty.  If they fail in this the exposition will be a failure, too.  Yours for the success of the exhibition.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Dolliver of Iowa today made the report of the ways and means committee on the Omaha exposition bill, with the amendment requiring a bona fide subscription of $250,000 by the stockholders as a precedent for making available the money provided by the government appropriation, as per the senate bill, which is favorably reported.  He said:</p>
                            <p>"Twenty-four states and territories are vitally interested in this enterprise, each of which has given assurances that it will make an exhibit and an appropriation in order that the exposition may be a great success.  The government has encouraged expositions of similar character at New Orleans and Atlanta, while government aid has been extended to some lesser affairs in other parts of the country.  We are assured that this exposition will be on a larger scale than the one lately held at Atlanta and will be of special benefit to the trans-Mississippi country.  It has been urged on the committee by friends of the exposition, including members of the house, that the amount should be increased to $250,000, in order that the enterprise might be of a character commensurate with the greatness of the trans-Mississippi country, but while conceding the full force of this contention, in view of the deplorable condition of the treasury and the significance of the fact that the senate in passing the bill without division or objection, reduced the amount from the $250,000 provided by the bill originally to $200,000, we do not feel justified in raising the amount to $250,000.  The amendment, proposed by the committee, will insure a definite subscription or appropriation on the part of the exposition before any money, provided by the government, shall be available."</p>

                            <p>Washington, D. C., April 20.&#8212;The ways and means committee today ordered a favorable report on the bill of Mr. Mercer of Nebraska to aid the Transmississippi and International exposition at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The bill appropriates $200,000 for a government building and exhibit, but requires the exposition company to raise $250,000 before the government allotment is made available.</p>
                            <p>G. C. Wattles, president of the Exposition, and Representative Mercer of Nebraska addressed the committee on the measure just before it was ordered reported.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles wires the World-Herald thus:</p>
                            <p>"Washington, D. C., April 20.&#8212;We presented the exposition bills to the ways and means committee this morning.  We urged an increase of the amount named in the senate bill with all force possible, by Mercer and myself.</p>
                            <p>"On account of the economy necessary in all legislation at this time the committee voted to recommend the senate bill unchanged as to amount.  Dingley insisted on attaching an amendment providing that we must satisfy the secretary of the treasury that we have $250,000 raised before any money can be expended by the government.  It was attached to the senate bill.  Dolliver made a strong plea for an increase, but it was voted down.  We did the very best we could under all adverse circumstances."</p>

                            <head type="sub">WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE WON OVER</head>
                            <head type="sub">Senate Bill for the Big Transmississippi Fair Agreed to by Chairman Dingley and Will Be Passed by the House.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 20.&#8212;(Special Telegram).&#8212;The Transmississippi and International exposition project is now an assured certainty as far as congressional aid is concerned.  The ways and means committee has agreed to the senate bill, making a few amendments which will in nowise hamper the work of the managers of the enterprise, and has instructed Congressman Dolliver of Iowa to make a favorable report to the house.  That the bill will pass is almost a foregone conclusion.</p>
                            <p>The success achieved by the promoters of the enterprise has been reached only after a hard fight&#8212;not so much against opposition as against a lack of knowledge of the project and of the almost unanimous desire of the states and territories of the transmississippi country to see it carried into execution.  As soon as the members of the ways and means committee understood the magnitude of the project and the desire of the west for its success all opposition vanished and a unanimous report in favor of the bill is the result.</p>
                            <p>The ways and means committee met at 10 o'clock today for the purpose of taking up consideration of the bill for the promotion of the exhibit already passed by the senate.  President Wattles of Omaha was invited to appear before the committee, and did so.  He spoke at length upon the magnitude of the enterprise, quoted many facts and figures to show the rapid progress and development of the transmississippi states and territories, and explained the purpose of the citizens of Omaha to work unitedly for the success of the enterprise.  President Wattles laid especial stress upon the fact that the Transmississippi exposition was not a local enterprise, conceived in the minds of the citizens of Omaha for the pecuniary benefit of Omaha alone.  He reviewed the history of the project, showing how it had been conceived by delegates in attendance upon the Transmississippi congress, which assembled in Omaha a few months ago, with representatives from every state and territory west of the Mississippi river.  He laid before the committee a large mass of documentary evidence, consisting of resolutions from commercial bodies, boards of trade, societies, and memorials from state legislatures, all supporting the project and urging congressional action.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Dave Mercer was also given time for a brief address upon the merits of the enterprise, and he talked with his usual characteristic energy.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of the arguments the committee went into executive session.  The session was brief and decisive.  Congressman Dolliver of Iowa was instructed to make an immediate and favorable report upon the bill which has already passed the senate.</p>
                            <p>The committee made but one amendment to the bill.  Section 5 is so amended as to provide that no liability against the government shall be incurred, and no expenditure of money under the act shall be made, until the officers of the exposition shall have furnished to the secretary of the treasury proof to his satisfaction that there have been obtained by the exposition corporation subscriptions, donations or appropriations from all sources, for the purposes of the exposition, a sum aggregating not less than $250,000.</p>
                            <p>The bill will have plain sailing from this time forward.  The committee on rules will arrange for its proper presentation, and will facilitate its passage through the house.  Speaker Reed will consent to an early consideration, and the senate will, beyond a question of doubt, agree to the house amendment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HURRAH FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>The action of the committee on ways and means of the house of representatives in favorably reporting the senate bill for the Trans-Mississippi exposition practically assures the holding of the great show at Omaha from July to November, 1898.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles may well congratulate himself upon the success of his Washington trip.  It is true the committee was not willing to grant all that he asked, but it is also true that the bill in its amended shape, with its excellent chances of passage, concedes all that is actually necessary to the success of the exposition, and is really all that we could reasonably expect from congress at this time.</p>
                            <p>As Chairman Dingley has said with force and truth, congress is going far in the direction of patronage and public spirit when it endows an enterprise like the Trans-Mississippi exposition with $200,000 of the public money before the people immediately interested have subscribed sufficient support to the enterprise to insure its success.</p>
                            <p>Up to the present time only a few thousand dollars have been subscribed to capital stock of the enterprise, and with this fact in view it is remarkable that we have been able to make such progress as has been made in Iowa, in other western states and in congress.</p>
                            <p>The bill which congress will pass will appropriate $200,000 for the government exhibit upon condition that we raise at least a quarter of a million dollars ourselves.  This is proper.  We must raise a quarter of a million dollars and we must raise very much more than that amount.  We might as well face the proposition now as later.  This is a great enterprise upon which we are embarked.  It promises vast results and it also calls for considerable sacrifice.  We must not only raise a quarter of a million dollars here among ourselves in the west, but it is probably that before the project reaches maturity we must raise, all told, three times that amount.  This is no petty enterprise.  It is a vast undertaking and it must be carried forward with breadth of view and liberality.</p>
                            <p>The people of Omaha must realize now, if they have never realized before, that they are face to face with a great undertaking&#8212;a national affair&#8212;one which has itself splendid possibilities of Omaha.  To get the true value and utmost benefit out of it for the city, we must bend every energy to it and exhaust all our resources in promoting it.  Then, when we reap the harvest we will find that it is a rich one.</p>
                            <p>The preliminary work has now been almost completed.  Most of the western states in the trans-Mississippi region have been aroused.  Some have acted.  The machinery of congress has been set in motion.  The time has now arrived for organization at home.  Every man must put his shoulder to the wheel and this town must be raked from one end to the other and the same degree of public spirit must be aroused among <choice><sic>out</sic><corr>our</corr></choice> people as was aroused in Chicago in securing subscriptions among all classes&#8212;the poor as well as the rich&#8212;the stingy as well as the liberal.</p>

                            <p>Washington, D. C., April 20.&#8212;The full text of the argument made by President Wattles of the Trans-Mississippi exposition before the house committee on ways and means was as follows:</p>
                            <p>Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: The Trans-Mississippi and International exposition was proposed by the trans-Mississippi congress by a resolution, which passed that body by unanimous vote at their last session, which was held at Omaha in November, 1895.  The trans-Mississippi congress is an organization composed of delegates appointed by the governors of states, mayors of cities and by commercial organizations throughout the trans-Mississippi country.  It meets annually to discuss measures of importance to the growth and prosperity of the west.  It is a representative body of the best men in business and politics in the west.  The arguments in favor of this exposition brought out the fact that the tide of immigration which has steadily flowed westward for a century was ebbing; that the great depression in business during the last few years, coupled with the partial failure of crops in some of the western states and the activity of other sections of the country in advertising their resources, was liable to show at the next census for the first time in fifty years that the center of population had moved eastward.  It was argued that an exposition of the character proposed would counteract these influences and by advertising in a fitting manner the resources of the west and educating the people of our country and of the world in the variety and magnitude of these resources this exposition would result in lasting benefits, not only to the west, but to the entire country.</p>
                            <p>Omaha was selected as the place for the exposition on account of its convenient location and numerous railroad connections.  Our citizens appreciate the burden that has been placed upon them, but have assumed it with their characteristic enterprise.  A corporation with an authorized capital of $1,000,000 has been formed and much preliminary work has been done.  It was early decided that without the recognition of the general government and its participation the exposition could not assume the magnitude and influence its projectors had designed, hence one of the first steps that was taken was the introduction by our senators and representatives of bills to secure this recognition and participation.  These bills are now pending before your honorable body.  As the time for holding this exposition has been fixed for 1898 one of these bills must pass at this session of congress or the exposition must be abandoned.  A bill has passed the senate which only differs from the house bill in the amount of the limit to be expended by the government.  The senate bill when introduced fixed this limit at $250,000, but was amended on its passage by reducing this limit to $200,000.  At this exposition only $50,000 was appropriated for a building, but in addition the government building at the World's fair at Chicago was donated and the appropriation was simply used in removing it to Atlanta.  Besides the Atlanta exposition was participated in by only a part of the southern states, while the Trans-Mississippi exposition is for the entire country west of the Mississippi river, comprising twenty-four states and territories and covering nearly two-thirds of the entire area of the United States, whose inhabitants number nearly one-third the population and possess nearly half the wealth of the nation.  In this territory there are 73,960 miles of railroad.  The government owns millions of acres of unoccupied lands and has expended hundreds of millions of dollars in buildings, railroads, improvement of its rivers and other agencies to develop this great country which but a few years ago was marked on our maps as the great American desert, but which now furnishes homes for nearly 20,000,000 of our population.  Embraced within this territory is every variety of soil and climate.  We not only produce a large part of the grain and meat consumed in this country, but locked within the bosom of our mountains is untold mineral wealth, only waiting the developing agencies of civilization to furnish prosperity and riches to millions yet to be.  The oil fields of Wyoming, the mountains of coal and iron of Utah, the wonderful mines of gold and silver in South Dakota, Colorado, California and other of our states have been heard of, but a great majority of the people of our own country even do not appreciate their extent.  In my own state we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the production of sugar from beets.  Already two large factories are in successful operation, but there is room for a hundred more, and ample opportunity in the west to produce all the sugar for which this nation now pays foreign countries more than $100,000,000 annually.  It is to educate our own people regarding these resources of a part of their own country and to advertise them to the world that we propose to hold this great exposition.  Surely an exposition of the resources and civilization of this great empire of states should not be classed as a local affair, and no <choice><sic>matted</sic><corr>matter</corr></choice> how depleted the treasury, should command proper recognition from congress.</p>
                            <p>The senate bill fixing the limit of $250,000 was introduced before the full needs and magnitude of the enterprise were fully appreciated even by those most active in the matter.  Since then the only two western states whose legislatures have convened (Iowa and Utah) have passed joint resolutions favoring the exposition.  Iowa has passed an appropriation for preliminary expenses of her exhibit, conditioned, however, as I understand, on the passage of a bill by this congress authorizing an expenditure by the government of at least $250,000.  If you will read the petitions and resolutions favoring this measure that have been presented to congress from states, cities and commercial bodies from all over the west you will appreciate to some extent the enthusiasm which the proposition to hold this exposition has aroused.  They come from Iowa to California and from North Dakota to Texas, and all ask liberal and prompt action by congress.  We believe that the house bill providing for a limit of $500,000 to be expended by the government should be recommended by your honorable committee, but we realize that this session of congress is drawing to a close and that any bill must have the indorsement of your entire committee to secure its passage.  If the house bill does not command such an indorsement then we urge you to so amend the senate bill as to restore the original amount asked, $75,000 for building and $175,000 for an exhibit, and speedily report it to the house.  We have no objections to such further amendments as you may deem proper requiring a specific amount to be raised by our people before the government shall be called upon to expend any of the money provided in this act.</p>
                            <p>I thank you, gentlemen, for this hearing and for your attention.</p>

                            <head type="sub">President Wattles Tells of the Obstacles Met in Gaining the Appropriation.</head>
                            <head type="sub">He Feels That All Things Considered the Exposition and the Government Have Both Been Well Cared For.</head>
                            <p>G. W. Wattles, president of the board of directors of the Transmississippi exposition, returned yesterday from his trip to Washington, where he went in the interest of the exposition bill.</p>
                            <p>He said the outlook for the bill was very dark when he first arrived in Washington, and the first obstacle he met was the statement that the government was borrowing money at 3 per cent to pay its running expenses, and that it was not considered good business under those conditions to appropriate money for an exposition which was not a necessary institution.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Dingley told him that if the times were as good as they were a few years ago there would have been no trouble in getting an appropriation of $1,000,000 for the enterprise, as the government had a few years ago given $1,600,000 for the exposition at New Orleans.</p>
                            <p>Another barrier to the success of the larger appropriation was the feeling among the members of congress from the east and south that the exposition was to be something of the magnitude of the one at Atlanta, whereas there is every indication that it will greatly exceed that exposition.  The Atlanta exposition was under the patronage of only eight states, while the Transmississippi exposition has twenty-four states back of it, and all of them heartily in favor of it.  It will be second only to the exposition at Chicago in 1893, and as soon as this fact is made clear to congress further appropriations may easily follow.</p>
                            <p>The ways and means committee told Mr. Wattles that it would not for a moment consider an appropriation which was not hedged about with suitable safeguards to protect the government, and for that reason the provision was attached to the bill making it incumbent upon the city of Omaha, before the government appropriation can be used, to subscribe $250,000 toward the capital stock of the exposition company, or in donations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles thinks there is now little doubt that the bill in its present shape will pass congress, and under all conditions, he thinks the exposition has secured all it could get, and in the only way that it could be had, and is thankful it got that much.</p>

                            <head type="sub">They Talk Over the Exposition With Mr. Wattles.</head>
                            <p>The regular meeting of the Omaha Retailers' association last evening at the Commercial club rooms was largely devoted to getting up steam for the Trans-Mississippi exposition project.  Intense enthusiasm was aroused by the addresses.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Guerdon W. Wattles spoke of his trip to Washington, of the results already secured in the form of a $200,000 government appropriation and of that which is necessary for Omaha yet to do, especially to build a union depot.  His talk upon the depot question was taken up by succeeding speakers.</p>
                            <p>Judge C. R. Scott believed that the citizens of Omaha could well afford to give one-half of their property for the exposition, for all that would be left, the exposition once secured, would be worth more than the whole amount at present.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Edward Rosewater dwelt at length upon the magnitude of the enterprise, stating that it embraced twenty-four states, more than two-thirds of the area and nearly one-half of the wealth of the United States, and that there would be spent in Omaha upon the completion of the exposition not less than from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000.</p>
                            <p>The concluding speaker, Mr. G. M. Hitchcock, brought out particularly the benefits that would accrue to Omaha in the event of a successful exposition, such as increased property values, increased population, and an impetus to business that would last through the exposition and become permanent.</p>
                            <p>Previous to the addresses, Mr. W. O. Beatty, chairman of the insurance investigation committee, reported that the committee and the insurance companies were approaching a basis on which they could agree on lower rates of insurance in such a manner that benefits would <choice><sic>acrue</sic><corr>accrue</corr></choice> all around, and that the investigations would be carried further.</p>

                            <p>C. J. Smyth introduced resolutions indorsing the Trans-Mississippi exposition, which were adopted.</p>
                            <p>The resolutions are as follows:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Delegates representing the twenty-four states and territories west of the Mississippi river at the trans-Mississippi congress of 1895 adopted resolutions providing for the holding of an exposition for the purpose of exhibiting the products, manufactures, arts, industries and capabilities of those states and territories, and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The said congress voted unanimously that said exposition should be held at the city of Omaha, in the year 1898, and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The common interests of the states and territories constituting this great region will be greatly promoted and benefited thereby, and the great state of Nebraska will be especially benefited by such an exposition within her borders; therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, By the 800 citizens of the state of Nebraska, assembled together as delegates to the Nebraska democratic state convention, held in the Funke opera house, at Lincoln, Neb., on April 22, A.

                            <head type="sub">Typographical Union Protests Against C. L. U. Censuring President Fisher&#8212;General Labor Notes.</head>
                            <p>It is a subject of much self-gratulation among some workingmen of this city.  It is the sole topic of discussion when workingmen get together to learn of matters which are encouraging to them.  It is a well settled opinion that Omaha workingmen will profit by it.  It is looked forward to by them with the greatest anticipation of enjoyment coupled with pecuniary profit.  To the workingmen it is the embodiment of hope, pleasure, happiness, comfort and prosperity.  It is to them the epitome of all greatness and their hopes are to be realized.  "It" is the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi exposition is already bringing about a revival among the trades.  From every grade and class come statements of increasing demand for workingmen, a stiffening of prices for labor and a corresponding decrease of the gloom which has for a year past pervaded labor circles.</p>
                            <p>The carpenters are already beginning to have plenty of work, not only in small repairs, but in the building of dwellings, some of which are being erected in expectation of the demand to be created during the exposition.  It is the prevailing belief that Omaha workingmen will be given the preference on the buildings which will have to be erected to accommodate the exhibits and exhibitors at the coming exposition.</p>
                            <p>The work itself is considered as a matter of the greatest importance to Omaha, because all classes of trades will have to furnish the material or do the work of preparing for the great show.</p>
                            <p>The upholsterers and mattress makers report that a considerable demand has already been made upon them for their products by prospective boarding house and hotel keepers, and they expect to reap a rich harvest as a result of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The iron workers, the chair factories, the wood working establishments, and store keepers in all lines are preparing to provide for the great demand which it is expected by them will be made upon their work and stocks.</p>
                            <p>And all Omaha smiles.</p>

                        </div2>
                        <div2 type="article">
                            <p>Mr. Andreesen of Lee-Clarke-Andreesen Hardware company&#8212;It is a good thing for Omaha and for the whole west.  And coming with our good crops makes us feel still better.  Business will be better from this time forward.</p>
                            <p>Isaac Carpenter of the Carpenter Paper company&#8212;It is one of the best and greatest things which could happen, not only in Nebraska, but to all the trans-Mississippi states.  California, where I spent several weeks recently, is preparing to lead all states in its exhibit, and I am satisfied all of the states will come forward in good shape.  There will not be any trouble in complying with the provision of the bill requiring the local association to raise $200,000.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Utt of the Commercial club&#8212;It is the greatest event in the history of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>John R. Webster of the Omaha Bridge and Terminal Railway company&#8212;Magnificent.  The passage of the bill will have a great influence favorable to the building of a union depot.  The railroads will realize that they must provide facilities to handle the exposition visitors.</p>
                            <p>A. B. DeLong of the East Omaha Land company&#8212;One of the best things for the general interests of Omaha, and the west as a whole, which could possibly occur.</p>
                            <p>H. T. Clarke&#8212;It is the forerunner of better times.  It will bring many people from the east and after getting out here they will find they want some of the west.  In the forty odd years I have been in Nebraska there has never been a time I have been more sanguine of the future, nor has there ever been a better time to invest.</p>
                            <p>C. W. Lyman of the Commercial National bank&#8212;It will bring a great many people to Omaha, will advertise the west in a very effective manner, and doubtless some of those who come will invest.</p>

                            <l>Dear sir:--</l>
                            <p>I take great pleasure in advising you that the Directors of this Club, at a recent meeting, passed the following resolutions:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, the late Trans-Mississippi Congress, composed of delegates fromm twenty-four states and territories, lying west of the Mississppi River, adopted a resolution providing for holding an exposition to display the products, manufacturies and industries of these states and territories at Omaha, Neb., in the year of 1898, and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, the holding of such exposition must greatly benefit the state of Missouri and especially St. Joseph, and other cities and towns adjacent thereto, therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, by the Commercial Club of St. Joseph, that the holding of the said Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha is hereby approved and that our Representative and Senators in Congress be requested to co-operate with the Senators and Representatives from Nebraska in procuring the passage at the present session of Congress a bill giving national recognition of said exposition and providing for an appropriation for national exhibits and the necessary buildings to contain the same.  And be it further</p>
                            <p>Resolved, that a copy of the foregoing by furnished the Senators from Missouri and the Hon. George C. Crowthers, Congressman.</p>
                            <p>I have also carried out the part to <choice><sic>not fy</sic><corr>notify</corr></choice> the representatives in Washington, and Senator Vest advises me that such a bill has already been passed by the Senate.  Congressman Crowthers also advises that he will do all in his power to hurry a similar bill thro' his branch of Congress.</p>
                            <ab>Yours truly,</ab>

                            <p>William R. Bennett, of Omaha, was a pleasant caller at The Boomerang office this morning.  He arrived in the city this morning, accompanying his wife and child this far on their way to California.  They will rest here today and Mrs. Bennett will continue west tomorrow morning, while Mr. Bennett will return to Omaha.  Mr. Bennett is one of the directors of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, and is also president of the Omaha Fair and Speed association.  In speaking of the exposition this <choice><sic>mornig</sic><corr>morning</corr></choice> Mr. Bennett said:</p>
                            <p>"I was greatly delighted with our trip west through here recently when we visited Salt Lake in the interest of the exposition.  We did not have an opportunity to stop at Laramie then, so I accepted this opportunity to visit Laramie.  The exposition, of course, is the main thing with us in Omaha now.  It is in a sense an undertaking that was thrust upon Omaha, but one which we undertake with a great deal of pleasure and great expectation.  You know the Trans-Mississippi Commercial congress held their last meeting in Omaha and then decided to hold an exposition somewhere in this western country.  Omaha has undertaken the fulfillment of that resolution.  We are beginning to look upon the fair as a certainty.  A bill appropriating $200,000 has already been passed by the senate and has been favorably reported by the house committee, and we are quite sure of its progress.  At the next session of congress we expect a still better appropriation.  A million dollars will be spent in the erection of the main exposition buildings <choice><sic>an d</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> in beautifying the grounds.  In addition to this the fourteen states will probably erect state buildings.  The exposition will be of greater magnitude than either the Atlanta or the Tennessee exposition.</p>
                            <p>"So far we have received every encouragement from the western states.  Laramie, for instance, will want to show to the world her mineral riches and her natural facilities for manufacturing glass, your soda and all the other various resources.  As the exposition is to be made international it will be the great opportunity of the western states to state their cases to the world.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bennett, who is also the president of the Omaha Fair and Speed association, says the summer meeting will be held there on the 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13th of June, and that $20,000 will be offered in purses.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;A renewed effort will be made during the coming week to advance the Omaha exposition bill.  It is understood here that several influential citizens of Omaha will be on the ground to assist the Nebraska delegation in advancing the bill.  It will be recalled that Chicago had just such an experience in getting its measure before the house after the fight for location was ended in its favor.  Speaker Reed continues to hold out against the measure, and there is a fear that politics is playing no inconsequential part in his opposition.  Should this prove true it would be most unfortunate for the bill, although hardly to be understood by people west of the Mississippi river.  The delegation has not allowed a day to go by during the last week without holding a conference with the speaker and urging him to recognize a member to put the bill on passage.  Representative Mercer has been persistent, but the speaker is as stoical, as silent as the sphinx over the question, and no one can tell what the outcome will be.  Representative Dolliver of Iowa said tonight:  "I have labored with the speaker and have shown him, I believe, the wishes of our people.  Politics should play no part in this matter.  It didn't with Senator Allison; why should it with Speaker Reed?  I cannot say whether recognition will be accorded the bill or not.  I know that the Iowa delegation will vote as a unit for the measure when it is placed on its final passage."</p>
                            <p>The Fort Omaha military bill will come out of the senate committee with a favorable recommendation it is confidently believed.  Senator Shoup, member of the military affairs committee, stated that he was in favor of the bill.  He knew of the depression that existed in all western states, and that the prices of five years ago were in sad contrast to those existing today.  General Manderson has taken interest in the matter and has written a personal letter to each member of the committee, urging the passage of the bill.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ONE BILL SURE OF PASSAGE.</head>
                            <p>A number of senators were discussing the probability of President Cleveland vetoing the river and harbor bill, and the consensus of opinion was that he was sharpening his pen for that very purpose.  "And then what," said Senator McBride of Oregon, who has nearly $20,000,000 worth of interest in the bill.  "Oh, we will pass it over his veto," said Senator Vest, "because nearly every member of congress has got some 'pork' in it.  I have not heard of a single man who has lost a dollar by the disagreement in the two houses.  If there is such a man I should like to know him.  So long as the dump holes for money are provided for, senators and representatives wink the other eye and put it on to the other fellow.  I should like to have the president given the power to veto a single item in a bill.  Such a law, applicable to federal appropriations, as <choice><sic>exsists</sic><corr>exists</corr></choice> in many states of the union, applicable to state appropriations, would be a good thing.  The river and harbor bill, as it will come out of conference, is one of the biggest steals in the whole country, passed, not for the purpose of bettering the condition of rivers, harbors and streams, but as providing reasons for the return of senators and representatives to Washington."</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen is the recipient from one of his admirers in Virginia of a quaint cane, carved from a limb of one of the old trees which overshadow the tomb of Thomas Jefferson, near Monticello, Va.

                            <head type="main">CHAT ABOUT THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Transmississippi Enterprise the Common Topic of Conversation.</head>
                            <head type="sub">All Who Are Posted on the Subject Are Sanguine of Its Splendid Success.</head>
                            <head type="sub">What Twenty-Four States and Territories Can Do&#8212;Individual Opinions Expressed by Men From Western States.</head>
                            <p>The Transmississippi exposition, its purpose and prospect, is becoming more and more the topic of conversation at the hotels, second only, perhaps, to the question of what will be the presidential choice of the St. Louis convention.  All who are posted on the subject speak enthusiastically and hopefully of its success.  A realization of the scope of an exposition, which will be participated in by twenty-four states, has set people to thinking.</p>
                            <p>"I see that commercial and municipal bodies of many Transmississippi states have passed resolutions indorsing the exposition," said a gentleman from the Pacific coast the other day.  "This indicates the interest which the enterprise is excited among leading citizens of the west, the men who make towns and locate cities.  It also indicates that the Omaha men who are working in its interests are doing some very effective advertising.  I believe that Omaha will do its share in making the exposition a success.  I believe that Omaha will do its share in making the exposition a success.  I have visited this city off and on for the past twenty years, and I want to say that the business men and capitalists of Omaha are real live hustlers.  If anyone can engineer this enterprise successfully, they can.</p>
                            <p>"What a magnificent thing the big show will be if the plans of its projectors are realized.  Just remember what a part the west had in the World's fair.  The magnificent exhibits of the states and the buildings erected by them respectively were something to be proud of.  The Transmississippi exposition will be second only to the World's fair in magnitude.  The California midwinter fair, the Atlanta show, will be pigmies in comparison.  That is, of course, provided that the states west of the great river realize their opportunity at the time to introduce eastern capital into the west.  If times are good, as the prospect seems now, it will be the most favorable and opportune event that has ever presented itself to the western states.  Capital will be loosening up and seeking investment to a degree hardly recognized at this time.  I only hope congress will be always ready to do the right thing.  If each state would only exercise its pull to show that honorable body what this exposition really, contemplates, it would swing around mighty quick.  Twenty-four states!  Why that's half the union!"</p>
                            <p>"Omaha has seen some pretty dull times, just as other cities throughout the country have experienced in the past few years," said General William C. Carlin, formerly commander of the department of the Columbia, the other night at the Paxton.  "Still, I see business is already recovering here, and I am certain that the bottom has been reached.  Now is a good time for investment, as will be realized two years from now, when a great stimulus will be given Omaha by the Transmississippi exposition."</p>
                            <p>General Carlin has real estate interests in the city, and although residing in Illinois, is familiar with Omaha and the west.</p>
                            <p>"Of course the exposition, like the San Francisco midwinter fair, and the World's fair, will leave a lot of driftwood in Omaha, which is not very desirable material for making good citizens.  But real estate will appreciate suddenly, and with the immense crowds of people, business will magnify and the final result will be to the upbuilding of the city.  If conditions are favorable at that time, the exposition will certainly prove a big success, and will be a great thing for the transmississippi commonwealth."</p>
                            <p>The general's property interests are largely in the west, as in his fifty years experience with the army, he lived in Washington.  And during the financial depression at Spokane in '89, he invested considerably in that country, which has since come to the front.</p>

                            <head type="sub">A WESTERN EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>An international exposition of an interesting character is projected for the year 1898.  It is to be known as the "Transmississippi and International Exposition," and will be held at Omaha from June to November, 1898.  The origin of the enterprise was in a resolution unanimously adopted by a rising vote of the Transmississippi Commercial Congress at its eighth annual session in Omaha in November last.  On that occasion it was resolved to ask Congress to take the necessary steps and to ask the representatives of various States and Territories to favor an appropriation.  A bill has since been introduced in Congress, and it is assured that the Congress will receive at least $200,000 from the government, while it is hoped that the amount will be increased to $250,000.</p>
                            <p>The object of the coming exposition is to display on a grand scale all the products, resources, industries and evidences of civilization of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi River, twenty-four in number, and embracing two-thirds of the area of the United States.  The total wealth of these States and Territories had increased in 1890 123 per cent, over the figures in the census of 1880, the total wealth being given in 1890 at more than $20,000,000,000.  It is considered by the projectors of this enterprise that, as the East had a big exposition at Philadelphia in 1876, the Central States at Chicago in 1893, while the South has recently had expositions at Atlanta and New Orleans, the time has arrived for the great and rapidly-growing West to make a display of its latent and developed wealth on a scale commensurate with the importance of the grand territory west of the Mississippi.</p>
                            <p>A permanent organization has been formed in Omaha, composed of leading and representative men of all classes in the States and Territories west of the Mississippi, who assemble at stated periods to discuss the subject.  The amount of capital stock necessary to begin business has been more than subscribed.  The management will not be local, as each State and Territory in the Transmississippi region will have a share in it through the appointment of a vice-president by the governor.  For California George W. Parsons of this city, a public-spirited citizen, who will work hard for the enterprise, has been nominated vice-president by Gov. Budd, at the suggestion of the Chamber of Commerce, and has been elected to that position by the board of directors of the exposition.  I. W. Carpenter of Omaha, a member of the board of directors, is at present in Los Angeles on a trip combining business and pleasure, and expresses himself as much encouraged at the evidence of interest in the forthcoming exposition that he has found in this section of the country.</p>
                            <p>The selection of Omaha as the site for the exposition is based chiefly upon the convenience of railroad access to that city and the large population which is immediately tributary to it.  An exposition in Omaha will draw hundreds of thousands of eastern visitors who would not make the journey to a more western point, such as Denver or Salt Lake.</p>
                            <p>The idea of this exposition is an excellent one, and The Times heartily indorses it.  There is still far too much ignorance prevalent among the people of the Atlantic seaboard in regard to the great empire west of the Mississippi, which has practically come into existence as a wealthy and civilized region since the close of the war.  On account of this marvelously-rapid growth it is not surprising that many of the old-timers in the East, who have not visited this section, cannot get it out of their heads that we are still "wild and woolly."  Such an exposition as is proposed would be an eye-opener to thousands of eastern people.  It would also be a good idea, if possible, to get the entire United States Congress to visit the show.  It would enlarge their minds and tend to make them more liberal in dealing with a section of country of which <choice><sic>may</sic><corr>many</corr></choice> among them appear to know little or nothing.</p>
                            <p>Southern California, as the Ultima Thule of western civilizations; as the transmississippi section that has been most highly favored by nature; as a section whose products are unique, whose climate is unsurpassed, and whose inhabitants are "chock full" of energy and enterprise, should come to the front at such an exposition in grand style, and even surpass the good showing made at Chicago, at San Francisco and at Atlanta.</p>

They will remain until tomorrow, when Mrs. Bennett and her little girl will take the morning train for her old home in California and Mr. Bennett will take the noon train for Omaha.  Mr. Bennett is a prominent business man of the Gate City and is deeply interested in the great exposition to be given there in 1898, of which he talks in a manner at once entertaining and enthusiastic.  He is the president of the Omaha Speed association, and is otherwise interested in that progressive western city.</p>

"Surely because it is to be held in a rival city the Missouri town is not going to sulk to her own detriment.  I have heard considerable talk in favor of the show down there among individuals, but nothing has appeared in the papers nor has any interest been shown in a public way, which I have noticed.  It seems to me that hearty co-operation among the large cities of the different states will of itself insure success.  And now is the time for them to work together and agitate the subject."</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mercer was interviewed today in regard to his exposition bill.  He said Speaker Reed had indicated to him that the bill might be brought up in the house on Monday.  There is, however, hardly a possibility of such being done, because Monday is district day in the house, and all members of the district committee are friends of the bill and it would not be wise to antagonize them.  Mr. Mercer, however, has every reason to believe that it will be brought up on Tuesday if not on Monday.  He says that there is plenty of time, for there is no danger of the house adjourning until about June 15.  He further said that now there are only about half a dozen members opposed to the bill and their opposition will not be active.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater was seen at the Shoreham this afternoon and he stated that Mr. Manley had promised him to do all he could to secure the passage of the bill.  He further stated that Senator Gear had called upon him at the Shoreham and they had tried to see Speaker Reed, but that they were unable to find him about.  Ex-Senator Kellogg has also called upon him and assured him that anything possible he could do to further the interest of the bill he would be glad to do.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Agrees to Allow the Exposition Bill to Come Before the House.</head>
                            <head type="sub">ITS PASSAGE IS EXPECTED THIS WEEK</head>
                            <head type="sub">Senator Gear and Mr. Rosewater Lay the Matter Before the Man from Maine and Induce Him to Relent.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Transmississippi exposition bill will be allowed to come before the house on its merits, Speaker Reed having stated today that he would probably have to yield to pressure.  For an hour this morning Senator Gear and Mr. Rosewater argued with the Maine statesman over the features of the bill, and brought to bear all their persuasion in behalf of the measure, which is already exciting attention throughout the western half of the continent.  Senator Gear did <choice><sic>yoeman</sic><corr>yeoman</corr></choice> service in behalf of the bill and stated that Iowa was quite as much interested as Nebraska in this great enterprise.  Mr. Reed presented his well known views on economy, but finally he agreed to give the bill a chance for its life.  Mr. Rosewater was anxious to have the measure put upon passage tomorrow, but there were many important matters of legislation pressing upon the speaker, which have priority, and in all probability it will be late in the week before the exposition bill is given recognition.  Mr. Rosewater also had a long interview with Senator Caffery, whom he succeeded in interesting, as to Louisiana representation at the exposition.  Senator Caffery went so far as to state he would use his best efforts to secure Governor Foster's co-operation in securing an appropriation at the present session of the legislature, which convened today.</p>
                            <p>The success which the promoters of the enterprise have met has instilled new hope into the Nebraska delegation, and it is now believed the bill will be passed this week.</p>

                            <head type="sub">OTHER MATTERS ADJUSTED.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater, with Congressman Mercer, had a satisfactory interview with First Assistant Postmaster General Jones over Omaha postoffice matters.  June 1 carrier service in Omaha will be adjusted to conform with the new orders, three carriers being dropped.  These carriers, instead of losing their positions, will be put on the substitute list, pending an increase in the service, when they will be re-employed.  General Jones stated he had no desire to reflect upon Omaha; that 100 carriers had been dropped in Philadelphia, and that a reorganization of the service was going on all over the country.  While he was inclined to do all for Omaha possible, he felt that at least three carriers could with safety be dropped, and the Omaha men were content to let well enough alone, in view of the fact that ten men were recommended in the report for dismissal.</p>
                            <p>A representative of the court of claims was in Omaha recently and gave General Jones a fair impression of the situation.  With this before the first assistant postmaster general, neither Mr. Mercer nor Mr. Rosewater was anxious to criticise the action of the special examiner, although the dropping of ten men from carrier service would have greatly retarded business in the Omaha office, which has an excellent reputation for efficiency and earning capacity.</p>
                            <p>The Fort Omaha military reservation bill, another measure which brought a delegation of Nebraska citizens to look after, is safe.  Interviews were had today with Senators Hawley, Walthall, Shoup, Sewell and Bate by Mr. Rosewater, and the result was entirely satisfactory.  Conditions not understood at his long distance were satisfactorily explained to the members of the committee on military affairs, and the bill will be reported Thursday from the committee.  Much misinformation had to be overcome in this latter care, but when General Hawley understood the situation and saw the comprehensive scope designed by the bill, he unhesitatingly gave it his support.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Strode of Nebraska received petitions today signed by 800 residents of his state praying for the passage of the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill.</p>

                            <head type="sub">To Advertise Her <choice><sic>Recourses</sic><corr>Resources</corr></choice> at the Omaha Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Editor of the Daily Herald:&#8212;Dear Sir:&#8212;The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition of all the products, resources, industries and civilization of the states and territories west of the Mississippi River, embracing two-thirds of the area of the United States, to be held at Omaha, beginning in June and ending in December in the year 1898, is owing to a resolution adopted by a rising vote of the Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress at its eighth annual session held at Omaha in November, 1895.</p>
                            <p>This region embraces nineteen states and territories, this territory has been, increasing very <choice><sic>hapidly</sic><corr>rapidly</corr></choice> in population and reliable estimates indicate that certain sections are capable of supporting 70,000,000 people without crowding, still leaving a vast domain where the homeless can find millions of prosperous pursuits and homes.</p>
                            <p>This problem presented itself to the Congress at its session in Omaha, and during the discussions ,official and unofficial, among the members ,the question arose ,as to the best method of impressing these facts upon the people of the United States and other nations, and the best <choice><sic>manne rin</sic><corr>manner in</corr></choice> which the tremendous resources, wealth and possibilities of the Trans-Mississippi region could be made known to the people of the world.  The enormous wealth and increase of the country west of and including the Mississippi Valley states, were conceded in a general way, the rapid growth of its principal cities, like New Orleans, Galveston, Houston, St. Louis, Little Rock, Kansas City, Topeka, Leavenworth, Atchison, Des Moines Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Burlington, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Lincoln, Omaha, Denver, Pueblo, Salt Lake, Ogden, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, Tacoma, Deadwood, Helena, Butte, Anaconda, Great Falls and Billings, with Chicago, Milwaukee and numerous other manufacturing centers on the East depended on them, were universally admitted, but the powerful forces at work creating these communities and adding to their prosperity, as well as the states wherein they are located, were not appreciably considered.  To supply this needed information, as well as to attract the further attention of all persons seeking homes, and avenues to improve their fortunes, as well as investing capitalists ,was the desire of this congress.</p>
                            <p>The East held the exposition at Philadelphia ,in 1876, the central states at Chicago in 1893, the southern states at Atlanta in 1895, where they displayed their resources and wealth, it was deemed proper that the great West should also hold an exposition in 1898, which should be second only in magnificence to the Columbian Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The business men of Omaha have taken hold of the matter and organized an exposition company with a capital of $1,000,000, of which $500,000 is to be <choice><sic>pain</sic><corr>paid</corr></choice> in at once.  They have also engaged the leading architects of the country to prepare plans for grounds and buildings, which will compare favorably to the Columbian Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The United States government has appropriated $50,000 for a building and $150,000 for a state display, Nebraska will put up a building that will cost fully $200,000.  The following states have already made appropriations for putting up buildings, viz: Louisiana, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas and Colorado.  In the remaining states and territories, the legislatures do not convene until this winter, when a sufficient amount will be appropriated by a majority of them to make a creditable showing of their respective wealth and resources.</p>
                            <p>The Republic of Mexico has recognized the exposition as International and has notified the exposition company that it would make a fine display.  Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Chili and Central American states have written, asking for information concerning the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The management will not be local.  Each state and territory in the Trans-Mississippi region will have a share in it, through the apartment of a vice president by the Governor thereof, so that the full force and authority of the government of each one of the states will be fully enlisted in the great enterprise.</p>
                            <p>The following well-known business men of Omaha have been elected as officers of the exposition company:</p>
                            <p>President&#8212;G. W. Wattles, vice president of the Union National bank.</p>
                            <p>Vice President&#8212;J. E. Markel, President of Pacific Hotel Company.</p>
                            <p>Treasurer&#8212;Herman Kountze, President of First National bank.</p>
                            <p>Secretary&#8212;John A. Wakefield, wholesale lumber merchant.</p>
                            <p>Montana should awaken to the importance of this vast undertaking and the benefits arising from making a creditable showing at the first grand exposition ever held in the West.  It is of the greatest importance that Montana should make an effort to outdo the display made at Chicago, as no such opportunity has ever before been offered to this state to advertise its products and resources to the people of this country, who have become dissatisfied with their homes in the East, and are <choice><sic>seekin gnew</sic><corr>seeking new</corr></choice> homes in the Great West, as this exposition will afford.  Governor Rickards should appoint the vice president for this state at once, and should also seek some one who has a personal knowledge of knowing how to collect the material and afterwards to make a creditable showing therewith.  This state should also appropriate a sufficient sum to put up a state building at Omaha ,that will be a credit to Montana "THE TREASURE STATE" of the Union.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mercer said today in regard to his exposition bill that it is with other important matters which are now before the committee on rules.  He does not think the house will adjourn before June 15 at the earliest, so there is no cause for the friends of the bill to be uneasy on that score.</p>
                            <p>"The people," he said, "should rest on their oars, for the bill has been pushed to such a point that it is sure to pass."</p>
                            <p>Speaker Reed did not keep his promise of recognition yesterday, for such business came up that it was impossible for him to do so.  When the bill passes the credit should mostly fall to Mr. Mercer, for ever since its introduction he has labored hard for its passage.  Mr. Mercer has great influence in the house, and many prominent members, friends of his, have promised to take an active part in favor of the bill.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Allen, the wife of Senator Allen, will leave this city tomorrow and go to Chicago, where she will spend a few days with relatives.

                            <p>In the land case of John Graff, sr., against Christian Paschold and others, from the Lincoln, Neb., land district, Secretary Smith today overruled the decision of the commissioner, awarding a preference right of entry to Paschold, and holds all entries for cancellation, pending the issuance of a patient to the Burlington &amp; Missouri River Railroad company.</p>
                            <p>The secretary also rendered a decision adverse to the state of South Dakota on its claim for the payment of 5 per cent of the money derived from the sale of Indian lands, and also the estimated price at $1.25 per acre of all land in the state which has been retained or allotted to the Indians.

                            <head type="sub">Conditions in the House Indicate that the Allen Bill Will Go Through&#8212;Fort Omaha Matter Coming Up.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 12.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Mr. Rosewater left for home this afternoon, satisfied that the matters which called him to Washington were in safe hands, with very excellent prospects of getting through both houses of congress this session.  Senator Allison has volunteered his interest in behalf of the Omaha exposition bill, and will see Speaker Reed tomorrow to induce him to give his recognition to the measure.  Senator Allison's help in this respect is vital.  It shows his strong interest in the exposition.  There is no question of political preference with him.  It is the building up of the west that he aims for, and he volunteers help because of his strong interest in the section of country seeking recognition.  No day has been set by Speaker Reed for a hearing upon the exposition bill.  There is every indication that the bill will pass at this session.  It may not be this week, but those who are nearest Speaker Reed believe that he intends to give the Omaha exposition bill a day and the Nebraska delegation is watching for some indication to relieve them.</p>
                            <p>Senator Warren of the committee on military affairs will on Thursday move to take up the Fort Omaha military bill, which had tacitly been shelved for the present session.  Senator Walthall, who has a bill in charge, will not oppose such a motion.  Before leaving for home to meet William Jennings Bryan in a debate upon the finance question, Mr. Rosewater saw almost every member of the committee, and with one or two exceptions they are in favor of allowing the state of Nebraska to say whether it will accept Fort Omaha for school purposes and whether it will maintain an institution in the west similar to those maintained in the east and south.  These measures are very vital.  The military reservation bill meets the hearty support of General Brooke, who directed the parade today, and even General Batchelder has nothing to say against the measure.  In view of this condition, it seems safe to predict that both bills above referred to will be favorably acted upon.</p>
                            <p>The contract for the interior finish of the public building at Sioux City, Ia., was today awarded to the Butler-Ryan company of St. Paul, on its bid of $54,050.</p>
                            <p>A new candidate for vice president is announced in the person of Cornelius N. Bliss of New York, who is one of the successful business men of that section.  He is treasurer of the republican national committee.</p>

                            <p>The letter of Mr. John A. Wakefield, secretary of the trans-Mississippi congress, to Mr. Tom Richardson, secretary of the deep water utilization committee, herewith, fully explains itself and is worthy of careful perusal as a document of much value.  It will appear also in The Tribune's export and import edition:</p>
                            <p>Omaha, Neb., March 5. &#8212; Mr. Tom Richardson, Secretary Deep Water Utilization Committee&#8212;My Dear Sir: Referring to your recent favor relative to the advantages to be derived from holding the exposition of the trans-Mississippi states and territories at Omaha in 1898, with reference to encouraging business with the south, Mexico, Central America and the West Indies, and also the exporting and importing of western products through the gulf ports, to tough upon the origin of the exposition of the products, resources and development of the 24 states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river, from Manitoba and British Columbia on the north to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico on the south, and from the great river on the east to the Pacific ocean on the west, and the trans-Mississippi congress, which has unanimously indorsed it, selecting Omaha as the most central and convenient point where the people living in this vast region can easily congregate.</p>
                            <p>The trans-Mississippi congress is composed of leading men of all classes, pursuits and professions, living west of the Mississippi river, who come together at stated periods to discuss methods and measures to promote the development and prosperity of these western states and territories, recommending such of them as its best judgment dictates to the national congress, the states and the people for adoption.  It knows neither creed, class nor politics, nor any special system of finance, but men of all opinions freely commingle and fraternize, with the sole purpose of serving their constituency to the best advantage.  In this they act in unison, although the largest liberty of discussion is permitted.</p>
                            <p>The eighth annual session of this congress was held in this city in November last.  It had a most notable and successful session.  It was composed of high tariff men, free trade men, gold men, silver men and men of all shades of opinion.  It was in every sense a representative body of the people of the western half of the United States, from the gulf to the British possessions.  In the discussions the fact became apparent that the states lying east of the Mississippi had been favored with great expositions of their resources and development, beginning with the centennial in 1876 at Philadelphia and continuing through the New Orleans exposition, the world's fair at Chicago and the cotton states'' exposition at Atlanta, while the Pacific coast was favored by the mid-winter fair at San Francisco.</p>
                            <p>While no exposition of the growth and prosperity of the trans-Mississippi states and territories, as the east, south, west and Pacific coast had such exhibits, the suggestion was made to have one for the states and territories west of the Mississippi at some central point, which should be second only to the Columbian exposition at Chicago in 1893.  This met with instant favor and the following <unclear reason="torn"/>voring the exposition, a memorial was offered by a delegate from California asking the present national congress for such legislation as to insure a prompt completion of the Nicaragua canal, under the control of the United States government, to insure to American commerce and other nations low tolls and freedom from discrimination of any kind.  At the same session Hon. Howel Jones, president of the deep water utilization committee, speaking of the advantages of deep water harbors on the gulf of Mexico to western agriculture, showed that on this latitude and longitude [Omaha] the distance to Galveston was 585 miles less than the distance to New York.  This being the central point the difference will vary more or less according to locality.  He said the great body of our exports are derived from the farm (about 74 per cent or $627,216,656 in 1890) and that all of the coffee and seven-eighths of the sugar is imported (or $194,721,363 and $78,547,021 of wines in 1890) and most of the coffee consumed in the territory commercially tributary to Galveston is imported from southern countries and the sugar is imported from Cuba.  Therefore by virtue of the shorter route via Galveston, as soon as this new trade is established the people of the northwest can import all the coffee and sugar we consume and save money now paid to the longer route (of say 585 miles) via New York.</p>
                            <p>As to the exports, I am using the figures of the last census because they are official.  The value of the cotton and cotton seed oil exported in 1890 amounted to $256,259,970, and the exports of bread-stuffs $154,925,927.  Of the latter the exports of corn amounted in round numbers to $43,555,000, wheat $45,275,000 and flour of all kinds $57,980,000.  In the same year the value of flour manufactured in the five northwestern states was: Minnesota, $60,158,088; Missouri, $34,486,795; Nebraska, $6,365,492; Kansas, $17,420,475; Iowa, $11,833,737, or a total of $130,264,587.  I mention the item of flour because you will see that much of it is drawn from Minnesota and Missouri, the two largest western flour manufacturing states, for export to South American ports via New York, which can be handled to greater advantage at Galveston with a through trunk railroad line and the completion of the Nicaragua canal, making Galveston or New Orleans the nearest sea port to the Pacific South American states, as well as Europe, Brazil, Mexico and other points on the east.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the importance of the Nicaragua canal, the Hon. Warner Miller, in a recent address to the manufacturers in New York, said we furnished $14,000,000 exports to Mexico, or 45 per cent, and took 75 per cent of her imports in 1893.  The Central American states imported $21,000,000 of products, of which we furnished 24 1-2 per cent; they exported $30,000,000, of which we took 32 1-2 per cent.  The South American states imported $400,000,000, of which we furnished 8 1-4 per cent; they exported $456,000,000, of which we took 45.6; Cuba exported $87,000,000, of which we took 81 per cent, and imported $55,000,000, of which we furnished nearly 34 per cent.  He said "there is but one proper way of securing the United States its proper proportion of the vast trade of the Pacific and that is by the construction of the Nicaraguan canal."</p>
                            <p>Owing to its deep water facilities and the possession of a trunk railroad line (the Illinois Central) from Chicago.  New Orleans is experiencing an expansion of trade and exports such as that city has never known before.  Its exports of corn to Europe in January of the present year show an increase of 2,519,705 bushels, and the Illinois Central is making arrangements for it to attain to much larger proportions.</p>
                            <p>Before closing this communication, I desire to call your attention to the vast wealth and resources of the trans-Mississippi states, exclusive of the territories, as compiled in the last census.  Comprising two-thirds of the area of the United States, they contained a population of $16,545,506, an increase of nearly 46 per cent in 10 years.  They had 271,730,999 acres in farm lands, an increase of 49 per cent over 1880.  Of these farm lands, 158,166,581 acres were improved, an increase of 65 per cent in 10 years.  The value of farm lands, fences and buildings was $4,651,767,082, an increase of 112 per cent over 1880.  The value of live stock on farms was $1,000,297,247, an increase of 81 per cent in 10 years.  These trans-Mississippi states had 8,335,484 head of horses and <unclear reason="torn"/>, an increase of <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>To almost all those of the eastern and northern states, besides many of those of tropical countries.</p>
                            <p>Is irrigation required to produce crops?</p>
                            <p>No; but at times it does good.</p>
                            <p>What are the leading market fruits?</p>
                            <p>Pears, figs, grapes, plums, peaches and strawberries.</p>
                            <p>Is the acreage adapted to pear and fruit culture being enlarged?</p>
                            <p>It is, rapidly; thousands of trees have been put out this last winter.</p>
                            <p>How many years after planting before trees begin bearing?</p>
                            <p>Pears, four to five years; plums and peaches, two years, figs and grapes, two years.</p>
                            <p>What is the value of the product per acre after trees begin to bear?</p>
                            <p>From $200 to $500.</p>
                            <p>What can be made per acre in small fruits and vegetables while an orchard is coming into bearing?</p>
                            <p>From $100 to $300 and in some cases more has been made.</p>
                            <p>What kinds of vegetables are grown?</p>
                            <p>Nearly all those grown in every section of the United States.</p>
                            <p>How long is the growing season for vegetables?</p>
                            <p>The entire year for the more hardy varieties.</p>
                            <p>What profits are there in poultry?</p>
                            <p>Fowls sell from $3 to $4 per dozen; eggs average 15 to 20 cents.</p>
                            <p>What inducements are offered to dairymen?</p>
                            <p>The very best; dairy products find a ready market at high prices.</p>
                            <p>What are the rates of living?</p>
                            <p>About the same as in the north, with fuel and clothing cheaper.</p>
                            <p>What is the cost of fuel?</p>
                            <p>Hard wood, $3 to $4 per cord; but much less wood is needed here.</p>
                            <p>What are the inducements for immigration to southern Texas?</p>
                            <p>The moderate price of land, considering its fertility and location, the certainty of large returns under proper care and cultivation and good public schools.</p>
                            <p>Why is it better for a poor man?</p>
                            <p>On account of the moderate climate one can work nearly every day in the year.</p>
                            <p>What is the price of building material?</p>
                            <p>For ordinary house building, lumber runs from $10 to $14 per 1000.</p>
                            <p>What can a plain house of four to five rooms be built for?</p>
                            <p>From $200 to $500.</p>
                            <p>How many acres of land in the coast country will support an average family?</p>
                            <p>Ten to 20 acres.</p>
                            <p>What are taxes?</p>
                            <p>$1.75 on each $100, state, county and city tax.</p>
                            <p>What kind of people reside in the coast country?</p>
                            <p>The very best people from the east, north, west and south, representing true American enterprise, stability and religious refinement.</p>
                            <p>These questions are fairly asked and answered as is possible to be done.  They are based on actual experience in this country on these lines.</p>
                            <p>The board of trade was organized as <unclear reason="torn"/> annum.</p>
                            <p>In no<unclear reason="blurred"/>ons, which are close kin to dry-goods, the volume of monthly trade will reach $30,000 in the course of thirty days, or almost three quarters of a million in twelve months.</p>
                            <p>Boots and shoes form another staple in which Galveston deals largely.  One house here deals exclusively in footwear, and its business will touch the hundred <choice><sic>thousan</sic><corr>thousand</corr></choice> dollar mark every month, and is constantly growing.  To reach the result of its year's transactions it is a simple matter of multiplication.</p>
                            <p>In hats an average amount of $15,000 per month would safely indicate that town's transactions in a wholesale way.</p>
                            <p>If there is any error in these figures it has been made on the conservative side.</p>
                            <p>In this connection, only eight of the leading lines of trade have been taken into consideration.  The business in coffee, sugar, flour and like staples which are handled in large quantities are omitted because the figures to which The Tribune gained access could not be made to accurately reflect the precise conditions of trade.</p>
                            <p>The retailers have also been omitted, on account of the almost utter impossibility of securing correct informations.</p>
                            <p>The ramifications of the retail dealers are so extended as to defy accuracy.  The hundreds of small dealers play their part in summing up the grand total as much so as the great merchant, with his scores of clerks, whose business runs into the thousands daily.</p>
                            <p>A tour of the retail district will indicate to the most skeptical that Galveston's home trade is not to be despised.  The great bazaars are thronged daily with eager buyers.  The silks of the rich man's wife rustle against the cheaper fabric of their less favored neighbor, and the whole go to create the great volume of Galveston's retail trade.</p>
                            <p>The conditions obtaining here are more favorable to the small dealer than those to be found in the great centers of trade.  Adjoining the establishment of the great merchant may be found the place of business of one of more modest means.  The two dwell together in harmony and prosperity.  The tendency found in large cities wherein trade passes by the small dealer to pay tribute to the great house, is, as before indicated, conspicuously absent in Galveston.  This is a feature of the business of this town which at once impresses itself upon the visiting merchant whether he comes here for recreation or for purposes of investigation.  It is a condition, also, which has contributed largely to Galveston's quick and general prosperity.  The proprietor of limited means finds here an opportunity to embark in business with a chance of success denied him in many of the larger and busier centers of trade.</p>
                            <p>The territory covered by Galveston's wholesale merchants includes the State of Texas and extends into Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.  Year by year extensions are made to the territory covered, the growth being uniform and healthy.</p>
                            <p>As to the methods pursued by the Galveston merchants, their facilities have improved with the increase in their trade.  While a tour of the Strand, where the great houses are largely located, would not perhaps impress one with the magnitude of their business transactions, a visit to the great warehouses, near the depots of the railways, would leave a different impression.  Foreign trade is beginning to attract its share of attention.  What it will amount to is as yet problematical.</p>
                            <p>On the whole, a careful investigation of Galveston's business interests results in showing a most satisfactory and healthy condition.</p>

                            <p>The exposition bill will probably be reached in a few days, as the house is now disposing of all legislation as rapidly as possible.  All interested, and especially Mr. Mercer, are still working in its interests.  Mr. Mercer now thinks the bill will be passed without a dissenting vote.  Mr. Mondell of Wyoming introduced a bill in the house today increasing the pension of J. F. Crawford to $50 per month.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Pickler's bill granting an honorable discharge to Daniel Martin was favorably reported today from the committee on military affairs.  The bill was amended by dating the discharge July 28, 1848, the time at which he and his company were mustered out.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Promises Mr. Rosewater to Use His Influence with the Man from Maine in Behalf of the Bill.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 10.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Since the presence of Mr. Rosewater in the city the exposition matters have been advanced materially, although he has yet to secure consent of Speaker Reed to allow the bill to be called up.  He has, however, succeeded in gaining the friendship of Hon. J. H. Manley for the measure, which is decidedly advantageous, in view of the known relation Mr. Manley holds to the Maine statesman.  In an interview Mr. Manley tonight told Mr. Rosewater that he would do all in his power to secure the speaker's consent to place the bill on passage.  This is the best piece of news thus far since the bill passed in the senate and was reported favorably in the house.</p>
                            <p>Another strong factor for the good of the exposition is the outspoken sympathy of ex-Governor William Pitt Kellogg of Louisiana, who has large property holdings in Omaha.  Mr. Kellogg has suggested a number of things which might be done to induce Speaker Reed to favor the measure, and they will be acted upon.  It is essential that the bill pass this week, as the Louisiana legislature meets next week, and an effort will be made to have the governor of that state send a communication to the legislature calling its attention to Nebraska's participation in the New Orleans exposition and asking for similar representation at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The presence of Mr. Rosewater has stirred the Nebraska delegation to renewed action and there is now hope that the bill will pass this week.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston, Congressman Mercer and Mr. Rosewater will call upon First Assistant Postmaster General Jones in the morning and attempt to adjust the difficulties as to the Omaha carriers in a way that will be satisfactory to the carriers and to the citizens.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LEGISLATURE CAN BE DEPENDED ON</head>
                            <head type="sub">Hon. John Doniphan Meets with the Local Directory and Discusses the Outlook for the Big Show in 1898.</head>
                            <p>Hon. John Doniphan of St. Joseph, vice president of the Transmississippi exposition from Missouri, was present at yesterday afternoon's meeting of the Transmississippi exposition directory.  Among other things, he said:  "Politics has been absorbing so much of our attention down in Missouri recently that the Transmississippi exposition has hardly been fairly presented to our people.  I think there is no doubt but that when the matter gets squarely before the people of our state it will meet with their hearty disapproval.  Our legislature convenes the first Wednesday in January next, and the friends of the exposition will see that men favorable to the enterprise are chosen as state legislators.  If I weren't so old I'd run for the legislature myself.  This session of the legislature will elect a United States senator.  Should the democrats be in the majority, it is probable that either Gibson or Stevens will be elected.  The former is an enthusiastic supporter of the exposition and I think the latter is not opposed to aiding it.  Should the republicans have control of the legislature, Mr. Warner of Kansas City will undoubtedly be elected United States senator and I believe he is favorable to the exposition."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Doniphan was asked by President Wattles what he thought of the scheme of four or five states combining their exhibits and making a grand display in a building erected by the joint appropriations of those states.  Missouri's vice president in reply said:  "I've never heard the matter suggested before, but it is exactly in line with what was forcibly brought to my attention at the Columbian exposition.  Our state appropriated $150,000 for a building there and I presume some one retired on the earnings.  At any rate the exhibit of Missouri amounted to little save on paper and the people of our state who had placed their expectations high were grievously disappointed.  I believe the states would be represented to greater advantage, that there would be a better class of buildings and that the visitors from the states concerned would be better pleased if such a move were made."</p>
                            <p>It was explained by President Wattles in support of his scheme that each state going into such a combination would receive space proportionate with its appropriation and that at the close of the exposition it would also receive its proportionate share of the proceeds derived from the sale of the building.</p>
                            <p>In reply to a question for information on the part of Vice President Doniphan, Secretary Wakefield said that nine of the transmississippi states had thus far appointed vice presidents.  He also states that the legislature of only two of the states interested had been in session during the past winter.  He said that as soon as congress acted favorably on the bill now before it systematic work would be begun in the other states with a view to securing their endorsement and their appropriations.  He stated that he had just written to the governor of <unclear reason="torn"/> recommending an appropriation be <unclear reason="torn"/>state, which is now <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>I. W. Carpenter, one of the directors, was present after an absence of two months in California.  He said that he had found sentiment throughout the state very favorable to the exposition.  He believed that he was justified in concluding from what he had seen and heard while there that California would be well represented.</p>
                            <p>The meeting adjourned until 12:30 o'clock this afternoon, at which time the report of Edward Rosewater on his recent trip to Washington in behalf of the exposition will be received.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mercer does not think that much more time will elapse before the house passes upon his bill.  Senator Allen said today in a jocular manner: "If these fellows in the house would hustle like we did in the senate the bill would have been passed long ago."</p>
                            <p>That is not the case, however, for Mr. Mercer has hustled and continues in the interests of the bill.  Again, it is a rare occurrence for any legislation in the house to be passed by that body without its being delayed.  A large amount of business has been done away with this week.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Reed is the only obstacle in the way of its immediate passage.  The bill would have been passed long ago except for him.  Since he has promised recognition, everybody interested in the bill has been present at the meetings of the house daily in the hope of it being brought up.</p>
                            <p>Something will be done soon, but Mr. Mercer does not like the continual hope of recognition thrown out to him and then drawn back.  He would like a definite date set for consideration of the bill..  Many of the most prominent members, friends of Mr. Mercer, have tried to get Mr. Reed to set a day, but as is well known their efforts were unavailing.  All the members, possibly excepting half a dozen, will vote for the passage of the bill.</p>

                            <p>Commissioner Lamoreaux will shortly prepare instructions for the guidance of the settlers on the Burlington railroad lands in Nebraska, in preparing the evidence of the bona fides, required by the act of March, 1896.  These instructions will be prepared with a view to saving the settlers as much expense as is possible in securing patents for their holdings.</p>
                            <p>Lieutenant Charles G. Lyman, Second cavalry, having been found by an examining board unfitted for promotion on account of physical disabilities contracted in the line of duty, will proceed to his home and report by letter to the adjutant general of the army.</p>

                            <p>Great enterprises cannot be pushed to success in a moment, and the friends of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, especially the directors, should not be discouraged if the bill for a government appropriation moves slowly.  No exposition in years, except that at Chicago in 1893, had so good a claim upon the government as this one, which purposes to show the progress and wealth of the great west.  Congress will recognize this fact eventually and the appropriation will come.  Citizens of Omaha, capitalists in particular, should profit by the annoyance occasioned by congressional delay and at once awake to the importance of the enterprise which they will be called upon to care for.  Government recognition and appropriation will insure the holding of the exposition, but its success depends on ourselves.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NOT ON THE PROGRAM.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exposition Bill Forgotten in the Forecast for the House.</head>
                            <p>Washington, D. C., May 17.&#8212;The program of business in the house of representatives depends largely upon the developments from day to day, so that a forecast for the week, especially of the order in which measures shall be considered, cannot be given.  Tomorrow, under the rules, will be suspension day and Mr. Dalzell (rep. Pa.) will ask for the committee on ways and means the passage of the bill which is known as the "package bill."  This provides that packages of imported merchandise weighing less than 100 pounds and valued at less than $500 may be transported in bond over the Canadian railroads to destination.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Scranton (rep. Pa.) has given notice that he will ask the house immediately after the reading of the journal tomorrow to reconsider the vote by which it refused some days ago to order to a third reading the bill to provide for the election of a delegate to congress from Alaska.  An effort will be made to lay that motion on the table if Mr. Scranton presses it, but should that fail the subject will be open for discussion and may occupy a good portion of the day.  Should there be any time left after the house has disposed of the motions to pass bills by suspension of the rules, it will probably be given to the committee on immigration for the consideration of bills reported by it.  This committee will probably have Tuesday's session.  It will present the McCall bill to regulate immigration from Europe, and the Corliss and Mahany bills, intended to relieve the cities on the Canadian border of the competition of labor from Canada which does not find an abiding place in the United States.</p>
                            <p>The committee on rules is inclined to give the committee on labor a day for the Phillips commission bill and the Erdman arbitration bill, the latter embodying the proposition of the then Attorney General Olney, passed at the last session of congress and which it is understood the labor organizations approved.  The Phillips bill appropriates $500,000 to enable a commission to make an exhaustive investigation into the relations between labor and capital.</p>
                            <p>Another day will also be allotted to the committee on territories, which wants the house to consider the New Mexico bond bill (as amended in the senate) and the bill to protect the salmon fisheries in Alaska.</p>
                            <p>Should there remain any time at the disposal of the committee on rules, it will be devoted to the consideration of the contested election cases on the calender&#8212;three of which are likely to be fought out with much earnestness&#8212;Murray vs. Elliott, First South Carolina district; Yost vs. Tucker, Tenth Virginia district, and Johnson vs. Stokes, Seventh South Carolina district.</p>

                            <p>Washington, D. C. May 17.&#8212;The appropriations committee intends to keep the senate hard at work on appropriation bills during all of the week.  The District of Columbia bill is now the unfinished business and it may be that this will consume the better part of three days.  Especially is this true if the subject of appropriations for the various charities precipitates a debate at all like that in the house.</p>
                            <p>The fortifications bill will come up next.  It will be reported to the senate tomorrow.  Considerable of increase is understood to have to be made to this bill.  When this comes up Mr. Gorman will offer an amendment providing for an issue of $50,000,000 or $100,000,000 of low interest bearing certificates and will make a speech.  This certificate amendment will in all probability cause a discussion that will run over two or three days, but it will not be permitted to indefinitely postpone the final vote on the appropriation bill.</p>

                            <p>A delegation of prominent Omaha business men visited Council Bluffs last evening and made a friendly call upon Mr. and Mrs. Harold McCormick at the Grand hotel.  The visitors said that their call was purely an informal one and solely for the purpose of becoming acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. McCormick and to welcome them to their western home.  Mr. McCormick, too, having arrived here but recently, is not quite up to date in the matter of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, and the visitors from Omaha desired to secure his interest in furtherance of that project.</p>
                            <p>There was some suspicion among Council Bluffs people that the Omaha gentlemen were endeavoring to manage a removal of the McCormick interests to that city from Council Bluffs, but this was denied by members of the party who were spoken to.</p>

                            <p>Frank Grice, editor of the San Antonio Daily Express, was in Denver last week, and in the course of an interview he gave the people of that city a specimen of his enthusiasm for the nineteen states and five territories of the trans-Mississippi region, and the necessity for having a deep water harbor at Arkansas Pass in the state he hails from.  Mr. Grice said:  "More than 75 per cent of all our exports originate in the trans-Mississippi.  More than 25 per cent of our entire population live west of the great river.  More than three-fourths of the coal and iron of the whole country lies in that region.  It produces one-half the cotton crop of the world.  It contains practically all the gold, silver and copper, and most of the lead of the entire country.  Statistics show its population to be actually the most intelligent on earth, far higher on the average than even the North Atlantic states.  They are the most progressive of all Americans and they are developing their region the most rapidly.</p>
                            <p>"All history fails to show any such development as has taken place within twenty-five years in the trans-Mississippi.  I tell you, that with the enormous traffic already tributary to a Texas port, the opening of a twenty-six to thirty-foot harbor&#8212;and mind you, twenty feet is not deep water in these days&#8212;will see the development of a city on the shores of that harbor surpassing in rapidity of growth the best growth ever before witnessed even in this land of magic cities."</p>
                            <p>It is to be hoped that Mr. Grice will turn himself loose with the same eloquence for the great Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THE EAST OMAHA EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>The Omaha Bee, in opening its mouth to speak in regard to park commissioners, puts its foot in it clear up to the shank.  It urges that commissioners should be chosen who have ability and wisdom enough to not only look after Omaha parks, but also to do the landscape gardening and the financiering for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.  The Bee remarks, with a coolness which would make ice in Hades, "it is among the probabilities, if not an assured thing, that the exposition will be located in one of our public parks, or on land contiguous to one of our parks so that the grounds will be under control of the park board."</p>
                            <p>Now, we would be mad if we thought for an instant that the Bee knows what it is trying to talk about, but it seems that this paragraph must have broken away from the wit and humor column where it was first placed and got through the column rule into the editorial field.  It would be intensely funny to see an Omaha park commissioner scattering Iowa's appropriation on his own ground like blue grass seed and building an Omaha band house at the expense of Uncle Sam.  Some way the idea has got abroad that there were to be twenty-four states represented in this exposition, and now to have an Omaha paper declare that the only show is to be the show which a park commissioner makes of himself in trying to boss the whole job, spend all the money and reap all the benefits is proof sufficient that Bill Nye has a worthy successor.</p>
                            <p>We know we do wrong in referring again to the fact that East Omaha is the only practical site for the exposition, for the Bee has time and again told us to keep still about the question of location, because any discussion of the matter would jeopardize the desired acquiring of appropriations from congress and the various states.  But since the Bee itself has started it this time perhaps we may be forgiven for just remarking, quietly and inoffensively, that the directors of the exposition project have given Council Bluffs and others interested, the assurance, clear and unqualified, and accompanied by the best bond on earth, the word of honorable manhood, that when the proper time comes, the question of location will be fairly and impartially determined and only after all parties interested have had due opportunity to present the advantages offered by various sites.</p>
                            <p>No, Council Bluffs has worked and will work for the exposition, and work with its coat off, but it is not ready to believe that the directors of the exposition will break its pledge, nor that it will step aside while the Bee picks out one of Omaha's parks for a site and directs a park commissioner to put the money where it will do the most good for Omaha.</p>

                            <p>"I had never heard of your proposition to hold a Transmississippi exposition," said Mr. Strauss of New York, one of the representatives of the bondholders of the American Water Works company, "until I reached Omaha, and was engaged in conversation with one of your citizens.  I found out pretty soon that you western people have got your minds set on it and will be satisfied with nothing short of success.  But I am assured, without knowing any more about it than I do now, that it will be a good thing, and nothign would please me more than to see Omaha get it.  Do I think eastern people as a class are ignorant of the vast resources of the west?  Well," and a smile broke over the New Yorker's face, "no, I don't.  The fact is, I think mose of this talk about easterners having crude and prejudiced ideas of the west, originated entirely with the newspapers.  A good many of you people out here are easterners by birth, and men of means in the east, those whom you want to attract to this country, are just as cognizant of the great resources and untouched wealth of the western states as you are.  But expositions of the kind are always a good thing for the country.  It is not going to benefit the west alone, either.  My idea is that such an enterprise is a splendid thing for the whole country.  It shows the proper spirit and push, and will attract capital this way, which will result in as much good to the east, which makes the investment, as the westerners who make the sales.  This is a big country, and what benefits one section is bound to help the other.  There ought to be no rivalry between us, and there isn't only in the newspapers."</p>
                            <p>Winthrop Smith of Philadelphia, also one of the bondholders' committee, broke in at this point.  "I am a western man by birth myself," he added, " was born and lived for many years in Ohio.  (To Mr. Smith that was enough to make him a true son of the far west.)  And of all the cities I have been in out here, Omaha is the prettiest and most up-to-date one of them all.  Now this is not flattery, because to speak with you frankly, in my business ventures and investments here I have not been very fortunate.  But Omaha is a nice little city, and ought to, some day, be a big metropolis.  Back of Omaha, in the mountain states and the rich agricultural regions, there is all the natural wealth that could be wished for.  What you need is capital to develop, of course.  This exposition ought to do a great deal toward attracting investors this way.  But right in this line, I think western newspapers and politicians make a mistake in fighting corporations the way they do.  It doesn't do any good and confidence is scattered to the winds.  You like to legislate against them and give them the worst of it whenever you can.  Now I could mention several cities which have not profited by this sort of thing.  We are not greedy monsters ready to devour a farm at every meal with the voracity with which Bluebeard chopped off the heads of his wives.  We often get the worst of it, and suffer the consequences just as much as the farmer whose farm is foreclosed.  Many investments in the west have been lost by bad securities and false representations of western men seeking loans.  We suffer for it.  Omaha is on the eastern border of the transmississippi commonwealth and I hope you will get that <choice><sic>expostition</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice>, and that the east and west will be drawn into closer relations by it, for their mutual good."</p>
                            <p>"I hope that Omaha will get the exposition," said Elliott S. Miller of Des Moines, the other night at the Paxton.  "Sometimes it seems to me that we have almost too many of those enterprises nowadays, but after all they accomplish a good deal of good which it is difficult to estimate.  There is no doubt that the Atlanta exposition did considerable for the south, the New Orleans and the California expositions did as much for the country which produced them.  It will bring lots of people here and that alone will be a great thing for the west and a greater thing for Omaha.  This exposition is built on a magnificent scale and the western commonwealth ought to be able to put up a great show.  It is something that all the states should take a vital interest in, as it will beat any advertisement they have ever had.  I hope it will be a success."</p>
                            <p>"Whenever we want anything out at Hastings," said Attorney J. J. Buchanan, "we get together, populists, republicans, democrats and all, and make a strong united pull.  A united pull is the only thing that will secure the Transmississippi exposition and make it a success.  There ought to be no politics in it whatever.  Why, we ought to everyone of use here in Nebraska labor and talk constantly until we have worked up everybody on the subject, and it will be made a success.  Of course, we can't do anything unless times are better by that time.  A big crop will do more toward restoring prosperity than anything else.  But pshaw, there is no use talking about crops; it looks as though we could bank on that question for now.  I look for a change for the better after the presidential inauguration.  And as times are improving this exposition ought to catch us on the up grade and carry Nebraska right to the crest of the wave.  But it is a mighty undertaking and imposes an awful responsibility upon Omaha.  The plucky city will find itself equal to the task, however, I do not doubt.  We have been passing through a trying crisis and the turning point is just upon us.  The states ought to work harmoniously and the project will be a big success."</p>
                            <p>A. Rosenberg, one of a company at San Francisco, proprietor of one of the largest canning industries in California, was in the city during the week.  Regarding the Transmississippi exposition, Mr. Rosenberg said:  "Although absent for nearly two months from San Francisco, I remember that the exposition was, before I left, being commonly agitated by the newspapers and already more or less the topic of conversation among those who are generally the first to see the benefit to be derived from such an undertaking.  The idea of the exposition is a grand one, if it can be carried out as it is anticipated.  It ought to be the best advertisement the west has ever had, and at this time it is very opportune.  There is no reason why it should not be a big success, if each state would do its part.  I am sure that California will not be slow to do what she can.  You remember our state legislature appropriated $300,000 for the state building at the World's fair, more than any other state except Illinois, I believe.  And I think our exhibits there were something that we could all be proud of.  You may be sure that California will be on hand with as fine a representation at the Transmississippi exposition as any of her sister states.</p>
                            <p>"Yes, I think such enterprises always bring big commercial returns to the country.  It is lots of work to get them before the people and properly appreciated, but the work and time are more than compensated by the ultimate results.  California's delegation to the Transmississippi congress last fall was very much enthused over the plan and the papers are working with them to agitate it thoroughly in anticipation of the time, when interest must be shown in a more practical way, by planking down the yellow stuff, as individuals, and making appropriations as a state."</p>

                            <p>Omaha, May 22.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: It seems to me, Mr. Editor, that the best site for the great exposition of 1898, by all odds, would be Fort Omaha, Miller park and the intervening property.</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;I would suggest that the United States retain title to Fort Omaha till after the fair is over.  With proper care and judgment the $250,000 to be voted by congress might be so expended that a large percentage of the improvements might remain to bless succeeding generations.  The city could loan Miller park, getting as much permanent improvement as it is possible to have under the conditions.  There is little doubt but the property lying between Fort Omaha and Miller park could be secured on leave for a comparatively small consideration.  Then, Mr. Editor, I am free to say that the board of managers would have a site which could not be surpassed.  Yours for the trans-Mississippi,</p>

                            <p>"How are you, Transmississippi," said Colonel Downey of Laramie to the interviewer at the Paxton the other night.  "O, yes, the exposition will come out all right.  There have been a good many things liable to discourage such a movement during the present financial depression, but it will be a success.  I am just on my return from Washington where I have been attending to professional matters in the supreme court.  On making inquiry at the capitol about the prospects of that appropriation bill, I was assured by Congressman Mondell of our district that there was no opposition at all to it."  The only thing that threatens it," said the colonel anxiously, and he spoke with the wisdom of one who had "been there," "you see although there is no opposition to the exposition, some fellow may get mad and 'object,' which would spoil everything.  However, I do not think there is any doubt that the enterprise will secure government recognition.  Out in Wyoming we are all waiting to see what is the fate of the bill in congress, and people there are very much concerned about the outcome.  There is a good deal of talk about what a big thing it would be for the west, but all that is subservient to the question whether we will have it at all.  As soon as the exposition is assured by act of congress, the state and individuals will doubtless take hold at once to see what part Wyoming shall have in the exhibition.</p>
                            <p>"H. Hayes of Oakland came down to Omaha about a week ago, bringing a train load of 1,500 cattle with him over the Rockies, to place on the market.  He is one of the big ranch owners of the Pacific coast.  Regarding the exposition, he said:  'I think it will be a big thing for the west.  There is only one thing that must be secured and that is recognition by the government.  When that is obtained, the real work of the enterprise of course will begin.  I do not doubt that each state of the twenty-four will take a just pride in making a good showing for itself.  There will be a wholesome rivalry among them as to which shall leave the best impression upon the sight-seers who may be attracted from the east.  This emulation alone will be a good thing for the Transmississippi commonwealth.  You see we have been as it were under a cloud, for the past few years, and nothing could be more opportune at this time when we think we are emerging from it, for rousing us from a sort of lethargy and infusing the old life and spirit which has always characterized the west.  California will do her part.  She has always taken a conspicuous position at the front in similar undertakings and she will not be found wanting at this time.'"</p>
                            <p>"Of course it will be a big thing for the west," said E. J. Churchill, an energetic young lawyer of Cheyenne.  "And if you send another delegation like the last one which visited Cheyenne you will have the people of our state in a regular sweat of eagerness for it.  O, yes, I can speak for the citizens of our section in saying they are right in line.  And when the time comes for putting up exhibits, we shall not be slow in making as creditable a showing as possible.  There is no doubt of the success of the undertaking, with the great and resourceful country of Transmississippi states back producing it.  Not one of them can afford to be left out, as the opportunity is great, greater than any ever presented in the history of the west.  Some of the eastern states have never done much advertising so far.  They have been overshadowed more or less by the great booms of the mining regions and the consumptive and 'cure-all' climates, while real sensible advertising has been neglected."</p>
                            <p>W. A. Adams is secretary of the board of trade in the bustling little burg of Sundance, which is working all kinds of schemes to get some railroad started its way.  To hear some of the live hustlers of that place talk, one would think that Crook county might have been the garden which Rasselas left to pay the funeral expenses of the mother of Samuel Johnson, the author.  "Wyoming has always been too backward about advertising, more so than any other state of equal resources.  I believe in advertising a city, a county, a state, just as the merchant advertises his business.  We have felt the good effects of advertising at fairs, and smaller expositions, along the line of immigration.  Why half the people of the United States think that Wyoming is no good except for purposes of grazing or mining.  That is not so.  They do not know that it has some rich agricultural districts.  Crook county without any system of irrigation raises immense crops of wheat, and is the banner agricultural county of the state.  The state of Wyoming ought to be well represented at the Transmississippi exposition to make up for lost opportunities.  It is a new state and now is its chance for getting properly placed before people seeking homes and capital seeking investment.  I intend myself to try to get a commission from the government to work up the exhibits from our section of the state."</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 30.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;Congress is now engaged in handling the tailings of the session.  Adjournment is in the air.  The great appropriation bills still in congress are all that hold both houses together.  Conferees in committee rooms are swapping and trading items in strenuous efforts to reach agreement by compromise.  The routine of "morning business" in the senate, which means the introduction of bills, memorials and petitions and which ordinarily occupy two hours of the attention of that body, has simmered down to a mere fraction of its earlier importance.  The remainder of the official day is taken up with time killing debate upon <choice><sic>meausres</sic><corr>measures</corr></choice> which everyone knows cannot pass, but which operate as stop gaps between the monotonous recognition of the reports of the conference committees.  The work of the session so far as affirmative legislation is concerned is about concluded and congress is quite ready to adjourn and to attend the national conventions just as soon as the money bills are disposed of.</p>

                            <p>The pressure for recognition of measures in the house is as fierce as usual at the end of the session.  Speaker Reed is holding the reins with a firm hand and has found a coadjutor in Kem of Nebraska, who, under the impression that he is piquing the speaker, is playing daily into Mr. Reed's hands, greatly to the delight of the ruler of the house.  Every request for unanimous consent is blocked by Kem.  Every attempt to secure consideration for bills not provided for by routine or by the rules is met by an objection from the gentleman from Broken Bow.  This simply relieves the speaker from responsibility and enables him to be generous with his recognitions because he has full knowledge that Kem will prevent the bills from being taken up.  It is just about the easiest job Mr. Reed ever had and he thanks his stars every day that he refused to accord Kem recognition for the Ft. Sidney reservation bill, and thereby secured an enmity which helps him out wonderfully in his policy of holding back all bills carrying appropriations and for whose consideration unanimous request is demanded.  No doubt Kem had a right to resent Reed's refusal to favor him; but a representative with a grain of common sense would discriminate between measures.  Because Sidney cannot at once secure for a normal school the old Ft. Sidney reservation, it is certainly no reason why a Nebraska representative should exert himself to kill all other measures in which Nebraska is interested.</p>
                            <p>Kem will have a pleasant time explaining to his people at home his remarkable performance of Wednesday last in knocking out patents for Union <unclear reason="cut off"/>Nebraska district.  But the feelings of the members of the house towards Kem are too deep for expression.  Unpopular as he has always been, he has increased his <choice><sic>unppopularity</sic><corr>unpopularity</corr></choice> a thousand fold and the number of his associates who are waiting for him with a stuffed club is legion.</p>

                            <p>Washington, D. C., May 30.&#8212;Mr. Mercer tonight refused to be a member of a special party going to Nashville, Tenn.  His reason for refusing was that he has every hope of securing recognition on his exposition bill Monday.  He said that he would rather lose the pleasures of the trip to Nashville and secure the earlier passage of the exposition bill.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DAVE MERCER SECURES RECOGNITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Effort for Unanimous Consent for Its Passage Failed Through Objection of a Nebraska Member&#8212;Left for Another Day.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 5.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Omer Kem, in the face of a constituency undoubtedly in favor of the Omaha exposition bill, objected to that measure being called up in the house this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Representative Mercer endeavored to secure unanimous consent for consideration of the Omaha exposition bill.  After the reading of the bill Mr. Payne, who was acting as speaker, put the question, and immediately Mr. Kem arose and said:  "The gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Kem, objects."</p>
                            <p>The speakers gavel fell, and he stated that objection had been made.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer then made a motion to have the house go into committee of the whole for the consideration of the bill, but the motion was ruled out of order.  This disposes of the matter for today.</p>
                            <p>Pressure was brought to bear on Kem not to object, but he insisted upon his rights to oppose any and all legislation out of regular order.  Ex-Senator Paddock and Representative Hainer labored with him, but he was obdurate and the bill goes over.  Mercer says he will attempt to secure consideration at another time.</p>
                            <p>There was a moment of intense silence.  Members were amazed; none, however, more so than the other members of the Nebraska delegation.  Then a derisive cheer went up that a Nebraskan should stand in the way of a measure so vital to the interests of the transmississippi country.  Shafroth of Colorado, out of all patience, turned to Kem and in tones heard a dozen seats away, said:  "You have made the mistake of your life.  You could have made friends of every member in this house by announcing that you had grown tired of objecting and would allow the exposition bill to pass.  Instead, you have injured your party, which is on record as favoring this bill.  I am disgusted with the whole business.  Withdraw your objection and allow the bill to go through."</p>
                            <p>Kem, however, sat silent in his seat and the defeat of the exposition bill for the day was complete.</p>
                            <p>Mercer was completely dumbfounded when objection was made, as he had reasons to believe that Kem would at least absent himself from the chamber when recognition was granted.  Everything was in shape for the passage of the bill.  All of the interests had been seen to and no obstacle would have been met had not Kem unexpectedly interposed his objection.</p>
                            <p>Kem. when seen afterward, in explanation of his course, said he was heartily sorry at the defeat of the bill, but he could not consistently deviate from the course he had mapped out.  He said he was fighting on the floor of the house for a constituency without representation, and would fight until the last.  When it was suggested that the Sixth district was vitally interested in the passage of the bill he became silent.</p>
                            <p>It may be that Speaker Reed will recognize Mercer tomorrow, it being personal suspension day, but there are scores of men demanding recognition, some of whom must be placed on the list, and whether the exposition bill is to be favored will only be known when tomorrow's legislative day is far along.</p>

                            <head type="sub">OMAHA PEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Have Sent Telegrams to Both Mercer and Kem.</head>
                            <p>There was universal disappointment expressed in Omaha yesterday evening at the news from Washington concerning the exposition bill.  All along it had been known that the only difficulty in the way of securing its passage was in getting it before the house for consideration.  At first the antagonism of Speaker Reed caused uneasiness.  He objected to its consideration on the score of economy.  Although the present bill carries no appropriation, it pledges the government to make one in the future.  After persistent labor the objections of the speaker were overcome during the recent visit of Mr. Rosewater to Washington.  Congressman Mercer has been watching ever since for an opportunity to call the bill up out of its regular order by unanimous consent.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Kem has of late been objecting to the consideration of every measure out of its usual order, but it was hoped he would not block the passage of a measure in which the people of his own district, in common with the rest of Nebraska and the west, were vitally interested.  All pressure brought to bear on him up to date proved unavailing, but the friends of the measure still expect to get it up by inducing Kem to withdraw his objection, or on a general suspension day.</p>
                            <p>A special meeting of the city council was held yesterday and the following telegram was authorized to be sent to both Congressmen Mercer and Kem:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, O. M. Kem, a representative in congress from Nebraska, has by his objection delayed action by the house of representatives upon the bill pending thereon for recognition and aid to the Transmississippi exposition, proposed to be held in the city of Omaha; therefore,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, by the city council of Omaha in special session assembled, That we respectfully and earnestly urge Representative Kem to withdraw his objection and co-operate with Congressman Mercer in securing the passage of said bill, which is being favored by the people of twenty-eight states and which is of vital importance to the entire transmississippi country.</p>
                            <p>The following correspondence passed between here and Washington yesterday afternoon:</p>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, D. C., June 5, 1896.&#8212;John A. Wakefield:  I called up exposition bill just now and it would have passed, but Kem <choice><sic>obected</sic><corr>objected</corr></choice> and knocked it out.</p>

                            <p>An Omaha citizen who has given some attention to politics, said yesterday: "The friends of the big exposition bill ought not to worry themselves into quick consumption.  To a man up a tree it looks as though the exposition bill is booked for passage.  There are a great many things that lead me to the conclusion that the friends of the bill are being purposely frightened.  Mr. Mercer will pull the bill through all right at this session.  I read that in the 'tea grounds' and see it in the wool of the little African concealed in the woodpile."</p>

                            <p>Kearney, Neb., June 6.&#8212;The populist county central committee met here today and fixed July 11 as the date for holding the county convention.  While in session the attention of the members was called to the Washington dispatch in today's World-Herald regarding the action of Congressman Kem on the Omaha exposition bill, and in the discussion that followed they all seemed to think that Kem had made a mistake and they directed the chairman to send the following telegram to Mr. Kem at Washington:</p>
                            <p>O. M. Kem, Washington, D. C.: We, the county central committee of the people's independent party of Buffalo county, Nebraska, in meeting assembled, would most earnestly and respectfully request that you render your influence and work for the passage of the Omaha exposition bill, now pending before congress.  This is a matter in which the west is interested, and particularly your constituency.  We sincerely hope you will render a helping hand in this matter.  Adopted by the full committee this 6th day of June, 1896.</p>

                            <p>Cadet Taylor yesterday received this explanation from Congressman Kem regarding his objection to unanimous consent for consideration of the Omaha exposition bill, when it was called up by Representative Mercer in the house yesterday afternoon:</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mercer was interviewed today on his exposition bill.  He said: "Speaker Reed expressed his surprise to me today on the failure of the bill yesterday, and he said to me that he never had the slightest idea that Mr. Kem would object to the measure which would be so beneficial to his state and constituency."</p>
                            <p>Yesterday, when the bill came so near receiving recognition, Mr. Dingley, chairman of the committee on ways and means, arose from his chair and made ready to speak.  Mercer, knowing Dingley was strongly opposed to the bill when introduced, feared that strong opposition was coming, so he immediately went across the chamber to try to persuade Mr. Dingley not to oppose the measure.  Chairman Dingley assured Mercer that he had been completely won over to the bill, and he arose to speak a few words in its favor.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 6.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The fate of the exposition bill now hangs by a single thread, and there is grave fears that the bill will not pass this session, the action of Representative Kem being wholly responsible for this condition of affairs.  Speaker Reed is quoted as saying the he could not see how a representative could go back to his constituency after such a display of spleen, and is credited with wondering what sort of treatment Kem will be accorded when he reaches home.  Representative Mercer is non-committal as to the outlook for the bill, although he is laboring for recognition on Monday, as under the recess taken by the house tonight, the legislative day will still be Saturday.  There are, however, so many men pressing for recognition that it seems almost out of the question to expect Senator Reed to revise his personal calendar.  Mercer is satisfied that if his bill is given recognition there will be little difficulty in passing the measure.  Mercer is greatly disappointed over his defeat on Friday.  Under these considerations, the bill is in imminent danger, and all through a Nebraska congressman.</p>

                            <p>SIDNEY, Neb., June 6.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The people here regret the step taken by Congressman Kem in his objection toward the unanimous consideration of the Omaha exposition bill.  While all feel that Speaker Reed has treated the people of western Nebraska outrageously by his refusal to permit the Fort Sidney bill to be considered, they do not want the state to believe that they stand in the way of the passage of the exposition bill.  The following telegram was sent to Mr. Kem a week ago, signed by the leading citizens of this city, which is self-explanatory:  "While unqualifiedly commending your heroic efforts to pass the Fort Sidney bill, we desire you to forego any opposition likely to defeat the Omaha exposition bill.  We understand the exposition bill comes up tomorrow.  See that its defeat is not chargeable to you, or the people of western Nebraska."</p>

Mr. Kem started on his role of objector because Speaker Reed declined to grant consideration for his bill to dispose of the Fort Sidney military reservation, which has been abandoned by the government.  He announced he would object to granting unanimous consent for the passage of any measure until his bill was given a chance, and has followed out that purpose.  In defense of his action he stated to those who have been laboring with him to withdraw his objections, that he was bound to be consistent.</p>

The leading people of Sidney have telegraphed to Mr. Kem, asking him to change his attitude, as the exposition bill is of more importance to them than the Fort Sidney reservation bill.</p>
                            <p>The following telegram was received at 6 o'clock last evening:</p>
                            <p>EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, LINCOLN, Neb., June 2.&#8212;Hon. E. Rosewater:  Yours of the 30th ult. came to hand yesterday and I at once wired Mr. Kem as follows:</p>
                            <p>"Approve of your general course in insisting on recognition on behalf of your constituents.  Hope, however, you will lend every assistance possible to take up and pass Omaha exposition bill.  All our friends here endorse this sentiment."</p>
                            <p>I do not believe that he would intentionally do anything to embarrass the efforts of the Nebraska delegation in forwarding the interests of any bill intended for the benefit of Nebraska.  I believe that he will support the exposition bill.</p>

                            <p>L. C. Verplast of Deadwood, S. D., was in the city on business the first of the week.  Mr. Verplast is from Maine originally, and has been in the west for about five years.  In that time he has become thoroughly western and is always interested in anything that promises to benefit the country of the Transmississippi.</p>
                            <p>"I think it would have been difficult to select a more appropriate place for holding the exposition than Omaha.  I am quite in love with this city on general principles.  Coming west from the New England states, among the first things I missed out here were the old forest trees of that country.  The prairie was something that I couldn't get accustomed to.  Omaha has so many beautiful shade trees and lawns, and with its fine street railway system, beautiful drives&#8212;it is withal a city of which the west may be proud.  Located on the border of the western commonwealth, it is situated at the confluence of railroads where tourists may easily arrange to stop on their way to the coast.  You can accommodate a big crowd of people without any trouble if preparations are properly made.</p>
                            <p>"Expositions of the kind are always a good thing, I think.  It will demonstrate to the east what progress the country has been making since this section was denominated the wild and woolly west.  Do I like to live out here?  Ah, yes, it's a good place to live.  One thing I noticed when I came to South Dakota in the Black Hills was the peculiar lightness of the atmosphere.  It was tough on me at first.  I shouldered my rifle and went out after deer one day after my arrival, and, by George, I had to stop and sit down several times, much to the amusement of my companion, to catch my breath.  Of course we like the west or we wouldn't stay here.  Anything that will push us along ought to receive the endorsement of each of the twenty-four great and youthful states."</p>
                            <p>Colonel J. M. Paul of St. Paul was in the city the last of the week.  When shown the dispatch of the World-Herald, relating to Congressman Kem's part in promoting the cause of the exposition in congress Friday, he said, angrily:  "That man ought to be scalped.  He is a disgrace to the state, and that act alone ought to keep him from ever expecting anything again at the hands of the Nebraska people?  Does he know how many people in this country his little act affected?  We shall all hope, anyhow, that the bill will get another chance and be unanimously passed.  If we have another good year, as this one promises to be in Nebraska, and the exposition on top of that, it will set us a-flying.  Nebraska will be benefited, directly, in a great many ways.  Although it will help Omaha, it will bring lots of people west, who will want to see something of the country.  They will naturally run about our state a good deal at first, and then many of them will doubtless make a tour farther west.  Eastern capitalists will receive some idea of what a great country this is, and capital will be started this way for investment.  There is no telling all the good we may get from the exposition.  At any rate, it will be a big card for Omaha and Nebraska, as well as the entire Transmississippi commonwealth.  There has never been an undertaking in the west that promised to do us so much material good.  It is an opportunity, at the end of a period of fearful depression, for the west to recover its equilibrium and start on a high road to prosperity."</p>
                            <p>Attorney General Fowler of Cheyenne expressed himself as being very anxious to see congress make the appropriation for the exposition before it adjourned.  "We are all waiting now to see what is the outcome of that bill," said he.  "If it does not pass this session we will have to make our plans accordingly.  I would have been glad to see it tacked on to the general deficiency bill, and think it would have had a much better show.  The policy of our committee just now seems to be to wait the outcome of the congressional legislation.  Our representatives are working unitedly for the bill and seem to think that it will pass all right.  Now there seems to be nothing to be done until we know what congress is going to do.  As soon as that question is settled Wyoming will go to work, agitate the exposition and make practical plans for the getting ready a creditable exhibition of its products and resources.  Although your committee which visited us was received with the greatest possible enthusiasm, yet its visit of course accomplished nothing more than aspiring interest in it on the part of leading citizens and municipal bodies.  They seemed to have no definite plan at that time and we didn't see that we could work with them in any way until government recognition is secured and some definite plan or scale of operations is determined.  We all expect great things to come from the enterprise if it is consummated.  The feeling of the people generally is that nothing can be done until congress does its work, and then they will, I'm sure, be eager to do their share toward making as much out of its for Wyoming as they can."</p>

                            <p>The exposition bill will positively receive recognition in the house tomorrow.  Speaker Reed sent for Mr. Mercer this evening after adjournment and informed him that he should be given recognition on the exposition bill tomorrow.  Mr. Kem cannot prevent the bill being considered, because tomorrow is a suspension day and unanimous consent is not necessary.  Two-thirds of the house voting are required to secure the passage of a bill brought up on suspension day.  If there be not a quorum present Mr. Kem may succeed in further delaying the passage of the measure.  Such, however, is not likely to be the case, for Mr. Mercer will have his numerous friends on hand to assist him.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer made vigorous objections today to the consideration of the Aldrich-Underwood contested election case, and in order to pacify him the speaker made the muchly desired concession.  It is thought that every member voting will vote in favor of the bill.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 8.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Unless something at present entirely <choice><sic>unforseen</sic><corr>unforeseen</corr></choice> should interfere the Transmississippi exposition bill will pass the house tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>It is a bold statement to make in view of the vicissitudes the bill has been compelled to undergo during the past few weeks, but conditions tonight seem to warrant this assertion.  Speaker Reed has consented to recognize Representative Mercer tomorrow, and as it will be still individual suspension day, objection will not be a part of parliamentary procedure.  The house will proceed as under Saturday's legislative day, the flag over the south wing of the capitol hanging limp as a dish rag, but marking a recess, which was <choice><sic>take nlast</sic><corr>taken last</corr></choice> tonight, until the rise of another sun, the dawn of the same legislative day, but forty-eight hours removed from its original inauguration.  This is one of these legislative fictions seen during the closing days of congress, but made necessary by very exigencies of laws.</p>
                            <p>The day has been one of conference with Speaker Reed.  Not only has Mr. Mercer importuned the speaker, but a long talk was had with Mr. Reed by ex-Senator Paddock, who has taken a lively interest in the bill.  Mr. Paddock called Mr. Reed's attention to the condition of the whole transmississippi country, how it had suffered during the past few years, and showed him the bank clearings for Omaha, indicative that recovery from business depression had just commenced.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CATCHES THE SPEAKER.</head>
                            <p>He said it was a popular measure, and that the states included in the great Transmississippi country would hail this exposition as an opportunity to show the world the greatness of the western half of the continent.  There was considerable personal talk between the two of a character beyond the range of a newspaper's columns, but that the conversation was satisfactory is upon the authority of the ex-senator himself.</p>
                            <p>William Pitt Kellogg has also done yeoman service for the bill, and Mr. Reed is quoted as saying that no popular measure this session has called out such pressure as the transmississippi bill.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer, when he saw his last chance for today go down through the filibustering of the democrats on the Underwood election case, approached Speaker Reed, and a decidedly animated talk resulted within sight of the press gallery.  When they parted there was a smile on both faces.  The bill was safe.  In order that no time be lost when it is put upon its passage, Mercer will have the bill engrossed in the morning, ready for the signature of the president of the senate and the speaker of the house.  It will be rushed over to the senate, and that body will concur in the house amendment at once, and if all goes well it will be in the president's hands before the sun goes down tomorrow.  The chief executive will be seen by Mercer, Senator Warren and others, and there are no fears but that he will sign it at once, as it carries no appropriation, but simply guarantees the government to erect the building and make an exhibit at the proper time.</p>

                            <p>Grove Johnson of California, under a question of personal privilege today, indulged in what is conceded to be the most scathing denunciation of an editor of a newspaper ever heard in the lower hall of congress.  He called Hearst of the San <choice><sic>rFancisco</sic><corr>Francisco</corr></choice> Examiner a liar and other similar expressions usually tabooed in polite society, and all because that paper had made a personal attack upon him as to his conduct of the mineral lands bill.  In his speech, which attracted wide attention, he said of Mr. Omer Madison Kem of Nebraska:  "When the bill came back from the senate Kem had already engaged in that warfare which had denominated him assistant speaker of this house, and was making objection to the consideration of all bills by unanimous consent.  I know of no way to silence Kem but to kill him, but I had not money enough to pay the fine if I did that, though perhaps I would have been justified in doing it under the circumstances."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;At 6:30 o'clock this evening Representative Mercer succeeded in obtaining recognition from Speaker Reed on the Transmississippi and International exposition bill.  The bill was read at length and was about to be placed on its passage when Bailey of Texas raised a point of consideration and a count was ordered.  Mercer and Bailey were appointed tellers and 104 members voted in the affirmative to take up the bill and only one against it&#8212;Bailey of Texas.  When the result was announced the statesman from the Lone Star state raised the point of "no quorum," and a dead silence fell upon the house.  In front of the speaker's desk a crown gathered.  Payne of New York, Richardson of Tennessee and Haynes of Nebraska importuning Bailey to withdraw his point of quorum, but he would not yield and sullenly waived them aside.  A whispered conversation between Payne and Mercer followed, during the awkward position, and then Mercer announced that he would withdraw the bill.  Bailey followed by a withdrawal of his point of "no quorum" and the house proceeded to regular business.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the day Mercer had expected recognition, but one thing after another interfered to keep his bill just on the border of victory.  An hour was wasted in counting a quorum at the start, then the election case of Aldrich and Underwood was taken up and considered until 4 o'clock.  This bill out of the way everything seemed favorable for Mercer, who sat throughout the day at his desk watching for a favorable opportunity to get the exposition bill before the house.  Just as he arose, about 5 o'clock for the purpose of placing the bill on passage, conference reports commenced to come in.  Being privileged, the reports took the time of the house until 6:30, when Speaker Reed recognized Mr. Mercer.  Great interest was manifest in the bill, and its friends were abroad, the Nebraska delegation working hard to secure a favorable result, but when Bailey objected the house seemed to be under a spell.  It was the unexpected that had occurred.  When the point of "no quorum" was raised it seemed as if the whole fabric had parted, but a quiet tip from the speaker to withdraw the bill still left it among the favored measures, and tomorrow another attempt will be made to pass it.</p>

                            <p>As the house meets at 10 o'clock in continuation of the legislative day of Saturday it is confidently believed that by 11 o'clock a quorum may be secured and the bill placed on passage.  It has now the right of way and has gained strong sympathy from those who cannot conscientiously endorse the methods of Bailey.  It was Bailey of the Fifty-second congress, containing the $5,000,000 appropriation for the World's fair.  Congress was ready to adjourn and many of the members had disappeared and Bailey forced the sergeant-at-arms to require a quorum from all parts of the country.  For nine days he held the sundry civil bill in abeyance, and was only beaten by superior numbers.  He sees in the Transmississippi bill a like condition.  In a speech upon the Chicago appropriation he made the statement that not one person in 70,000 would see the World's fair, and he was therefore opposed to it.  As a matter of fact, one person in twenty-five saw the Chicago <unclear reason="torn"/>

                            the World's fair Bailey admitted in reply to a question that he had never been north of Washington.</p>
                            <p>When asked the reason of his opposition Bailey said to The Bee <choice><sic>corrsepondent</sic><corr>correspondent</corr></choice>:  "I am opposed to these schemes on principle.  The government has no right to go into the show business.  It is much better to spend the money wasted on these expositions for the betterment of the public schools.  If Galveston or Dallas wanted such an exposition I would oppose it.  If this thing goes on every Jim Crow town of 30,000 will have something to celebrate and want the government to make a show.  I was opposed to Chicago, I am opposed to Omaha, and nothing could change my idea that this exposition is out of all reason."</p>
                            <p>Mercer is sanguine that he will pass his bill tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mercer met with another failure today in attempting to secure the passage of the exposition bill.  He presented the bill to the house at 6:25 o'clock this evening and had it read.  At that time numerous other members had bills they desired considered, but Mr. Mercer was too quick for them, and Speaker Reed remembered his promise of yesterday.  When about to take a vote Representative Bailey of Texas demanded the second.  This was taken and showed 104 members in favor of the bill and Mr. Bailey and one other member opposed to it.  Mr. Bailey then made the point of "no quorum."  Many of the most prominent members begged him to withdraw his objection.  They only wasted time, however, for Mr. Bailey was deaf to all appeals.  Finally after Mr. Mercer had withdrawn the bill, Mr. Bailey withdrew his objection to "no quorum."  It was a noticeable fact that Mr. Kem was one of the 104 who voted for the bill.</p>

                            <p>After it was settled that the bill would not come up again today, the World-Herald correspondent had an interview with Mr. Bailey.  "The reason why I opposed the bill," said Mr. Bailey, "is because I am opposed to the spending of the public money in that matter.  I think that so much public money, instead of being thrown away on expositions, should be expended upon the public schools of the United States.  Money when expended upon public schools would reap great benefit to the country, while as far as education is concerned none will be acquired in an exposition."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer was seen immediately afterward and expressed his feelings in a manner that could not be misunderstood.  Tomorrow is probably the last day of the session, and Mr. Mercer will make another effort to pass the bill.  His friends claim that if he makes one more effort it will be crowned with success despite all Mr. Bailey can do.  Even Speaker Reed seemed disappointed at the failure of the bill.  Tomorrow there is to be a quorum and the friends of the bill need have no fears as to the treatment the bill will receive at its hands.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mercer, by the use of his influence, today secured the promise of the committee on naval affairs that it would keep in the naval appropriation bill the appropriation for a $100,000 torpedo boat to be built on the Missouri river.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Gamble of South Dakota today reported favorably from the committee on Indian affairs his bill confirming the title of mixed blood Indians to their lands, and allowing the same to be alienated under certain circumstances.  Affixed to the report was a letter from Indian Commissioner Browning, and the principal parts thereof are as follows:</p>
                            <p>"To the first part of this bill I do not see any particular objection, although I do not think that any necessity exists for its passage.  To the second part of the bill, allowing mixed blood Indians to sell and convey their lands and providing for a fee simple patent, I have a very serious objection."</p>

                            <p>He gives as his main reason for objections to the latter part of the bill that many Indians, full blooded and mixed, are not capable of managing their affairs directly.</p>

                            <p>Washington, D. C., June 10.&#8212;The house passed the senate bill appropriating $200,000 to aid and encourage the Transmississippi and International exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., in 1898.</p>
                            <p>The bill just passed by the house must now go to the senate for concurrence, because it contains one provision which is an amendment of the senate bill as follows:</p>
                            <p>Provided, That no liability against the government shall be incurred and no expenditure of money under this act shall be made until the officers of said exposition shall have furnished the secretary of the treasury with proofs to his satisfaction that there has been obtained by said exposition corporation subscriptions of stock (in good faith), contributions, donations, or appropriations from all sources for the purposes of said exposition, a sum aggregating not less than $250,000.</p>
                            <p>The bill directs that a Transmississippi and International exposition shall be held at Omaha from June to November, 1898.</p>
                            <p>That all exhibits from other countries shall be admitted free of duty.</p>
                            <p>That the national government shall erect a building for its exhibits at a cost of not to exceed $50,000.</p>
                            <p>That the government shall exhibit in this building such articles and material as illustrate the functions of all departments of our government in peace and war.  That the cost shall not exceed $150,000.</p>
                            <p>That medals shall be made at the United States mint for awards made to exhibitors.</p>
                            <p>That the national government shall not be liable for any debts of the exposition company.</p>
                            <p>The directors of the exposition have not pretended to do much of anything except of a routine nature for the last few weeks, realizing that the success of the enterprise depended entirely upon what action congress took in regard to this bill.  The board has held its weekly meetings regularly, and spent the time speculating upon the prospect of favorable congressional legislation.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime the Iowa legislature has appropriated $10,000 for the purpose of a state exhibit, and the friends of the exposition in that state are confident in their claims that an additional appropriation will be made the next session of the legislature, which meets in two years, as by that time the success of the exposition will be so firmly assured that there will be no hesitancy on that ground, and the great state to the east of Nebraska will want to get in with an exhibit which will be a credit to its wealth and importance.</p>
                            <p>The legislature of the new state of Utah did not make an appropriation at its session last winter, but that is easily <choice><sic>acounted</sic><corr>accounted</corr></choice> for from the reason that it was the first session of the body, and there was so much to do in connection with the advent of the territory into sisterhood, that the members had little time to give in considering measures from outside the state.  The body passed resolutions indorsing the exposition, and pledged itself to make a suitable appropriation at the session next winter.  The governor of the state has also written letters in which he has expressed a friendliness for the exposition, and promising to do what he can to get his state properly represented when the time comes.</p>
                            <p>The chamber of commerce at Los Angeles, Cal., recently passed resolutions favoring the enterprise, and urging the legislature of that state to make an appropriation of $75,000 to aid in making an exhibit such only as California can make.</p>
                            <p>A friendly expression has been received from several other states, but as Utah and Iowa were the only two states where the legislatures held a session last winter, no definite action could be secured, and the result of the work to date has been satisfactory to the directors in the highest degree.</p>
                            <p>Nine of the twenty-four states in the Transmississippi country have recognized the exposition by the appointment of state vice presidents to co-operate with the local board in the management.  No special effort was made to secure like action from the other states for the reason that congress had done nothing toward making the appropriation.  This work will also be pushed now, and the board hopes before long to have a full quota of vice presidents, backed by recognition of the exposition by all the states concerned.</p>
                            <p>The board will now get down to work in earnest, and will be encouraged by the almost assured success of the enterprise, where in the past everything was problematical.</p>

                            <head type="sub">KEM WAS UNABLE TO INTERPOSE OBJECTION</head>
                            <head type="sub">After Months of Hard Work the Efforts of the West for a Great Exhibit Are Crowned with Success.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 10.&#8212;(Special Telegram).&#8212;The Transmississippi exposition bill passed the house at 1:20 o'clock this afternoon.  There was no opposition.  The <choice><sic>bil lwas</sic><corr>bill was</corr></choice> at once hurried over to the senate for the latter's concurrence in the house amendments.  The bill has been properly engrossed for two days and it will be delivered to the president immediately.</p>
                            <p>For a short time today the prospects for the passage looked dubious in the extreme.  It would have passed last evening, but for the unexpected opposition of Congressman Bailey of Texas.  None of the many friends of the measure looked for opposition from the Texas representative.  His point of order last evening came as a complete surprise.  His defiant attitude toward the bill and his sullen refusal to withdraw his objections, even when urged to do so by many of the leading members of the house, made the bill's prospects somewhat doubtful.  But not one of the men who have worked so earnestly for the ultimate success of the measure lost hope.  Taking a quiet hint from Speaker Reed, Congressman Mercer withdrew the bill from consideration last evening, thus giving it another chance today.</p>
                            <p>The house met at 10 o'clock today with but 100 members present.  It was at first expected that the exposition bill would be given the right of way, but other legislative matters of a routine nature were called up, among them being Mondell's resolution directing the secretary of the interior to proceed at once to issue patents on Union Pacific lands, a matter of much interest to the transmississippi region.</p>
                            <p>As the time passed it was feared that the senate might finish its labors before the bill could be passed.  Senator Allen of Nebraska was on hand, doing everything in his power to further the interests of the bill, and he announced that if necessary he would, by filibustering, keep the senate in session until the exposition bill reached the president.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime Congressman Mercer was bringing his persuasive powers to bear on Congressman Bailey of Texas, whose further opposition was the one thing most to be feared.  If <choice><sic>Baily</sic><corr>Bailey</corr></choice> persisted in raising his point of order against the bill the last hope for the present session would be gone.</p>
                            <p>For fully half an hour Congressman Mercer labored with the member from Texas.  He did not fail.  Mr. Bailey agreed to absent himself from the hall when the bill was brought up.</p>
                            <p>Then another unexpected and entirely unforseen complication arose.  Representative Richardson of Tennessee insisted for consideration of the Nashville exposition bill.  There was grave danger that, with the impatience of the members to get away, both exposition bills would be lost in the <choice><sic>shu¼e</sic><corr>shuffle</corr></choice>.  <choice><sic>Agains</sic><corr>Again</corr></choice> Senator Allen's influence came in play.  He quickly assured Mr. Richardson's <choice><sic>freinds</sic><corr>friends</corr></choice> that any attempt to force the Nashville bill ahead of the Omaha bill would prove unavailing, as if necessary he would hold up the Nashville bill in the senate.  Senator Allen held the trump card and Mr. Richardson subsided.</p>
                            <p>With every obstacle out of the way Mr. Mercer waited with as much impatience as he could command for a favorable opportunity to bring up the bill.  Finally, shortly after 1 o'clock, Mr. Bailey arose and quietly proceeded to the cloak room.  As soon as possible Mercer caught the eye of Speaker Reed.  The recognition he wanted was instantly given and the Nebraska congressman called up the exposition bill.  Richardson of Tennessee remained quietly in his seat.  Mr. Mercer made the simple <choice><sic>sctatement</sic><corr>statement</corr></choice> that the bill had been read twice according to rules and moved that it be passed.  There was no friction.  The bill was put on its passage under suspension of the rules.  Speaker Reed brought his gavel down sharply and said:  "Two-thirds having seemingly voted in favor of the bill, it is passed.'  Again his gavel fell and in another instant Congressman Mercer was surrounded by the members of the house and enthusiastically congratulated on the successful outcome of the long and earnest battle for the passage of the measure.</p>
                            <p>The bill, even after it passed the house, was incomplete.  It had first to go back to the senate in order that the amendments insisted upon the house committee in ways and means could be concurred in.  Mr. Mercer had made every arrangement to expedite the journey of the bill to the senate wing of <choice><sic>teh</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> capitol.  The <choice><sic>ofrmal</sic><corr>formal</corr></choice> notification of the passage of the bill by the clerk of the house was all prepared and the messengers to carry the notification in readiness.</p>
                            <p>How Mercer's arrangement had been planned may best be judged by the fact that in just fifteen minutes from the time the bill had passed the house it had been reported to the senate.  Senator Allen had moved that the house amendments be concurred in and the senate had voted to so concur.</p>
                            <p>The signatures of the president of the senate and the speaker of the house were attached as soon as a new engrossed copy of the bill could be made.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Mercer will carry the bill to the president in person and will be accompanied by ex-Senator Paddock.  Senator Allen has arranged with Senators Allison, Pettigrew and others to keep the senate in session until tomorrow in order to give the president a chance to sign the bill.</p>
                            <p>Senator Faulkner <choice><sic>his</sic><corr>has</corr></choice> written a personal note to Private Secretary Thurber, requesting him to give the exposition bill right of way in transferring papers to the president.</p>
                            <p>Not in years has the passage of a measure affecting local interests been attended with so much interest as has the Transmississippi exposition bill.  No bill had had more determined opposition from the leading members of the ways and means committee until its merits were understood, and no bill has had more friends on the floor of the house.  Its popularity in the house has been largely due to the energetic labors of Congressman Mercer, who has worked night and day for its success.</p>

                            <p>The news that the exposition bill had passed the house spread over the city like wildfire.  It was known on the streets within ten minutes after the vote was announced in the house of representatives.  Men shook one another by the hand and mutually congratulated themselves and everybody else.  Business men assumed a satisfied air and on every hand were heard expressions of joy and predictions of improvement in the near future.  Flags were quickly displayed on public and private buildings and within a short time the city had put on a gala appearance, indicative of the joy felt by every citizen at the receipt of the long expected news.</p>
                            <p>At the Commercial club the board of governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben were at lunch and a mighty shout went up as news was told to them.  The light on the chandeliers shook with the noise and those lunching in the adjoining room came running in to see what had occurred.  The telephone was kept hot by the joyous members in calling up their respective places of business and all their friends and telling the news.  Hearty expressions of approval were heard on every side from the members and the exposition formed the sole topic of conversation.  The board of governors sent the following telegram to Representative Mercer at once:</p>
                            <p>"Hon.  D. H. Mercer:  The Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben congratulate you on your successful fight for the exposition bill.  We are with you to a finish.  Hip!  Hip!  Hurrah!</p>
                            <ab>"SAMSON, Lord High Chancellor."</ab>
                            <p>The fire bell on the engine house at Eighteenth and Harney streets, which has been discontinued as a fire alarm, was rung for several minutes to announce the glad news.</p>
                            <p>The telephones in the newspaper offices were kept going all afternoon, answering questions regarding the bill and confirming the reports circulated on the streets.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles of the Transmississippi association returned home today in time to hear the news and at once commenced making arrangements for having the event properly celebrated when the bill shall have received the signature of the president.  The other members of the directory of the association were at the fair grounds attending the races.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>President Cleveland's signature has been affixed to the bill providing government recognition and aid to the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition and appropriating $200,000 for a building and exhibit.  The measure was brought up in the house today by Mr. Mercer and passed by a unanimous vote.  Senator Allen then took it in charge and secured its passage, as amended, through the upper house, and with the executive's approval, which was at once given it, the bill became a law.</p>
                            <p>The passage of the exposition bill relieves Mr. Mercer of a great burden, which he has been bearing for some time.  The bill was brought up in the house under suspension of the rules and required two-thirds of those voting to secure its passage.  Every one who voted was in favor of the measure.</p>
                            <p>In an interview with Mr. Bailey as to why he was absent from the floor of the house when the bill received recognition, he said:  "I was down to my lunch."  The World-Herald correspondent then asked him if he was lured down to his lunch by friends of the bill, as was a current rumor in the house this afternoon.  He said:  "I desired to lunch, so, therefore, I went down to the restaurant alone.  No one had anything to do with my leaving the floor of the house."</p>

                            <p>When asked if he had been present when the bill was recognized if he would have made an active opposition, he replied that he most certainly would, and have as his reasons the same as those stated in the <choice><sic>Woarld-Herald</sic><corr>World-Herald</corr></choice> of yesterday.  However, whether there is any truth in the statement of his being lured down the stairs or not, there is one thing which is absolutely certain, and that is that three members engaged Mr. Bailey in a conversation on the river question.  Mr. Bailey did not show the least resentment, except that he did not desire anybody to think him <unclear reason="folded"/>spy or that he put in his time watching for the exposition bill to defeat it if possible.</p>
                            <p>It is quite an interesting story as to how Mr. Mercer succeeded in getting the bill through.  Mr. Bailey has started out of the house, presumably to lunch, when suddenly a member rushed into the house and said to Mr. Mercer:  "Dave, Bailey is going down to lunch."  This <unclear reason="torn"/> had hardly left when another <unclear reason="torn"/>o Mercer and announced that <unclear reason="torn"/> had reached the bottom of the <unclear reason="torn"/>  Immediately after another said:  "Mercer, I just this moment saw Bailey going into the restaurant, and I presume he was going to lunch."  About five minutes later a member from the west announced that Mr. Bailey had given his order to the waiter for a few delicacies of the season on which he was going to lunch.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mercer by this time had unlocked the drawer of his desk and abstracted the bill which he was going to make another mighty effort to pass.  He had just taken it out when another member rushed in breathlessly and stated <choice><sic>betwen</sic><corr>between</corr></choice> gasps that Mr. Bailey was down in the restaurant and when seen by him had just secured his lunch and was in the act of masticating the first mouthful.  Mercer immediately seized upon the golden opportunity and asked for recognition, which was instantly granted by Speaker Reed.  The bill was not even read, but the title was announced, and a vote taken within the space of two minutes, which resulted in the unanimous passage of the bill.  The time was so quick that it is claimed Mr. Bailey did not even have time to swallow the first mouthful of food he had taken.</p>
                            <p>The speaker used his gavel in vain trying to quiet the mighty shouts and handclapping that resulted from the passage of the bill.  After the passage of the bill Mr. Mercer spent the greater portion of the day in receiving the congratulations of his numerous friends in the house and senate.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT.</head>
                            <p>The bill was quickly finished by the senate, and armed with it, Mr. Mercer started for the White house.  As he went into the mansion he passed the president's messenger carrying to the house the president's veto to the Fort Omaha military reservation bill.  Not knowing that, he hastened in and in a few minutes' time came out triumphantly with the signature of the president attached to the exposition bill.  Many members remarked about the expansive smile which Mr. Mercer wore the rest of the day.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hopkins of Illinois in an interview with the World-Herald correspondent, said:  "At the start the ways and means committee was strongly opposed to the exposition bill, but we changed our views on account of the persistence of Mr. Mercer in the work for the bill and because Mercer thoroughly convinced us that the only thing to do was to pass the bill.  I am highly delighted at the passage of the bill and am seriously thinking of commencing the construction of buildings on my lots in Omaha, for the exposition is sure to boom that place."</p>
                            <p>Representative Dolliver said:  "Mr. Mercer is an exceedingly successful man in all legislation undertaken by him."</p>

                            <p>Mr. Payne said that Mercer was the one man of the house who could get an exposition bill through congress, and that he had shown himself to be a man untiring in his efforts to do that for his <choice><sic>constitutuents</sic><corr>constituents</corr></choice> which was desired by them.</p>
                            <p>It will not do to take up too much space, so I will state that between thirty-five and forty other members expressed themselves in a like strain.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kem was missed from the floor of the house, where he could have killed considerable time today, and upon inquiry, it was learned that he left, in the company of Representative Heatwole, at 11 o'clock this morning for Omaha.  While on the train Heatwole sent a telegram to Mercer in which he said:  "Kem is gone, hasten the bill."</p>
                            <p>Representatives Hainer and Andrews deserve credit for the way in which they assisted Mr. Mercer.  Both of them did everything they could, and that is saying a great deal.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FORT OMAHA BILL VETOED.</head>
                            <p>The main reasons for the president's veto of the Fort Omaha bill are as follows:  "The sale of Fort Omaha was to partially pay for the new site of the post.  The authority to sell and remove any of the buildings from the old reservation to the new site still remains, however, unimpaired.  In this condition of affairs it is now proposed to lease this land and buildings to the state of Nebraska at a nominal rent, allowing the government to repossess then only when the interests of the United States shall require such action.  Of course, it would be claimed that this language, in view of the statute of 1888, should not be construed as permitting the government to retake the property for the purpose of selling it, because that is not stipulated in the bill.  Furthermore, it would be plausibly argued that the lease was paramount to the power of sale contained in the law of 1888, and that the omission of any provision that possession might be resumed for the purpose of sale plainly indicated that the interest of the United States, which allows such resumption, contemplates some other and different emergency.</p>
                            <p>"As a practical question we all know that transactions of this character relating to government property amount to a permanent alienation, or certainly pave the way for an absolute grant.  I do not think there should be anything done with this valuable property which will in the least embarrass the government in its sale, and to that extent reimbursing itself for the cost of the new military post, which was plainly contemplated in the law of 1888."</p>

No special effort was made to secure like action from the other states for the reason that congress had done nothing toward making the appropriation.  This work will also be pushed now, and the board hopes before long to have a full quota of vice-presidents, backed by recognition of the exposition by all the states concerned.</p>

                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/>when invited to respond to an impromptu toast,, talked jubilantly of the situation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. C. F. Weller, president of the Commercial club, responded to the introductory toast, "Past Work of the Club," in which he reviewed the achievements of the two years gone by, and the steps leading up to the great Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FUTURE OF THE CLUB.</head>
                            <p>Mr. J. H. Dumont, in presenting the "Future Work of the Club," believed that the plans of the past should be pushed forward with unabated vigor, and especially should every effort be given to make Omaha a great convention city.  In speaking of new projects needed at once, Mr. Dumont mentioned a wholesale dry goods house, with a capital of at least $500,000, and a union depot, more advertising and a better grade of it.  The club should at a moment's notice be prepared to give all the information necessary regarding Omaha and its business interests.</p>
                            <p>Although the club has ruled that politics shall not become a part of the club life, yet Mr. Dumont believed that it could consistently urge new laws for better local government, and pure food laws, which should prevent the manufacture and sale of adulterated articles of diet; to aid in securing municipal ownership and control of lighting and water plants.</p>
                            <p>In regard to manufacturing institutions, the speaker believed that the giving of large bonuses would result in failure, and that it would be far better to encourage smaller institutions to locate under natural conditions.  The problem of securing better railroad rates, he believed, must be solved before Omaha could become a great commercial center.  With judicious and harmonious action by the individual members of the club, rates due to Omaha may in all probability be secured.  An outlet by railroad to the lakes, or to some other point than Chicago, will, he believed, bring it about and would adjust the long and short haul difficulties of today, and make the Missouri river a basic point.  In regard to the proposed Yankton &amp; Southwestern railway, if built, he believed it would be disastrous to Omaha, as it would create a rainbow route around the city.</p>

                            <p>"The Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben" was the topic of which Major R. S. Wilcox treated.  He briefly traced the history of the organization, and spoke with satisfaction of the Mondamin festival of last year.  He called attention to the fact that the directors received no direct benefit from the parade, and also that almost all of the $16,000 of expense of last year was spent in the city, and all would be this year.  He concluded with <unclear reason="cut off"/></p>
                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/>the best ever held."  He asserted that the Omaha people had done magnificently last year.  Briefly criticising the distance of location, and the insufficient transportation facilities, he said he had received assurances that the distance this year would be measured by minutes and not by miles.</p>
                            <p>"We are safe in estimating that the state fair of 1896 will leave half a million dollars in the city of Omaha," said he in conclusion.</p>
                            <p>In presenting the topic, "Jobbing Trade of Omaha, Present Outlook," Mr. Allen T. Rector began with a sunshiny talk on "Look Up, Not Down," commenting upon Nebraska's enormous crops of 1893, the prospects of a 25 per cent increase this year, and Omaha's brilliant showing at the head of the bank clearings column.  And from all the adversity the Omaha jobbers have driven the Chicago jobbers from the surrounding country, leaving the Omaha jobber to repeat with Alexander Selkirk: 'I'm monarch of all I survey.'"</p>
                            <p>Mr. Edmund M. Bartlett, chairman of the executive committee of the Commercial Law league of America, spoke briefly of the coming convention of that body in Omaha this year.  He assured the club that at least 1,500 delegates, many accompanied by their wives, would be the guests of the city.  They must be royally welcomed.</p>
                            <p>He urged that every means possible be used to entertain the guests, for "never before," said Mr. Bartlett, "has such a glorious opportunity been given to advertise Omaha throughout this broad land," and with a humorous story he concluded.</p>

                            <p>W. B. Taylor preceded his response to the toast "Real Estate and Its Relations to the Prosperity of Omaha," by offering this resolution, which was unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the chairman be authorized to send a telegram to Senator Allen and Representative Mercer expressing our hearty approval and high appreciation of the efforts of our friends in congress, particularly Speaker Reed, Senators Allen and Thurston, and Representative Mercer, in national recognition of and appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>
                            <p>He then discussed the relations of real estate men with the business world.</p>
                            <p>"The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition in Omaha in 1898" was discussed by Mr. E. Rosewater.  Beginning with a reminiscence of December 3, 1863, when the first spadeful of dirt was thrown for the Union Pacific railway in Omaha, he spoke of an address by Andrew J. Poppleton, who on that day mounted a wagon and began:</p>
                            <l>This is the day we long have sought,</l>
                            <l>And worried because we found it not.</l>
                            <p>"So with the coming of the great exposition, the preparation of which will involve the building of a new $2,000,000<unclear reason="cut off"/></p>

                            <p>E. M. Bartlett spoke of the coming of the Commercial Law League of America to this city and appealed for aid in entertaining the 1,500 visitors.  He urged all true Omahans to lay aside their bickering and to join hands in a mighty effort to build up the city.</p>
                            <p>Edward Rosewater spoke briefly upon the Transmississippi exposition.  He said that on December 3, 1863, he had stood on the river bank near the foot of Farnam street and witnessed the digging of the first spadeful of earth preparatory to the beginning of the Union Pacific railway.  At that time Andrew J. Poppleton exclaimed:</p>
                            <l>This is the day we long have sought,</l>
                            <l>And mourned because we found it not.</l>
                            <p>That was the way he felt over the passage of the exposition bill.  He said that with the exposition would come a new union depot, greater hotel accommodations, a great market house, an auditorium, better street railway service, and the removal of the wooden pavements.  He moved that a telegram be sent to Senator Allison thanking him for the assistance the Iowa delegation had rendered in securing the passage of the bill.  The motion prevailed.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock closed the program with an address on "The New Omaha."  He advocated a friendly alliance with the west and made a strong plea for the support of western products, not barring the white metal.</p>

                            <p>The consensus of local opinion among citizens of all parties is that Congressman Mercer deserves the highest praise for his work in behalf of the exposition bill.  While Mercer's name is on everybody's tongue, the runners of other candidates for congress are active in charging that Mercer had resorted to a mean political trick in holding the bill till the end of the session.  We doubt very much, however, whether such detraction will inure to the benefit of anybody who aspires to fill Mercer's shoes.</p>

                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi and International exposition to be held at Omaha was the chief topic of conversation today in the lobbies of the senate and house of representatives.  The senators claim that most of the credit for the bill's passage should be given to Senator Allen.  They say, and it is true, that the senator was the originator of the bill.  The original bill was introduced in the senate by him on January 3, and was referred to the committee on international expositions, of which Senator Thurston of Nebraska was chairman.  While in that committee Senator Thurston did all in his power to further the interest of the bill.</p>
                            <p>At first the bill was not received favorably in the senate, but Senator Allen being a man of great influence in that body, soon succeeded in overcoming all obstacles and as a result the bill passed.  After passing the senate, the bill was sent to the house, where after long and numerous delays it was passed yesterday.</p>
                            <p>The members of the house claim that most of the credit should be given to Mr. Mercer, for they say that though it passed the senate it might have failed to pass the house had it not been for the work of Mr. Mercer.  To the credit of both Senator Allen and Mr. Mercer it must be said that if men ever labored unceasingly and apparently tirelessly in the interests of their constituents they most certainly did.</p>

                            <p>The good effects of the exposition law are already felt.  To the prospective investor it makes the way clear; to the property owner it gives confidence, and to everybody, delight.  Yet the passage and approval of this important measure imposes upon Omaha and her people a load of responsibility and hard work such as they have never before assumed.  Somebody's brains and somebody's money are now in active requisition.  Both are here in great abundance.  All that was needed to put them into motion was an exposition bill.</p>

A task compared with which all other public enterprises espoused by Omaha dwarf into insignificance will be imposed upon the leading men of this city by the success of the bill.  The exposition is not, strictly speaking, an Omaha enterprise, but our people cannot evade the responsibility of providing a place for it and arranging all the preliminaries for the greatest exhibit of resources and produces the west has ever attempted.</p>

                            <p>From the day the exposition measure was introduced in the senate by Senator Allen, that gentleman has been persistent in <unclear reason="covered"/> advocacy.  When it was returned from the house yesterday Senator Allen prevented an adjournment of the senate and the prompt concurrence of that body by threatening to deliver one of his famous fourteen-hour speeches.  Senator Allen also did effective work in the house.</p>
                            <p>From the day that the measure first reached the house Congressman Mercer has devoted to it his best energies and his most watchful care.  Many other men would have been discouraged, but Mr. Mercer has worked under great difficulties with a determination and fidelity that have been well-rewarded.</p>
                            <p>The World-Herald desires to assure Congressman Mercer and Senator Allen that their good efforts are thoroughly appreciated by the people of Nebraska and they will both receive a warm welcome on their return home.</p>
                            <p>Nor must we forget ex-Senator A. S.

                            <p>The people of Nebraska thank these gentlemen right cordially for their good work.</p>

                            <p>Senator Thurston is a candid man, but his best friends were hardly prepared for such new evidence of candor as it found in his latest interview.</p>
                            <p>In an interview had with Senator Thurston at St. Louis and published in yesterday's Omaha Bee, the senator said that he believed the Indiana declaration would form the model upon which the money declaration in the national platform would be based.</p>

                                <p>Replying to your letter asking my opinion of the proposition to hold an exposition of the trans-Mississippi states at Omaha in 1898 I beg to say:</p>
                                <p>I am a firm believer in expositions, national and international.  They accomplish great good, and, so far as I have been able to find from a careful study, do no harm.  The Cotton States and International exposition, which was held at Atlanta from September 18 to December 31, inclusive, was of vast benefit to the entire country.  The people of the north, east, south and west came to understand each other better and nothing ever happened in this country to allay sectional feeling and overcome the bitterness engendered during the late war more than this.</p>
                                <p>As a means of exhibiting the growth and development, as shown by the splendid <choice><sic>exhibt</sic><corr>exhibit</corr></choice> of the products of the south in field, mine and factory, nothing could have been more successful or accomplished better results.  A trans-Mississippi exposition would be of corresponding benefit to that portion of our country and of great interest to the states this side of the river.  It would afford a splendid opportunity for the people of the two great divisions of the United States to know, understand and appreciate each other.</p>
                                <p>I sincerely trust that a trans-Mississippi exposition will be held and that I may have the pleasure of being a visitor.</p>

                                <p>It seems to me that the proposition to hold an exposition of the trans-Mississippi states at Omaha in 1898 is a most excellent one.  Such a fair would be a most valuable educator of the people, especially those living in the east, who have no fair conception of the vast and varied resources of the middle west and the sunset states.  Unreasonable as it may seem to the man of travel and broad experience, the opinion prevails in the east that the west produces more real estate boomers and outlaws than anything else.  The relations of the two sections have become closer as their interests have become more common and they will be materially strengthened by any enterprise that faithfully expresses and reveals the importance of the agricultural, mineral and lumber districts of the west.</p>
                                <p>In my opinion no more favorable point could have been selected for the proposed exposition than Omaha, because of its central location and the ease with which it may be reached from all the populous sections of the north, east, south and west.  The scheme, if carried forward, will undoubtedly be successful and the results must be of great benefit to the whole country.  I have for it good and sincere wishes.</p>

                                <p>The United States seems to have entered upon an era of expositions.  The magnificent success of the World's fair was followed by the California Midwinter exposition, and that by the marvelous enterprise of the Cotton States exposition at Atlanta.  The Pacific and southern states, having reaped a large harvest of honor, and having sown seed that must yield a large return as soon as the vexed question of tariff and currency are settled, the great west proposes a display of its resources.</p>
                                <p>At the last session of the trans-Mississippi congress it was unanimously determined that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river be made at Omaha.</p>
                                <p>It is needless to expatiate on the advantage to be derived from an exhibition of the products and resources of the great states that lie between the Mississippi and the Rockies.  There is not an industry in any part of the republic that will not be stimulated in some degree thereby.</p>
                                <p>The congressional appropriation should be followed by state  appropriations.  The new state of Utah and the older commonwealth of Iowa may be expected to be peculiarly zealous in a matter so intimately connected with their welfare.</p>

                                <p>Your favor is received asking my opinion of the proposition to hold an exposition of the trans-Mississippi states at Omaha in 1898.</p>
                                <p>I cannot think very favorably of it.  No better or more convenient point could be selected for such an exposition.</p>
                                <p>Omaha is closely allied to the mining states of the west, to the grazing states of the south and to the great grain producing states north of it.  It is the center of vast and diversified trade, embracing grain, cattle, smelting and manufacturing.  All of the varied industries of the trans-Mississippi states are represented in that city.</p>
                                <p>It is, too, accessible from every quarter, having immense railroad facilities.</p>
                                <p>For these reasons such an exposition could not be otherwise than successful, in my opinion.</p>

                            <p>South Omaha people were greatly gratified yesterday afternoon at the news from Washington that the Exposition bill had passed and Congressman Mercer was being complimented on all sides.  Citizens of the Magic City would very much like to see the exposition grounds located at Riverview park or on the large flat west of the city and near Seymour park.  Some time ago the Municipal league appointed a committee to do what it could toward locating the grounds near this city, and now that the bill has passed, the committee will no doubt make a determined effort in that direction.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Delegates Adopt a Strong Sound Money Platform.</head>
                            <p>HARTFORD, Conn., June 10.&#8212;The democratic state convention to select delegates to the national convention at Chicago and presidential electors met here today with a full attendance of delegates.  M. B. Cary was made temporary chairman, and other temporary officers were elected.</p>
                            <p>In his speech on assuming the chair Mr. Carey claimed consideration for the independent voters, to whom several recent victories of the democratic party were due.  He scouted the proposition to reopen the fight on the tariff issue, and declared that the fight now is, and must be, on the currency question.  He asked that the convention's platform be made to contain an unequivocal declaration for the single standard and that bimetallism in all its forms be disavowed.</p>
                            <p>He spoke in praise of President Cleveland and ex-Governor Russell as uncompromising opponents of a debasement of the currency, whose leadership the democracy could safely follow.  Relative to presidential nominees, Mr. Cary said he hoped that the convention at Chicago would select a man whose lips were not sealed on the question of the day, or one whose attitude could be a matter of doubt.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Waller, who was made permanent chairman, spoke briefly on assuming the gavel and the report of the committee on resolutions was adopted.</p>
                            <p>On the subject of the currency the platform says:</p>
                            <p>It is a necessary requirement of the honest payment of public debts and the preservation of the public credit that the gold standard of money as a measure of value shall be maintained.</p>
                            <p>While we favor the most liberal use of silver consistent with the enforcement of a gold standard we are unalterably opposed to the free coinage of silver, deeming it a device for the debasement of our currency and compulsory purchase of silver of the government.  Under existing circumstances to pay public debts in silver coin is repudiation, to pay provisional debts in coins to the wage earners and to provide for the free coinage of silver means the destruction of legitimate business and great suffering among the laboring classes.  We believe that the safety of sound banking by which a bank note currency ample to supply the needs of the whole country shall be created, safely secured and always and everywhere redeemable in gold.</p>
                            <p>The platform also endorses the administration of President Cleveland, and especially approves his firm support of the public credit and his exemplification of the Monroe doctrine.</p>
                            <p>The selections made at the caucuses last night for delegates to Chicago were ratified by the convention as follows:  Delegates-at-large&#8212;First district, Miles B. Preston of Hartford; Second district, Lynde Harrison of Guilford; Third district, Thomas L. Waller of New London; Fourth district, James M. Alldis of Torrington.  County Delegates&#8212;Hartford, Edward D. Coogan of Windsor Locks; Tolland, Lyman T. Tingler of Vernon; New Haven, William A. Kennedy of Nauguatuck; Middlesex, Horace R. Butler of Middletown; New London, William H. Shields of Norwich; Windham, Fred A. Morrill of Putnam; Litchfield, Charles K. Lyman of Washington; Fairfield, Michael J. Houlihan of Newton.</p>
                            <p>In deference to the wishes of ex-Governor W. E. Russell of Massachusetts, expressed in a letter to Lynde Harrison, the delegates were not instructed on the subject of presidential candidates.</p>

                            <p>A meeting of the German American Republican club was held last night for the purpose of getting in shape for the campaign.  Resolutions were passed, copies of which are to be sent to the national convention, favoring a protective tariff and opposing the free and unlimited coinage of silver.</p>
                            <p>A resolution was also adopted expressing appreciation of the work of Congressman Mercer in securing the passage of the Transmississippi exposition bill and pledging him support for re-election.</p>
                            <p>A congratulatory telegram was sent Mr. Mercer as follows:</p>
                            <p>German Republican club congratulates you on your successful efforts in behalf of exposition bill.</p>
                            <p>A committee was appointed to devise plans for the organization of the German American republicans of the county.</p>

                            <p>A story is told upon apparently trustworthy authority tonight that the Iowa delegation to St. Louis will follow the lead of Manley in admitting the nomination of McKinley on the first ballot and go further than the Maine leaders and not allow Allison's name to be presented to the convention.  In this case it is said efforts will be made to secure the nomination for the vice presidency of Senator John H. Gear.</p>
                            <p>Gear's friends are now quietly at work among the delegates of other states, and feelers are being put out.  Some ten days ago the Iowa delegation had about concluded to advise Allison to withdraw from the race, but friends of Allison in Washington objected.  Now the story goes that Allison realizes that McKinley is bound to win and desires to help the republicans of Iowa by permitting them to climb into the band wagon without delay.  The withdrawal of Allison is said to be assured if the prospects for Gear's nomination brighten.</p>

                            <p>St. Louis, June 10.&#8212;Senator Proctor, who has been mentioned as a candidate for vice president, says:  "I do not want to be vice president of the United States.  My name shall not be presented for that office before the republican national convention.  Whenever I am sure such a condition is probable I shall take steps to prevent it.  I don't know a great deal of politics.  I do know something about Vermont politics, however, and I know that republicanism of my state is five to one for McKinley.  He will surely win on the first ballot."  The Vermont senator says the republican platform should be so phrased that nobody the world over could mistake, distort or argue its meaning, and that meaning should be unqualifiedly for a single money standard.</p>

                            <p>DES MOINES, Ia., June 10.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The republican county committee has prepared rules for the government of the primary election in this county, to be held June 26.  At that time the county will vote on delegates to the county convention, which will name delegates to the congressional convention at which the fight will be between Berryhill and Hull, both of this county.  There has been much dissension regarding the votes for the primaries, on which each side felt that a great deal depended.  The Hull men claim a victory in the adoption of a rule which will not allow all persons who voted the republican ticket in the spring election to vote as republicans at this primary.  They charge that the Berryhill men wanted such a rule, and that it would have let 500 democrats vote for Berryhill.  The Berryhill men claim to be satisfied with the regulations adopted.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 10.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;After one of the most ably conducted and desperate contests in the history of similar legislation, the Transmississippi and International exposition bill has passed both houses of congress and received executive approval.</p>
                            <p>Although the people have been fully informed of the status of this bill from day to day, it is not too late to say that its friends in both branches of congress have done their full duty.  Rarely has a similar measure met with such opposition, and seldom has such a contest been so ably conducted.  It will become a matter of history that Senator Allen held congress in session several hours to secure the presidential signature to the Omaha exposition bill.  But the bill was signed within half an hour of its presentation to the president.</p>
                            <p>Never has there been such <choice><sic>exepdition</sic><corr>expedition</corr></choice> of work on behalf of a popular measure as characterized the progress of this bill today.  At 1:24 today it passed the house.  It went immediately to the senate, and at 1:50 today it passed that body.  It had been enrolled for twenty-four hours, waiting for an opportunity to be placed upon its passage, a trick of legislature procedure absolutely essential in the closing days of congress.  Immediately after passage it was signed by Speaker Reed and by the president of the senate.  Eight bills had precedence in the senate, but Senator Allen forced recognition for the measure.  At 3 o'clock the bill had been enrolled and engrossed upon the senate side, and was ready to be carried to the president.  Representative Mercer acting as messenger.  At 4:30 it was placed in the hands of the president by Private Secretary Thurber, together with a number of telegrams and personal notes, asking for favorable consideration, and at 5 o'clock the president had affixed his signature to the same.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BAILEY WENT TO EAT.</head>
                            <p>The passage of the transmississippi bill was <choice><sic>acompanied</sic><corr>accompanied</corr></choice> by a great display of clever tact.  Mercer had with him a coterie of the best workers in congress.  When he had concluded his talk with Bailey of Texas and the latter had intimated that he was not fighting Omaha, Mercer suggested that Bailey take lunch, which was accepted.  When Bailey entered the corridor on his way to the restaurant, it was reported to Mercer.  "He is seated at a table in a private room," said the scout posted on lookout.  "He has ordered a large meal," said this faithful follower of Bailey's movement.</p>
                            <p>Then information came that Mondell of <unclear reason="torn"/>gaged Bailey in a conversation <unclear reason="torn"/> silver question.</p>
                            <p>Then another unexpected and entirely unforeseen complication arose.  Representative Richardson of Tennessee insisted on consideration of the Nashville exposition bill.  There was grave danger that, with the impatience of the members to get away, both exposition bills would be lost in the shuffle.  Again Senator Allen's influence came in play.  He quickly assured Mr. Richardson's friends that any attempt to force the Nashville bill ahead of the Omaha bill would prove unavailing, as if necessary he would hold up the Nashville bill in the senate.  Senator Allen held the trump card and Mr. Richardson subsided.</p>
                            <p>With every obstacle out of the way Mr. Mercer waited with as much patience as he could command for a favorable opportunity to bring up the bill.  Finally he caught the eye of Speaker Reed.  The recognition he wanted was instantly given and the Nebraska congressman called up the exposition bill.  Richardson of Tennessee remained quietly in his seat.  Mr. Mercer made the simple statement that the bill had been read twice according to rules and moved that it be passed.  There was no friction.  The bill was put on its passage under suspension of the rules.  Speaker Reed brought his gavel down sharply and said:  "Two-thirds having seemingly voted in favor of the bill, it is passed."  Again his gavel fell and in another instant Congressman Mercer was surrounded by the members of the house and enthusiastically congratulated on the successful outcome of his long and earnest battle for the passage of the measure.</p>
                            <p>report was brought to Mercer, the bill was passed.</p>

                            <p>Within an hour of the time of the passage of the bill a number of telegrams were received by Mercer from Omaha giving him encouragement and advice as to how to proceed in the fight, and urging him forward.  While these telegrams brought peace to Mercer's soul, it must not be forgotten that other members of the Nebraska delegation in the city labored zealously for the passage of the bill.  Allen in the senate did yeoman service.  He was indefatigable in <unclear reason="cut off"/></p>

                            <p>With barely two years before the gates of the exposition are to be thrown upon the railroads, like others, must soon begin to prepare.  They will have a large increase in passenger traffic and they must take care of it.  If they have hesitated heretofore they must no hesitate no longer.  A spirit of confidence and enterprise is again aroused in this city and the railroads will be drawn into a full participation in the undertakings proposed for the good of Omaha.

                            <p>Ex-United States Senator Paddock never forgets Nebraska and the west.

                            <p>Senator Allen is a man of whom Nebraska will always be proud.  True and loyal to his constituents, he hastened the exposition bill through the senate on its final passage.</p>

                            <p><unclear reason="cut off"/> I do not recall greater vicissitudes met by any popular measure than experienced by this bill.  First, the opposition of Kem and then of Bailey worked to the disadvantage of the measure.  Providence removed Kem from the city and then Bailey was taken care of.  All tribute to Mercer, who passed the bill without a quorum on the floor.  I send greetings to Omaha and hope for a magnificent exposition."</p>
                            <p>Hartman of Montana, who worked shoulder to shoulder with the Nebraska delegation for the success of the bill, said: "Mercer has made a persistent and courageous fight for the bill and Omaha deserves to be congratulated alike with her people upon the result of his efforts which culminated today in the passage of the bill.  The original idea of holding an exposition of this character for the purpose of bringing to the notice of the world at large the productive capacities of the transmississippi states was indeed a happy one.  In no other way can a greater degree of publicity be given the many resources of those states, and it is only necessary to say that with the greater knowledge of the resources and possibilities an influx of population will come and in no distant day, in my judgment, will shift the population of the country from its present center farther toward the west.  You may put me down for the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">WHY FORT OMAHA SUFFERED.</head>
                            <p>As Assistant Secretary Pruden left the white house with the veto message of the president on the Fort Omaha military reservation bill, Mercer, with the exposition bill, entered the president's apartments.  It was a decided coincident, remarked after the veto message was read in the house late in the evening.  The veto <choice><sic>messafge</sic><corr>message</corr></choice> recalls the legislation of July, 1888, providing for a new military reservation in Nebraska, refers to the proposition in the pending bill to lease the old reservation and <choice><sic>buildinfs</sic><corr>buildings</corr></choice> at a normal rent and to the provision allowing the government to repossess the reservation, only "when the interests of the United States shall require such action."  The president then says: "Of course it would be claimed that this language in view of statute of 1888 should not be considered as permitting the government to retake the property for the purpose of selling it, because that is not stipulated in the bill.  For that reason it would be plausibly urged that the lease was paramount to the power of sale, contained in the law in 1888, that the omission of any provision that possession might be resumed for the purpose of sale plainly indicated that the interests of the United States, which allows such resumption, contemplates some other different emergency.  We all know that transactions of this character relating to government property amount to a <choice><sic>jermanent</sic><corr>permanent</corr></choice> alienation, or certainly paved the way for an absolute grant.  I do not think there should be anything done with this valuable property, which will in the least embarrass the government in its sale, and to that extent reimbursing itself for the cost of the new military post, which was plainly contemplated in the law of 1888."</p>
                            <p>Immediately after the reading Mercer moved that the message be referred to the committee on military affairs, which was done.  Had Cleveland waited four hours longer the bill would have become a law without his signature, the ten days being up at 6 o'clock this evening.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ANDREWS IS ENTHUSIASTIC.</head>
                            <p>Representative Andrews said,  "Good for Omaha, Nebraska and the Transmississippi country and praise for Mr. Mercer in his splendid fight against the embarrassments of the past few weeks.  With one exception the members of the Nebraska delegation have supplemented his efforts in every possible way.  Success to the exposition.  With genial showers, followed by rich harvests and restoration of business and prosperity our people will come to the exposition with such a display of products of their soil and labor as will demonstrate to the whole country the almost boundless resources of the Transmississippi region and strengthen our financial credit at home and abroad.  Let the good work go on."</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen said:  "Never in my whole legislative career have I felt so much interest in the outcome of any measure as in the exposition bill.  Its signature by the president gives assurance of great success.  It means new life, new hope for the Transmississippi country, and for the sake of the state I am content to have assisted in the passage of so important a measure."</p>
                            <p>Ex-Senator Paddock when he saw the president stated that if the bill would be signed Omaha would in the next five years show a larger percentage of increase than any city in the United States.</p>
                            <p>"How do you know this?" said Mr. Cleveland.</p>
                            <p>"I do not know it; it is only my opinion, but I will stake my reputation as a prophet," said Paddock, as he left the White house.  When the bill was signed a telegraphic message came to the <choice><sic>capittol</sic><corr>capitol</corr></choice> with this message from the president:  "I will hold Paddock to his statement about the increase of population."</p>
                            <p>As for Mr. Mercer, it is needless to say he is happy, for he passed the bill on the anniversary of his marriage day and sent to his wife this laconite but joyful message:  "Bill is passed; kiss the baby."</p>

                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/>er said:  "It is a <unclear reason="torn"/>y for Nebraska and the north-west.  The contest was long and stubborn.  While hard times make an exposition very desirable to the city, state and section securing it, a bankrupt treasury presented an ugly obstacle.  Added to this the efforts made for the Nashville exposition, Kem's objections and Bailey's opposition, each in turn caused serious complications, which seemed certain to defeat the measure.  Victory came at last because the business men of Omaha put up a plucky, brainy fight, because the measure had merit which made it friends; because our neighbors were all loyal and helpful, and last, but not least, because the Omaha district is represented by a man whose name is a synonym for tact, good nature <choice><sic>an dthose</sic><corr>and those</corr></choice> other splendid qualities which have made Dave Mercer the ideal hustler.  His tact and deserved popularity won the fight at the critical moment.  We are assured of governmental co-operation.  Now for the exposition itself.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hainer succeeded in passing through both houses at a late hour today a resolution extending the time of payment for one year on part of all purchasers on Indian reservations.  This will be good news for settlers on the Otoe and Missouri Reservations in Gage county, who have been fearful of eviction, pending the settlement of their interests.  Hainer, with Sayers of Texas, will see the president in the morning and ask his signature to the resolution, which in all probability, will be secured before congress adjourns.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HAD FRIENDS EVERYWHERE.</head>
                            <p>Not in years has the passage of a measure affecting local interests been attended with so much interest as has the Transmississippi exposition bill.  No bill had had more determined opposition from the leading members of the ways and means committee until its merits were understood, and no bill has had more friends on the floor of the house.  Its popularity in the house has been largely due to the energetic labors of Congressman Mercer, who has worked night and day for its success.</p>
                            <p>The exposition bill was originally introduced in the upper branch of congress passed there without opposition.  As originally drawn it provided for the expenditure of $250,000 by the gov-<unclear reason="cut off"/> much effort to overcome the objections of Chairman Dingley, the bill was referred to a subcommittee of five, with Grosveenor of Ohio chairman.  For some reason Grosvenor withheld action and a delay of many days occurred, during which a delegation of Omaha citizens, headed by President Wattles of the exposition company, visited this city in the interest of the measure.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SOME CHANGES AGREED TO.</head>
                            <p>Finally the bill was favorably reported by the subcommittee to the full committee.  After several conferences with Chairman Dingley the Omaha delegation agreed to accept several amendments to the senate bill.  One of these reduced the appropriation for the government exhibit to $200,000 and that none of the government's appropriation should be expended until proof had been furnished the secretary of the treasury that there had been obtained from all sources for the purposes of the exposition a sum aggregating not less than $250,000.</p>
                            <p>These amendments were incorporated in the bill.  After the bill had been favorably reported to the house it went to the calendar, where it remained for many weeks.  Speaker Reed was yet to be won over to the measure.  But even the speaker's opposition was overcame by the efforts of Mr. Rosewater of Omaha, who made a special visit to this city on behalf of the bill.</p>
                            <p>Twice within the past few days has Congressman Mercer obtained recognition for the passage of the bill.  His first attempt was defeated by Kem of Nebraska.  Bailey of Texas prevented the bill's passage last night, but he was more reasonable than Kem, for today he quietly left the hall while Mr. Mercer called up the bill.</p>
                            <p>The bill as it was signed by the president makes no direct appropriation.  The friends of the measure have no doubt that the amount authorized to be expended by the bill will be included in the appropriation sheets of the next session of congress.</p>

                            <p>The news that the exposition bill had passed the house spread over the city like wildfire.  It was known on the streets within ten minutes after the vote was announced in the house of representatives.  Men shook one another by the hand and mutually congratulated themselves and everybody else.  Business men assumed a satisfied air and on every hand were heard expressions of joy and predictions of improvement in the near future.  flags were quickly displayed on public and private buildings and within a short time the city had put on a gala appearance, indicative of the joy felt by every citizen at the receipt of the long expected news.</p>
                            <p>At the Commercial club the board of governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben were at lunch and a mighty shout went up as the news was told to them.  The noise and those lunching in the adjoining room came running in to see what had occurred.  The telephone was kept hot by the joyous members in calling up their respective places of business and all their friends and telling the news.  Hearty expressions of approval were heard on every side from the members and the exposition formed the sole topic of conversation.  The board of governors sent the following telegram to Representative Mercer at once:</p>
                            <p>Hon. D. H. Mercer:  The Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben congratulate you on your successful fight for the exposition bill.  We are with you to a finish.  Hip!  Hip!  Hurrah!</p>

                            <p>The fire bell on the engine house at Eighteenth and Harney streets, which has been discontinued as a fire alarm, was rung for several minutes to announce the glad news.</p>
                            <p>The telephones in the newspaper offices were kept going all afternoon, answering questions regarding the bill and confirming the reports circulated on the streets.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles of the Transmississippi association returned home yesterday in time to hear the news and at once commenced making arrangements for having the event properly celebrated.  The other members of the directory of the association were at the fair grounds attending the races.</p>

                            <p>Speaking of the future plans of the officers of the Transmississippi Exposition company, Secretary Wakefield last night said:  "The news of the passage of the bill comes so suddenly that we hardly known just what to say.  While we expected that the bill would pass, the action of congress was something of a surprise.</p>
                            <p>"Within a day or two we will issue a call for a public meeting, when we will lay the proposition before the citizens of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>"The bill has now become a law and the next thing is to hold the exposition.  We have got to have $1,000,000 and with that amount of money, which Nebraska, Douglas county and Omaha must raise, we will have the greatest exposition that the people of the United States have ever seen, barring, of course, the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>"The whole matter is now in the hands of the public and everything must be done for the public good.  The citizens and others who are interested must agree upon some plan along which they would h<unclear reason="torn"/> officers work and in this way we can accomplish the desired ends.  In the first place, we must have subscription books and the citizens must subscribe liberally to the stock, raising in this way at least $250,000, thus enabling us to have money with which to begin active work.  This having been accomplished, we anticipate little trouble in securing the balance of the money that will be required.  This balance we will raise in the city, county and state by bonds and donations.</p>
                            <p>"Within the next few days exposition matter will take on new life and all of the members of the local directory and the vice presidents of the several states will begin pushing the work."</p>

                            <p>The effect of the passage of the transmississippi exposition bill has already been felt so far as stimulating business confidence is concerned.</p>
                            <p>Last summer John A. Creighton conceived the idea of constructing a three-story brick and stone building on the vacant lots at Fourteenth and Davenport streets, to be used as a future home for the Creighton Medical college.  Mr. Creighton excavated and built the foundation, after which he discontinued work.  At that time he <choice><sic>state</sic><corr>stated</corr></choice> that he would not lay another brick in Omaha until the tide turned.</p>
                            <p>Last night Mr. Creighton telegraphed his architect, telling him to come to Omaha at once to prepare plans for the Creighton Medical college, as he desired to begin work within thirty days and push the construction with all possible speed.  In speaking of the matter, Mr. Creighton said: "The future of Omaha is now assured and from this time henceforth, the city will grow.  It will take on new life and will rapidly develop into the metropolis of the west.</p>
                            <p>"The Creighton Medical college will be erected at once, and I hope to have a force of men at work within the next six weeks.  The building, when completed, will cost $45,000.  It will be of brick and stone, three-stories high and will be modern in every respect."</p>

He believed that the question of railroad rates was vitally important to the up-building of Omaha as a manufacturing center.  He hoped to soon see the Missouri river made the basing line for freight rates by all roads.  The long haul from Colorado to Chicago would thus be broken up.</p>
                            <p>Major Robert S. Wilcox told of the birth of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben on March 28, 1895, and of the work that body had since done toward bringing in trade to Omaha.  He, in company with other members of the board of governors, had recently taken a trip to other cities and witnessed their street celebrations.  They found none that excelled the "Feast of Mondamin."  Last year the knights expended $16,000, only $2,100 of which was spent outside of Omaha.  This year every cent would be spent within the borders of this city and the pageant would be even superior to that of last year.</p>
                            <p>Hon. William B. Sterling, general solicitor of the Elkhorn, was then introduced and made the most eloquent of address of the evening.  Always pleasing, his speech was at times brilliant, while the delivery was that of an orator.  He said that although he has been a citizen of Omaha less than a year he had come to regard the Commercial club at a potent factor in the progress of this city.  He expressed in lofty terms his admiration for loyalty and admitted his surprise at finding a form of disloyalty existing within the city.  He said that he had met many men and a few women who were prone to point out the weak points of the city to all their friends, "while they completely ignore its strong points, which are by no means in the minority."  He was in favor of preaching the gospel of loyalty to Omaha and to its best interests.  He had been a citizen of a neighboring state for ten years and there had found a truer support of this city's strong points than in the city itself.  He was confident in Omaha's future and predicted that it would be a brilliant one.  In conclusion he paid a beautiful tribute to the city and its pre-eminent location and declared that the faith of those who had stood by the city should ere long be rewarded.</p>

                            <p>Ex-Governor Robert W. Furnas spoke briefly on the state fair.  He told of the introduction of the question in the territorial legislature nearly a half century ago, and noted the steady improvement since that time.  He declared his satisfaction at the manner in which Omaha had received the state fair last year, and promised that this year's exposition would be better than ever.  He stated the fair grounds were unfortunately a little too far removed from the center of the city, but as transit was now measured by minutes and not by miles, and as increased power was promised for this year, he thought all would be well.  He said that the people would leave $500,000 here this fall.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MAKE NO MISTAKE.</head>
                            <p>There is one impression that Omaha will be the chief gainer by the Trans-Mississippi exposition, and another that the exposition is to be an Omaha affair.  These are two errors that must be eradicated.  Omaha is merely the point selected for the people of the nineteen states and five territories composing the trans-Mississippi region, and other states, as well as foreign nations, who will be invited to participate, to come together and display the evidences of their genius, enterprise and energy.  Here is what the first bulletin of the exposition company says about the selection of Omaha by the trans-Mississippi congress during its last session here, when the congress unanimously passed the resolution favoring this city:</p>
                            <p>In the discussions among the members the suggestion was made that as the east at Philadelphia in 1876, the central states at Chicago in 1893, the south at New Orleans and Atlanta had held expositions of their resources, wealth and development, by government aid and recognition, it was due to the twenty-four states and territories west of the Mississippi river to have a similar exposition, which should be second only in magnificence to the Columbian exposition at Chicago in 1893.</p>
                            <p>The next point was to decide upon the most central location, convenient alike to the people of the east, the west, the north and the south.  By reason of the vast system of its railway mileage extending to all parts of the continent, its salubrious and genial climate, and the well known enterprise of its people, Omaha was unanimously selected by the congress as the location for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>As the exposition is to be international, do not give it a local name.</p>
                            <p>Bear this point in mind and call it the "Trans-Mississippi exposition," as it is to be a display in which all of the states and territories, the United States government and foreign nations are to be active participants, in which each will have a vital interest, irrespective of any local feature.  Every local feature should be obliterated.  Council Bluffs, Des Moines, Sioux City, Burlington, Dubuque and other cities of Iowa; Minneapolis and St. Paul, Duluth, St. Louis, St. Joseph and Kansas City, Topeka and Leavenworth, New Orleans, Galveston, Houston and Dallas, Little Rock, Denver and Pueblo, Salt Lake City and Ogden, Cheyenne and Laramie, Deadwood, Fargo, Helena and Butte, Boise City, Portland, Tacoma and Seattle, San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles, Phoenix, Santa Fe, and every city, town, hamlet, farm, mine and ranch in the region west of the great river will have the same interest in the success of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>It is theirs as much as Omaha's.</p>
                            <p>To attach to it a local name will dwarf its scope and usefulness in the development of the region whose products, skill and civilization are to be concentrated at Omaha in a display whose beauty and splendor will be unrivaled by none except the World's fair at Chicago in 1893.</p>
                            <p>The benefits accruing to Omaha cannot be computed, because the greater benefits accruing directly to the trans-Mississippi states and territories, and indirectly to all of the states, will be so vast that large as the advantage to Omaha will be, that to the states and territories all around us will be incomparable.  In proportion it will do for the west, and for the whole country, what the Centennial did for the east, the cotton expositions at New Orleans and Atlanta for the south, the Mid-Winter fair for the Pacific coast, and the Columbia exposition for the world.</p>
                            <p>It means the rapid and steady development of half of the continent, and when these mighty forces are at work, Omaha, with the other cities of the favored region will feel the impetus in every vein and artery of their existence.</p>

                            <p>There is one man Omaha can never forget for his valuable friendship and assistance in the passage of the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill through the house of representatives.  This is Colonel David B. Henderson, the congressman from Dubuque.  Heading the Iowa delegation in the house of representatives he is next to Speaker Reed on the committee on rules, which makes him the leader of that body in shaping legislation.</p>
                            <p>All through the weary hours of the session he was the consistent friend of Omaha and the exposition.  He repeatedly placed himself on record, by word and act, in favor of the measure so beneficent in its purposes.  To him we owe a great deal.  When Mr. Mercer did not secure the unanimous consent on Friday, Colonel Henderson promptly brought forward the new rule to govern the house for the ensuing Saturday session, which did away with the necessity of unanimous consent, and paved the way for the bill's passage.  In consequence of this new rule of the house held in continuous Saturday session until Wednesday night.</p>

                            <p>In answer to an inquiry from Trenton, Neb., the various kinds of money are defined below.  Primary money is money which is not redeemable in any other kind of money.  This kind of money is also described as "standard money" and as "money of ultimate redemption."  "Token money" is generally understood to be metallic money of limited legal tender, which is redeemable in standard money.  "Fiat money" is paper money which is not a promise to pay any other kind of money.  "Credit money" is money&#8212;usually paper&#8212;which is redeemable in some other kinds of money.</p>

                            <p>Senator Hill's bill to regulate punishment for contempt passed the senate during the closing hours.  Before it passed the senate adopted the amendment suggested by the World-Herald insuring the right of trial by jury in all cases where the accused requests it.  As amended, the bill is all right, and it is to be regretted that it could not have passed the house also.  The final passage of the measure will prove that the people are still alive to public dangers and still competent to protect their rights.</p>
                        </div2>

                            <p>An Aurora, Neb., reader of the World-Herald asks if there ever was a bill introduced in congress providing for free and unlimited coinage at 16 to 1.  Yes.  It is safe to say that such a bill has been introduced in every congress which has assembled since 1876.  Such a measure has repeatedly passed the house or the senate, but has never passed both houses of congress during the same session.</p>
                            <p>By persistently ignoring the Trans-Mississippi exposition the Kansas City papers are displaying a lack of enterprise entirely out of keeping with the spirit of the west.  Kansas City will certainly be a beneficiary of this great industrial movement.  Her business men know it, but her newspapers are silent.</p>
                            <p>The Times-Herald says that people go to see Tillman for the same reason that they go to a museum.  According to the Times-Herald they regard his as a new and strange animal.  No, that is a mistake.  They are interested in seeing him knock out any goldbug who steps into the ring.</p>
                            <p>If Editor Young of the Des Moines Capital will come this way he will find out what Omaha thinks of him.  The Capital was one of the first newspapers in Iowa to favor the Trans-Mississippi exposition, and Mr. Young has always been one of its warmest friends.</p>
                            <p>The St. Joseph Gazette talks about the outlook in Cuba, but hasn't a word to say about some things nearer home&#8212;the Transmississippi exposition, for instance.  Where is Vice President Doniphan?</p>
                            <p>We need a Chicago board of trade excursion to Omaha more than ever.  Chicago business men will want to see the future Trans-Mississippi exposition city.  Which railroad will start the movement?</p>

                            <p>The Transmississippi exposition at Omaha in the year 1898 is at last definitely assured.  The bill granting congressional recognition to the enterprise and pledging $200,000 from the national treasury for a government building and exhibit has passed the crucial ordeal of legislative and executive assent and is now a law.  With national recognition granted and participation of the government guaranteed the great enterprise is safely launched.  The co-operation of the respective states and territories in the transmississippi country will follow as a natural sequence.  The advantages which this great exposition will afford for the development of the vast resources of the country directly concerned will be the strongest incentive for participation.  For the states contiguous to Nebraska, and especially for Omaha, the exposition will inaugurate a new era of development and prosperity.  The contest over the exposition bill in the house had engrossed public attention in this section as no other measure had before.  The mere announcement that the exposition bill had passed through both houses of congress and received the president's signature has created unbounded popular enthusiasm and a general revival of confidence.</p>
                            <p>The glory and credit of the final success should be accorded where it properly belongs.</p>
                            <p>The people of Omaha have reason to feel grateful and they will not be slow to appreciate the service rendered by their indefatigable representative in the house.  Congressman Mercer has made a gallant fight and in the last stages he was ably seconded by Senator Allen, who has from the outset given the exposition his earnest and active support.</p>

                                <l>(Council Bluffs Nonpareil.)</l>
                                <p>The Trans-Mississippi exposition being now an assured event, Council Bluffs should not only gird itself for a heroic effort to make it the great success which is contained within its possibilities, but should be equally prompt in putting itself in readiness for improving every opportunity to gain its share of the local benefits.  There are annually a large number of state <choice><sic>conventiones</sic><corr>conventions</corr></choice> and gatherings from even larger extents of territory, which can easily be induced to select Council Bluffs as their meeting place for 1898, provided this city is ready to invite their presence and provide for their stay.  The first and all-important move in this direction is the securing of an auditorium of sufficient size and convenience to meet the demands of the largest gatherings.  With such an auditorium and the putting forth of a very little effort and the proper presentation of the other advantages of this great railway center, together with the attractiveness of the exposition, would cause this city to be crowded with visitors during the entire season of 1898.</p>
                                <p>It seems that there should be no necessity of arguments and pleadings to arouse Council Bluffs to a realization of its opportunities, and yet it appears to be a difficult task to get the public to fully realize what the Trans-Mississippi exposition means for the west, and especially for that part of the west within the immediate vicinity of its location.  While the exposition will not reach the magnitude of the World's fair, yet it will approximate it much nearer than many think.  It will doubtless be a closer second to it than any other held in this country.  There will be several million dollars expended in the display, there will be hundreds of thousands of people drawn here from all parts of the world, and never again in the history of Omaha and Council Bluffs will there by such an opportunity of presenting and advancing the interests of both cities.</p>
                                <p>It seems some time in the future before the dream of the exposition will be realized, but when one thinks of what must be done 1898 seems as though tomorrow.  The time is short when measured by the needs of preparation, and Council Bluffs cannot afford to lose a day in beginning on its preliminary plans for improving this opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
                                <p>The first and most pressing demand of duty is for a prompt preparation for the erection of a great auditorium, and the immediate planning for securing the holding of conventions here.  It is a practical move, and the next to having the exposition itself located here, will result in causing this city to throb with activity such as has not been manifested since its founding.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>

                                <l>(Sioux City Journal.)</l>
                                <p>The national indorsement of the proposed Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held in Omaha in the summer of 1898 was certainly all that the projectors could have desired.  The bill went through the house by a unanimous vote, was sent through the senate in a few minutes and was promptly signed by the president.  It gives to the exposition national recognition, which is more valuable than the pledge of a government building and United States exhibit.  It makes certain the holding of the exposition.</p>
                                <p>The plans for the exposition contemplates a grand fair for which more than $1,000,000 will be expended, at which will be shown the products of the trans-Mississippi region, together with the interesting things which may be brought from all parts of the United States and other countries of the world.  If the exposition should be confined solely to what might illustrate the resources, industries and accomplishments of the region west of the Mississippi river it would be entirely possible to have a show that would be worth traveling far to see.  The trans-Mississippi river country is a big half of the United States.</p>
                                <p>It is said that the people of the south were disappointed in the results of the exposition at Atlanta last year.  It is probable that they were too eager for results and have but to wait and their expectations will be realized.  If the Trans-Mississippi exposition is held in Omaha two years hence great good ought to immediately follow for Omaha and gradually benefits will come to other parts of the trans-Mississippi region until the influence has been spread out all over the west.  If there is to be any lasting good for Omaha there must be good for all the towns and cities to the trans-Mississippi region and for the farms and factories and the mines and railroads and all sources of wealth.  The people of Omaha cannot reap the harvest alone nor can they reap it with one sweep of the scythe.</p>
                                <p>All the people of Nebraska and South Dakota and Iowa are interested in the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  If they give it encouragement and support it will be a success.  If they make of is a success they will be helping themselves.

                                <head type="sub">SIOUX CITY AND OMAHA.</head>
                                <l>(Sioux City Times.)</l>
                                <p>The bill appropriating $200,000 for the Omaha or Trans-Mississippi exposition passed both houses of congress yesterday and was signed by the president.  It was a great victory for the Omaha people, and especially for Congressman Mercer, who persisted in forcing the bill to the front and finally routed the obstructionists and got the appropriation which makes sure the holding of the exposition in Omaha.  Just how extensively this exposition will be, how elaborate the buildings, how comprehensive the exhibits, how complete all the arrangements for entertainment of the crowds, cannot now be known, but there will be a good exposition, which will attract thousands of visitors from all over the country.</p>
                                <p>Sioux City has an interest in this exposition, now that it is to be held.  Sioux City is about three hours' ride from Omaha&#8212;right at the gateway to one of the finest agricultural regions of the whole country.  Sioux City is one of the prominent Missouri river business points on the line which divides the rich valley country from what was once known as the Great American desert.  We know, and every resident of the region knows, that to the west of the Missouri river lies one of the finest farming regions of the world, but the fact is not accepted by the people of the far east.  Sioux City is interested, alike with Omaha, St. Joseph, Sioux Falls, Lincoln, Fargo, Council Bluffs and other cities, in having the truth about the whole trans-Mississippi region known of all men.  If the Omaha exposition helps any one, it will help all.</p>
                                <p>But there is something more in this for Sioux City, if it comes quickly to a realization of the situation.  There will be thousands of visitors at the Omaha exposition who have come long distances to see a fair in which are represented the resources of this grand region.  They will not all of them be satisfied to look through the buildings at Omaha and then to return home to say they had seen "the west."  The American people are thorough investigators.  They want to see it all.  Thousands of the people who go to Omaha may be induced to come to Sioux City on special trains with low rates.  They will come to Sioux City and go on to South Dakota and Northern Nebraska and Northwest Iowa.  They will invest here and there, or go home to tell about the wonderful opportunities for investment, and induce others to come this way.  That is what we all want&#8212;and we can get it if we try.</p>
                                <p>Now is the time for Sioux City to begin to prepare for these visitors.  Let us improve the city and make it look more attractive.  Let us have paved streets and well cared for homes.  Fill the business blocks and keep them filled with business houses.  Get all the factories possible, so that many people will have employment.  Make Sioux City a better stock and grain market.  Give encouragement to every legitimate enterprise and support them loyally&#8212;and finally all get together and prepare to entertain the overflow of the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>

                                <p>The Omaha exposition appropriation bill has passed both branches of congress and the people of Omaha are supremely happy.  The people of Des Moines and of Iowa generally will extend congratulations to the people of Omaha and Nebraska.  Now let the great exposition be pushed.</p>

                            <p>Omaha, June 12.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: Certain candidates for the republican nomination for congress in this district are making themselves ridiculous in their attempts to deprive Congressman Mercer of the credit he deserves for pulling the exposition bill successfully through the legislative and executive branches of the government.  Mr. Mercer's friends do not claim that he single-handed and alone accomplished this dexterous feat, but they give credit to Senators Allen and Thurston and Congressman Hafner, Strode, Andrews and Meiklejohn.  They are willing also to accord their thanks for the assistance of the entire Iowa delegation and the friends of the measure throughout the country.  This does not detract one leaf from the laurels of our own exceedingly enterprising and persistent representative.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer stood right at his post.  He never flinched for a moment.  In season and out of season, he worked for the bill.  When others were home fixing up political fences Mr. Mercer was on the ground, devoting himself to this paramount measure.  If he had been less vigilant, less popular or less skillful in any particular the exposition bill would never have reached the White house.</p>
                            <p>The candidates for his shoes say he had nothing to do with the success of the bill.  Oh, no!  He could not possibly have beaten it if he had tried.  He could have passed it long before had he so chosen.  Speaker Reed stood in with him.  Kem objected merely as a part of the plan.  Bailey stood up and raised a point of order to help on the grand stand play of the Omaha congressman.  Then the senate concurred immediately on motion of Senator Allen to assist in the pyrotechnics.  Finally, Grover Cleveland joined in the grand scheme for Mercer's advancement and signed the bill.  All this was prearranged to give Mr. Mercer a boom for re-election and disconcert the perspiring, aspiring citizens who wish to succeed him.</p>
                            <p>This is absurd on its face and unless the gentlemen referred to wish to be laughed out of the congressional race they will confine themselves to the anti-third term idea.</p>
                            <p>Gentlemen, do not be asinine.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ALL OF THE BUSINESS MEN ARE HOPEFUL</head>
                            <head type="sub">Passage of the Exposition Bill Leads Them to Believe that an Era of Prosperity is About to Set In.</head>
                            <p>The first emotion that prevailed in Omaha when the news of the passage of the exposition bill came over the wires was of unbounded gratification.  People were content to know that the first great obstacle had been surmounted and for some time they were too excited and enthusiastic to ask themselves exactly what was to follow.  They have now had time to digest their satisfaction and every one is looking around to see where the first tangible benefit is going to strike.</p>
                            <p>It may be safely said that ninety-nine men out of every 100 have figured out the problem.  The conservative business man does not expect that a boom will follow the act of congress, but he does believe that this is the wedge that will bring other results in their natural order.  It is not difficult for the average business man to see how he is going to reap the benefit of a movement that he believes will at least be prolific of confidence in the future of Omaha, not only on the part of the citizens, but of those who have their capital invested here.  There is a better tone noticeable in all kinds of business, born of the simple fact that men believe that Omaha has taken a step in the direction of renewed prosperity.  They realize that the hardest battle is yet to be fought and that when Omaha men are asked to go down into their pockets and raise the sum that must be furnished at home to carry on the exposition the real test of Omaha enterprise and loyalty will come.  But now that only the co-operation of local interests is necessary in order to make the fair a success they believe that that support will be forthcoming.</p>
                            <p>The business men who have handled the project during its incipiency have especial cause for gratification.  They have seen that which was not long ago regarded as visionary by a certain element take form and substance.  And the success that has been achieved so far leads them to believe more firmly than ever that the Transmississippi exposition of 1898 will be second only to the great fair at Chicago.</p>
                            <p>No definite plans have been made as yet by the Transmississippi Exposition association beyond those previously announced.  The next step will naturally be to prepare to raise the additional funds that will be required to go ahead with the work, and in this particular the <choice><sic>asociation</sic><corr>association</corr></choice> will ask the advice of the citizens and business men generally.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said yesterday morning that until a public meeting was held no further steps would be taken.  The meeting would in all probability be held next Monday night, and it was expected that there would be a full attendance of citizens.  They would be asked to suggest ways and means for raising the necessary funds.  The fair association would have its hands full with other matters, and the citizens of Omaha must step in and furnish the money.  After consulting the general sentiment of the city the next step would be too complete the organization of the various bureaus.  That accomplished the active work of preparing for the exposition would begin, and if the project received the liberal financial support that it deserved its success was assured.</p>

                            <p>Senator Allen has telegraphed that he will arrive in the city next Monday morning on his return home from Washington.  In view of this fact, members of the populist party have called a meeting for this evening, to be held in Knights of Labor hall, 110 South Fourteenth street, to perfect the plans for giving the senator a rousing reception.</p>
                            <p>At this time is it not known just what the senator's desires may be as to stopping over for a day prior to going to his home at Madison.  If he should decide that he must continue his journey to his home, the reception will be held later in the week, but if not, he will be the city's guest next Monday night.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Express the Opinion that New Buildings Will Now Be Erected.</head>
                            <p>One of the classes most vitally interested in the success of the exposition are the architects and builders.  Confidence in Omaha means that the building trade that has been almost at a standstill for the past two or three years will again become active.  No one anticipates that a building boom will suddenly start up on the strength of the passage of the exposition bill, but it is the general opinion of the leading architects of the city that the circumstance will be a potent factor in bringing about a gradual revival of building operations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Laurie of Fisher &amp; Laurie said yesterday that it was certainly a matter of much importance to the building interests.  "It does not pay to exaggerate," he continued.  "We have had too much of that already.  We are not going to wake up in the morning and see big new blocks that have risen up, mushroom like, in the night.  But I firmly believe that the passage of the exposition bill will do more to start the ball rolling than anything else that could be suggested.  Capitalists are not going to build blocks on the strength of it.  They are going to look the ground over, see what rentals they can be assured of and act accordingly.  But they will have renewed confidence and while the result will be gradual, it will be a healthy growth.  I do not think it would be wise to quote specific instances of buildings that are likely to be brought about by reason of the exposition.  But I do know that it will have a material effect on men who are contemplating the erection of buildings, and in fact I know that it is responsible to a considerable extent for the idea of a $100,000 block on Douglas street that is now under consideration."</p>
                            <p>C. E. Beindorff was even more sanguine.  He was enthusiastic over the bill, and declared that it would have an immediate effect on the building interests.  In fact, he knew that the news had already almost assured the erection of at least two structures.  In one case the improvement was now practically assured and the plans would be drawn at once.</p>
                            <p>Charles Cleves of Cleves Bros. said that while he had not seen any of his customers since the bill passed, he was assured that it would have a good effect.  It would inspire confidence in men who had money to invest and have a tendency to start them out of the rut.  The results might not be immediate, but a material step had been taken toward bringing them about.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kimball of Walker &amp; Kimball thought the bill meant everything to Omaha.  The city was bound to grow.  It had the location and the people and would eventually become the great city of the west.  The exposition would do much to hasten the result and the immediate effect of the passage of the bill would certainly be to revive confidence and eventually bring about a satisfactory activity in building circles.</p>

                            <head type="sub">They Look Forward to a Season of Great Prosperity.</head>
                            <p>Among real estate men there was great rejoicing over the passage of the bill.  They have had a hard row to hoe for the past two years and they look forward to the exposition as an almost priceless boon.  With the contemplated improvements to the streets and the proposed extensions and improvements of the local railway service and the certain erection of a number of large and handsome buildings, the real estate dealers feel that the day they have longed for has come at last.</p>
                            <p>C. C. George, vice president of the Real Estate exchange, said:  "It will be several months before the contracts for the many new buildings that are already being talked of are let.  It will also take some time to find out just what improvements to the street car facilities and other local institutions will be made.  Therefore it will be some time before any decided effect is felt in the real estate world.  But already we can feel that there is renewed confidence in Omaha and its future among all the people.  Confidence is what we most need today, and I believe the passage of the exposition bill thoroughly establishes that confidence.  We have no new buildings in prospect ourselves, but I understand there are several large ones proposed, work on which will be begun in a short time."</p>
                            <p>C. A. Starr said:  "The great benefit the real estate men feel from the passage of the bill is a general stiffening of the market.  There is no sudden land boom, but there is a feeling that the future of the city is secure and that real estate in this city <unclear reason="cut off"/></p>

                            <p>Council Bluffs will ratify the passage of the great exposition bill this evening and will do it in such a generous and hearty manner that the noise will be heard all over the country.  Just as many Omaha people as care to can come over and see how it will be done, and there will be no objection to any or all of them taking part in it.  The final arrangements for the demonstration were completed last evening at the adjourned meeting held in the office of ex-Mayor Cleaver.</p>
                            <p>The meeting called for the previous evening had been adjourned to meet again at 5 o'clock, and before that hour had arrived the room was filled with citizens representing the various business interests of the city.  Hon. George F. Wright, vice president for Iowa of the Exposition association, called the meeting to order and was made chairman by the unanimous vote of those present.  Nearly every military and civic association in the city had representatives present authorized to speak for their associations.  The two local bands, Dalbey's splendid organization and the new Odd Fellows' band, tendered their services for either afternoon or evening or both.  The Dodge Light Guards and the High School cadets had representatives present, each guaranteeing to bring out a company of forty men.  The general character the demonstration should take was discussed at length and it was decided that the leading features should be a parade traversing the principal business streets and ending at Bayliss park and the corner of Pearl street and First avenue opposite the Grand hotel.  Fireworks and band and martial music will be features of the parade.  The program to be carried out at the park will consist of music, military drills, with platoon firing and short speeches from a platform to be erected on the northeast corner of the park.  After it was decided what should be done the meeting lost no time in getting down to practical work.  Committees were appointed to take charge of every feature of the demonstration.  Victor Bender, E. F. Clark and Dr. J. H. Cleaver were appointed as the committee on program.  Colonel D. B. Dailey was appointed marshal with power to chose his own aides.  M. F. Rohrer, E. A. Troutman and A. S. Hazelton were appointed a committee on speakers and instructed to go to Omaha and invite some of the best orators there to come over and make short addresses in connection with well known local speakers.  A committee, consisting of Walter Woodward, Dea Patton and Alderman L. M. Shubert, was appointed to provide stands for the speakers and music.  I. M. Treynor and Prof. J. H. Simms were made a committee on vocal music and ordered to provide a quartet from the best local talent.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ALL THE NOISE POSSIBLE.</head>
                            <p>The question of the best means of making the most noise was discussed, and it was decided that as much noise as possible must be made and that a big display of fireworks was necessary.  A committee consisting of George S. Wright, W. H. Lynchard and Henry De Long, was instructed to collect money and purchase plenty of fireworks and provide ammunition for the military firing.  Mayor Carson was asked for an expression of opinion concerning the feasibility of requesting the merchants to close their places of business after 8 o'clock.  He could see no harm in making the request, and thought that if it was generally known the people would do all of their Saturday evening trading before that time or wait until after the demonstration was over when the stores could be opened again.  The stores generally close at 6 o'clock every evening except Saturdays and Mondays.  A resolution was passed asking the mayor to issue a proclamation, requesting all business houses to close and inviting the public of Council Bluffs and Omaha generally to participate in the ratification.</p>
                            <p>If the committees work as rapidly as did the power that created them there will be nothing lacking to make the ratification a big affair.  A resolution was passed asking all of the committees to meet at 8 o'clock for the purpose of completing the program and arranging the work to be done.</p>

                            <p>All of Colonel Dailey's aides and others taking part in the parade will meet at the Grand hotel corner at 7:30.  Every wheelman and wheelwoman in the city is invited to join in the parade.  Chinese lanterns will be provided for all who will apply at the Ganymede club rooms.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Carson issued his proclamation last evening requesting all business houses to close their doors during the early part of the evening, for the purpose of permitting their employes to take part in the demonstration.</p>
                            <p>Another request has been made, which, it is hoped, will be generally observed, and that is for the manipulator of every steam whistle in the city to blow it long and loud promptly at 8 o'clock.  A request has been made of the sextons of all the churches in the city to ring the bells at that hour.  This noise, added, to the booming of cannon firecrackers, shotguns and anvils, will make a noise that will be heard in Nebraska, and let the world know that Council Bluffs is rejoicing over the glad tidings from Washington.</p>
                            <p>Hon. George F. Wright was detailed last evening as a special committee of one to wait upon Hon. H. D. Estabrook, now in Omaha, and induce him to come over and make a speech.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">THE WORK BEFORE US.</hi></head>
                            <p>With the assurance of a great exposition for 1898 many questions vital to the success of that vast empire present themselves for solution.  First and foremost comes the raising of funds.  A moderate estimate of the total outlay involved is $2,000,000.  That estimate includes the laying out of the grounds, construction of buildings and expenses incidental thereto.  It does not include the necessary improvement of roadways leading to the exposition, the repaving of streets and other works of public improvement that must be made by the city and county preparatory to the entertainment of hundreds of thousands of strangers.</p>
                            <p>Provision must be made at the very outset for the widest publicity of the exposition both in this country and abroad.  Landscape and building plans must be procured as soon as the site has been decided upon.  An organized effort must be made to secure the hearty co-operation of state and municipal officers and commercial bodies in the transmississippi states, and that must be followed up by missionary work among the various legislatures in order to assure liberal appropriations for state buildings and exhibits.</p>
                            <p>Under the conditions of the transmississippi bill, at least $250,000 must be raised by stock subscription or donation before the $200,000 pledged by congress for the government exhibit shall become available.  It will therefore devolve upon the managers of the Exposition association to enlarge their subscription list to at least $250,000.  This ought not to be a difficult task in view of the fact that the company will be in position to pay back the greater part, if not all, of the amounts subscribed.  At Atlanta the stockholders got back over 90 per cent of their payments, and in San Francisco they received every dollar and a small dividend in addition.  The gate receipts, privileges and salvage ought to pay not only the outlay for publicity, supervision, policing, clerical service, manual labor, light, power and water, but also for such buildings as the association must erect independent of city or state or federal government.  The authorized capital stock of the Exposition association is $1,000,000, and while only a quarter of that sum must be had as a condition precedent, the full amount of stock authorized should be subscribed for within ninety days.  The larger the aggregate subscription the smaller will be the assessments and the less burdensome upon the individual subscriber.  It was really the height of sublime assurance on the part of the promoters of the exposition to ask congressional aid before they had themselves raised any considerable amount of money as a guaranty of substantial backing and good faith.  This was in truth one of the greatest drawbacks in the way of the men who had undertaken to get the bill through the two houses of congress at this session.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 13.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;President Cleveland, in an interview had with Congressman Mercer today, said as to the Transmississippi and International exposition:  "Since the Chicago Exposition, I have been opposed to these expositions, but I believe the Omaha Exposition will be of great service to that great section of country lying west of the Mississippi river.  That section has suffered greatly through drouth and the tide of emigration has been toward the south, rather than to the west.  It will have a tendency to revive interest, not only in agriculture, but in mines as well, and I signed the bill, believing it would be of vast benefit to a wonderful section of our country."</p>
                            <p>To The Bee correspondent, who saw the president immediately after his reception this afternoon, and who asked him for an expression on the exposition, Mr. Cleveland said:  "It seems to me that the signature of the bill is expression enough at this time, as to my interest in the exposition.  When you need a stronger expression, then I shall be pleased to say something for the benefit of the great west."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer today received from Private Secretary Thurber the pen with which the president signed the exposition bill.  It is an old steel stub pen, with a wooden holder, cork tipped.  With the pen is the following certificate:</p>
                            <p>EXECUTIVE MANSION, June 13, 1896.&#8212;I hereby certify that the pen and pen-holder hereto attached is the identical one used by the president of the United States in signing the Transmississippi and International exposition act.</p>
                            <ab>HENRY T. THURBER, <lb/> Private Secretary.</ab>
                            <p>With this certificate there will also be greetings from the president, vice president and speaker of the house.  Mr. Mercer will carry this precious souvenir of a bitter fight to Omaha next week.</p>
                            <p>President Cleveland failed to sign Representative Hainer's joint resolution, as to the extension of time to the settlers on Indian lands, in which to pay their obligations to the Indians, Secretary Hoke Smith being unalterably opposed to the measure.  Secretary Thurber stated today that this matter had been covered in Indian appropriations bills, but in modified form.</p>

                            <p>This program has therefore been arranged:  The members of the Allen club and the Douglas County Populist club will meet Senator Allen when the Northwestern train arrives tomorrow morning and an informal reception will be held at the depot until his departure on the Union Pacific train, about an hour later.  Arrangements will then be made for Senator Allen to return to Omaha some time next week.  The Commercial club will entertain him one evening and on the next evening he will speak at one of the theaters.</p>

                            <p>D. Clem Deaver received a letter yesterday evening from Senator W. V. Allen, in which the senator gives strong reasons for his desire to go on home before coming to Omaha for the reception that was being prepared for him.  The members of the populist committee and the Commercial club members have accepted the senator's suggestion and will arrange for the entertainment of their guest at a date to be fixed Monday.  On account of the short time allowed the Commercial club members considered they would not have time to arrange the kind of an entertainment due the senator, and were well pleased with the suggestion for a later date.</p>
                            <p>The program mapped out now is as follows:  The senator will arrive in Omaha Monday morning, coming over the Northwestern, at 8:10, and will be met at the depot by the populist committee and others who wish to meet him.  He will then take the train at 9:30 for his home at Madison, after having agreed upon a date for his return to Omaha.  At that time he will remain here two days.  The <choice><sic>firist</sic><corr>first</corr></choice> evening he will be the guest of the Commercial club and the citizens of Omaha generally, regardless of party, that evening being devoted to a reception of the senator, politics not being considered.  The next evening he will be the guest of the people's party, and will deliver an address in one of the opera houses.</p>

                            <p>It is worthy of observation that these republican newspapers that do not forget to roast Kem for his "objections" do forget to give credit to Senator Allen.  It don't pay to be small, boys.  Better broaden out.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Press Hails the Transmississippi Law with Delight.</head>
                            <p>Beaver City Tribune (rep.): Congressman Mercer is the biggest man in Nebraska since he secured the passage of the Omaha exposition bill.</p>
                            <p>Kearney Hub (rep.):  The press of San Francisco gives a strong endorsement of the Transmississippi exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898.  Indeed, the entire west and middle west is enthusiastic for it.</p>
                            <p>Schuyler Herald (dem.):  The citizens of Omaha are sounding the praises of Senator Allen for the substantial aid he gave in securing the appropriation for the exposition at Omaha.  There are some things for which we admire the senator and this is one of them.</p>
                            <p>Sidney Poinard (rep.):  In spite of all opposition the Omaha exposition bill passed the house Wednesday, the senate immediately concurred in the house amendment and the bill sent to the president, whose signature made it a law.  Omaha and all Nebraska rejoice.</p>
                            <p>Hartington Herald (rep.):  Score one for Nebraska.  The Transmississippi exposition bill became a law Wednesday.  It was passed through both houses and carried by Mr. Mercer to the president, where it received his signature, all in a little more time than it takes to write this account of it.</p>
                            <p>Howells Journal (rep.):  Nebraska greatly needs the Transmississippi exposition.  Needs it to show here wonderful resources; needs it to show what great possibilities she has; needs it to show her boundless productions and still greater capabilities.  It will be held with a certainty and the visitors there will be greatly surprised at what we have to exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Blair Courier (dem.):  Nebraska has escaped with but the fag end of a cyclone thus far, while surrounding states have felt its awful breath.  With plenty of rain and no cyclones we lift our hat and say:  Nebraska, home of our boyhood and manhood, too, we love thee dearly and ask no more than to live beneath thy skies for many years and to have the Transmississippi exposition in Omaha two years hence.</p>
                            <p>Springfield Monitor (rep.):  Congressman Mercer has added another feather to his cap and is to be congratulated on his untiring efforts and the many obstacles he overcame in getting the Omaha bill for the Transmississippi exposition through congress.  Senator Allen also did noble work for the bill.  The bill passed both houses yesterday without a hitch, and soon after its passage was signed by the president.  Every citizen of Omaha is accordingly happy.</p>
                            <p>Kearney Hub (rep.):  Omaha and the west are to be congratulated on the passage of the Transmississippi exposition bill, which was passed under great difficulties in the closing hours of the session after it had apparently been lost.  Congressman Mercer of Omaha is also entitled to the warmest of congratulations, and Senator Allen is to be commended for the assistance that he gave while his "pop" compatriot, Kem, was endeavoring to kill it.</p>
                            <p>Winside Tribune (rep.):  The Transmississippi exposition is almost an assured fact.  Omaha in particular and Nebraska in general should get down to a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together for the success of the enterprise.  It will again give us credit in the eyes of the world at large; it will show that Nebraska is one of the great producing states of the northwest; it will show that Nebraskans have the pluck, push and power to make a success of what they undertake.</p>
                            <p>Tekamah Herald (rep.):  The Transmississippi exposition bill has passed congress and now the great exposition is an assured fact for Omaha.  The government appropriates $200,000 at the outset, which will give the project the backing necessary to make it a success.  All Nebraska should rejoice, as the exposition will mark an era of greater prosperity for the state than has ever yet been witnessed.  It will bring people from all over the world to view for themselves our broad and fertile prairies.  They will depart having better ideas of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Grand Island Independent (rep.):  The passage of the Transmississippi and International exposition bill will be hailed with delight by the entire west, as it is the entire west that will be benefited by the exposition.  The transmississippi country abounds in resources of every description.  The manufactures along the eastern borders of the transmississippi country, the products of its fertile plains, the rich minerals of the mountain regions&#8212;none have had the advantage of such a display as the exposition will offer them.  It will, 
                            
                            <pb n="170" xml:id="TMISB01-170"/>
                            
                            furthermore, bring thousands of people to this western country who have but a vague idea of its value, and an erroneous impression of the people that inhabit it.  The whole west will rejoice over the passage of this bill.</p>
                            <p>Emerson Enterprise (rep.):  The people of Nebraska are taking great interest in the Transmississippi exposition which will be held in Omaha in 1898.  Congress has already appropriated $200,000, most of the states in the Mississippi and Missouri valleys will have state exhibits, and the exposition will be to this section of the country what the Atlanta fair was to the south.  It will be a grand thing for Nebraska.  The resources of the state will be properly shown up and the throngs of visitors who attend the exposition will see that the state is all right.</p>
                            <p>Gretna Reporter (rep.):  Hurrah for Nebraska, Omaha, Dave Mercer and the Transmississippi exposition!!!  By dint of the perseverance of Congressman Mercer and Senator Allen the exposition bill was passed Wednesday at noon by the house in spite of the opposition of Objector Kem and Congressman Bailey of Texas.  It was immediately transferred to the senate, where Senator Allen had the upper house consider and pass it almost immediately and the president's signature was attached yesterday, thus making the big exposition an assured fact.  No enterprise yet conceived is fraught with so much interest to every Nebraskan as this exposition, for it means that Nebraska will forge ahead of her sister states and be the center of attraction for two years to come.  Millions of dollars will be spent in the erection of buildings and exhibits by the exhibitors and by the millions of people who will visit the west at that time.  Now let every man put his shoulder to the wheel and talk this enterprise of enterprises along.</p>
                            <p>Papillion Times:  The proposed Transmississippi exposition at Omaha in 1898 is now an assured fact, the bill having been adopted yesterday by both houses of congress.  It only remained for President Cleveland to make the bill law by attaching his signature, and this he did immediately.  We congratulate Omaha and Nebraska upon securing such a splendid opportunity to prove to the outside millions who will visit us in 1898 that our state is all and more of an agricultural paradise than we have claimed for it.  The holding of the exposition at Omaha means the drawing to that city of millions of people from other states.  It means that during the exposition vast millions of outside money will be spent in Omaha, and in milder measure throughout the state.  Aside from favorably advertising Omaha and Nebraska and making rich all Omaha merchants and manufacturers, we do not believe the exposition will be of much value to the public.  But from a selfish standpoint we can be thankful for these favors and say welcome to the promised show, at the same time admonishing our Omaha friends that they do not want to go to sleep in the matter of raising the princely bonus promised in aid of the enterprise.  And indeed we do not believe Omaha should be called upon to raise this bonus unaided.  All Nebraska will profit by the exposition, and all Nebraska should help Omaha put up the purchase price of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Fremont Tribune:  The Transmississippi exposition bill passed Wednesday in the dying hours of congress, after being held up by the throat at a critical stage of its passage by Congressman Kem, who emerged long enough from the gloom of obscurity which has encircled him since the day he took his seat, to seriously menace the best interests of his state.</p>
                            <p>This measure is one in which twenty-seven western states are interested, and of vast importance to Omaha and the whole state of Nebraska.  It insures a great industrial exposition, such as has never been held anywhere in the west.</p>
                            <p>The advantages which will flow from it can scarcely be estimated.  It will focus attention to Omaha and Nebraska not only during the six months the exposition is open, but during the two years of the preliminary preparations.</p>
                            <p>It will produce a generous rivalry along all lines of productive activity.</p>
                            <p>It will increase values first in Omaha, then gradually and incidentally in Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>It will interest investors in this state.</p>
                            <p>And all these will promote emigration to Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Every loyal citizen of this state has abundant reason to congratulate himself over the successful issue of the exposition bill in congress.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MEN OF NEBRASKA.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There are two "men of Nebraska" in whom the people of this state have been most deeply interested during the last ten days, because these men have manifested a deep interest in Nebraska.  These are Senator William V. Allen and Congressman David H. Mercer.</p>
                            <p>The one is a populist, the other a republican; but the almighty concern of Nebraskans in the great exposition of 1898 has served for the time being to break down the barriers of political prejudice in order that these men may without challenge meet their constituents upon the ground of genuine appreciation and generous recognition.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps it has already occurred to some of the business men of Omaha, who in 1893 protested so vigorously against Allen's election as senator, that this is a mighty good time to rejoice that their valiant efforts were without success.  Then these business men wanted "an Omaha man," but now they have probably concluded that Senator Allen is a pretty good "Omaha man" himself.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The fact is that Senator Allen's good work on the exposition bill is a revelation only to those who were not acquainted with the man.  He is uncompromising in his political opinions, but there is no room within his generous makeup for the existence of narrow prejudice.  He appreciates the importance of commercial progress as well as he appreciates the necessity of prosperity among the masses.  He has the same pride in Omaha that he has in the great commonwealth of which Omaha is the metropolis.</p>
                            <p>It is somewhat curious, too, that Senator Allen's strong points came to be appreciated in Washington long before those good points were recognized by the business men of Omaha.  In part this is due to the habit some republican newspapers have of withholding credit from every man who is not a republican and heaping abuse upon every man who dares to be a populist.</p>
                            <p>When, in defense of a great principle to which he was conscientiously committed, Senator Allen held the senate floor in a fourteen-hour speech, certain republican newspapers in Nebraska attempted to make light of his effort and dubbed him "Windy V. Allen."  When on Tuesday an effort was made to adjourn the senate without action on the exposition bill, Senator Allen obtained the floor and intimated his readiness to deliver a seven-hour speech unless the bill was passed.  The bill was promptly passed and among all the references made since then in Omaha to the distinguished senator from Nebraska, the euphonious designation of "Windy V." has been conspicuous by its absence.  The people of this city were unanimous in rejoicing in those <choice><sic>charcteristics</sic><corr>characteristics</corr></choice> which have endeared Senator Allen to populists and to democrats.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>For many years the United States senate was known as the "millionaire club."  Its membership largely comprised men with more money than brains, and when Kansas dropped the long bearded Peffer into that mighty accumulation of boodle and goose grease it was the signal for sport.  It is out of all decent proportions and such a beard could not grow on the face of a man who did not have a wheel in perpetual motion in his cranium.  In addition to this Peffer is not an extremely lovable man.  The late William A. McKeighan was the only man who had the nerve to advise Peffer to part with his beard and he gave the advice very bluntly, too.  McKeighan suggested that Peffer ought to hire a barber and the Kansas senator curtly replied that his personal appearance was no concern of the public.  "Probably not," replied McKeighan, "but you have no right to interfere with the progress of a good cause by tangling it up in a mass of hair that would be all right on a woman's head, but is in mighty poor taste on a man's face."</p>
                            <p>When Nebraska elected a populist to the senate all arrangements were made to make sport of him.  But when the new senator from Nebraska took his seat it was very evident that there was nothing there to make sport of.  It's pretty hard to poke fun at a great big man whose very appearance gives indications of a combination of heart and brain.  In the contests on the floor Senator Allen long ago demonstrated that he is the match for any of his colleagues.</p>
                            <p>He has compelled the respect of his opponents by his ability and his determination, and he has won many warm personal friends among republican and democratic senators because of his agreeable personal characteristics.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>In childhood William V. Allen was required to assume the responsibilities of a man.  He was the son of a clergyman.  His father died while the lad was very young. and the young man's personal encounters with poverty heightened his sympathy for those in distress.</p>
                            <p>At the age of 15 years he was mustered in company G of the Thirty-second Iowa at Dubuque.  Captain S. P. Adams was the mustering officer.  Young Allen stood at the end of a long line.  In stature he was below regulation.  It was characteristic of him that in order to pass muster he scraped up a little mound of sand by which to increase his height and mounted it.  Captain Adams glanced at the lad and then at the mound of sand.  Then gazing admirably at the young recruit the captain said: "You will do, my boy.  What you lack in stature you make up in sand."</p>
                            <p>Today in his mature manhood Senator Allen is lacking neither in stature nor in sand.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Some of the people of Madison, Neb., Senator Allen's home, can relate many interesting stories which are characteristic of Nebraska's senior senator.  They will tell you how he organized the Madison Social club, in which the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker, with their wives, their sisters and their aunts, met on a common level for social pastime.  They will tell you how on one occasion an old negro died in Madison after being supported for many months at Senator Allen's expense.  Allen had promised him a Christian burial.  He kept his promise, called out a crowd of business men to attend the funeral and was himself the master of ceremonies.  They will tell you how on one occasion in Allen's less prosperous days the residence of one of his neighbors was destroyed by fire.  Allen circulated a subscription paper and headed the list with his own name for $150.  In order to subscribe that amount he borrowed $150 on his own good note and paid interest upon it.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Senator Allen has a weakness for fine poultry.  One day he purchased twenty-five fine chickens.  That night he was invited to attend a gathering at a neighbor's house and was asked to make a speech, presenting a chair to the host.  In his remarks Senator Allen took occasion to suggest to those present who lived in other portions of the town that they ought to move up in his neighborhood.  "Here," said Allen, "we all dwell in unity.  It is the most peaceable neighborhood in town, and in this vicinity moth and rust cannot corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal."  The next morning Senator Allen went to his hen house and found that while he was making that speech some corruptionist had broken through and stolen all his prize poultry.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There is one little story that illustrates better than anything else could the characteristics of Nebraska's senior senator.  A little cur dog was one day chased by the town marshal through the steers of Madison.  Senator Allison stood on the street corner and when the dog reached that corner the little animal took refuge between the senator's feet, crouching down there as if it felt secure.  The marshal rushed up and was about to seize the dog when Senator Allen asked him what he proposed to do.  "Going to kill the dog," said the marshal.  "What for?" asked Allen.  "What's the charge?"  "For the license money, of course," replied the marshal.  Senator Allen reached down and took the little cur up in his arms and turning to the marshal asked, "How much is this dog's life worth?"  "Three dollars," said the marshal.  "It's a cheap life at that," said Senator Allen as he paid the money.</p>
                            <p>This might seem to some to be a trifling incident, but it was a very important incident to that little cur and it is interesting because it serves to illustrate the fact that the man who battles with such rugged determination in the United States senate for the interests of the people has a heart that beats in sympathy for the unfortunate under all circumstances.</p>

                            <p>"Dave" Mercer takes to politics as a duck does to water, and he has a remarkable political history.  When he was a student at the State university he held every office within the gift of the students.  He finally became a candidate for editor-in-chief of the college paper, and his candidacy precipitated a contest that lasted for six months.  The fight became so bitter that the faculty became involved and the solemn professors themselves lined up for and against Mercer.  Mercer's first political office was that of city clerk of Brownville, Neb., to which position he was elected by a unanimous vote.  After his admission to the bar he served as police judge and justice of the peace at Brownville.  In 1884 he was elected secretary of the republican state central committee.  He wisely declined to accept a nomination to be mayor of Brownville and located in Omaha.  Here he went right to the front in local politics.  Within sixty days after locating in this city <unclear reason="cut off"/></p>
                            
                            <pb n="172" xml:id="TMISB01-172"/>
                            
                            <p>In 1887 Mercer was the republican nominee for county judge of Douglas county.  He was bitterly opposed by some of those who are today his warmest friends and was defeated by George Shields.</p>
                            <p>In 1891 Mercer became chairman of the republican county committee and very adroitly managed the campaign of that year.</p>
                            <p>When Brad Slaughter became United States marshal he made Mr. Mercer his chief deputy and twelve months or more were spent by the present congressman in serving the writs issued by the federal court.  It was about this time that Ben S. Baker, then United States attorney, had occasion to appoint an assistant.  Mr. Mercer was an applicant for that place and it was announced in the newspapers that Mercer's appointment had been decided upon.  In fact, Mr. Baker nominated Mr. Mercer and sent his name to Washington, but his name was rejected, and Howard H. Baldridge was appointed.  Mr. Mercer then became special master in chancery of the federal court.  While occupying this position he was nominated for congress.  His nomination was made over the protest of the republican organ and that of a great many republicans who are now his ardent champions.  The republican organ opposed him in the election, but he was successful by 1,100 majority over Judge Doane.  In 1894 he was renominated by acclamation and was re-elected by a handsome majority.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Mercer had two very great disappointments, his failure to be elected county judge and the rejection of his name for assistant United States attorney.  But in the light of subsequent events he congratulated himself upon both of these disappointments.  Had he been successful in either the probability is that he would never have held a seat in congress.</p>
                            <p>Senator Paddock once said:  "A member of congress is the mere errand boy for his constituents."  It must be conceded that Mr. Mercer has made a very good "errand boy."  He has been active and persistent in all matters, small and great, of individual or of public concern, and has confined himself to looking after the interests of his own district without worrying about the affairs of the general public.  Mercer has made a specialty of department work, and in this line he has been very successful.  The departments at Washington move slowly and by a routine in vogue since the days of our forefathers red tape by the mile is always upon the official counter and doled out whether one likes it or not.  A cordon of porters and doorkeepers line every corridor and official politeness is long drawn out.</p>
                            <p>When Mr. Mercer first struck Washington he created a sensation among the doorkeepers and clerks at these departments.  He came in like a St. Louis cyclone, brushed past watchful doorkeepers, trampled down the formalities surrounding chiefs of bureaus and drew men to him in Washington exactly as he had done in Nebraska.  Mercer had not been in Washington sixty days before he had a personal acquaintance with the chief of every bureau and every department clerk with whom Nebraskans had business.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>It is said that Mercer is the only man who ever thawed the ice in the vicinity of Bowler, comptroller of the treasury.  Bowler is the man who held up the sugar bounty money and has no words nor time to waste.  Mercer went into Bowler's presence one day and committed the awful offense of approaching him without card and without introduction.  Bowler was engaged at the time with a caller.  Mercer dropped into a chair.  When the visitor departed Bowler suddenly wheeled in his chair and giving the Omaha congressman an icy stare, abruptly demanded: "Well, what do you want?"  Approaching the throne, Mercer replied, "I want the right to be treated respectfully, for you are no more than I, a public servant, and you are paid to be civil."</p>
                            <p>"Well, I like your style," said Bowler.</p>
                            <p>"I could improve on yours," said Mercer, "and if you'll warm up a little we'll get better acquainted and perhaps to the advantage of both of us."</p>
                            <p>Bowler held out his hand, the ice thawed and the two men subsequently became friends.</p>

                            <p>An analysis of character is frequently made easy by comparison, but with Mercer the task becomes more difficult from the fact that there is no political celebrity in Nebraska with whom a comparison can be fairly made.  Mercer received his first lessons in political management in Nemaha county, the home of those celebrated granger statesman, Church Howe and Thomas J. Majors, but the pupil has outstripped his masters and today both Howe and Majors might sit with profit at the feet of their erstwhile young disciple and discover resources hitherto hidden from their sight.  Mercer has all of Howe's urbanity, and all of Majors' unconventionality.  He is urbane, not entirely from policy, but largely because he can't help it.  And he is unconventional without boorishness, because his heart is well developed.</p>
                            <p>Mercer is the same man under all circumstances.  As a newspaper reporter the writer has come in contact with Mercer in all of his various positions from delegate to a city convention to a representative in the lower house of congress, and barring the fact that he is today in more prosperous circumstances there is no difference in the Mercer who greets you under the dome of the capitol and the Mercer who went out of his way as a delegate in the city convention from the Seventh ward to accommodate the newspaper reporters with accurate and interesting information.  The cheerfulness with which he complies with his constituents' requests is not assumed.  To be accommodating is one of Mercer's fixed habits, and he has been thoroughly consistent in his kindness.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer has a fight on his hands for renomination.  Two objections are urged against him by his opponents.  One relates to the third term and the other involves Mercer's republicanism.  It seems strange to suggest that Mercer's republicanism could possibly be involved, and yet that is the most important line upon which his renomination will be opposed.</p>
                            <p>Since the first part Mercer played in politics he has been a doubly distilled republican.  He has used his complete knowledge of the science of practical politics to drag his party's nominees out of many a tight place.  His first nomination for congress was opposed on the claim that he was nothing more or less than a party man&#8212;a shrewd, practical politician of great service in political war, but not one to be pushed to the front in times of peace.  Republicans who were too good for their party refused to support him in 1892, but their places were supplied at the polls be men of other parties, who wanted to "give the boys a chance."</p>
                            <p>His election to congress may be said to have been intended as a reward for faithful party service, and yet today the objection to his renomination involves his republicanism.</p>
                            <p>It was during the last local election in Douglas county.  The newspaper which had refused to support the republican nominee for governor the preceding year had built up a little "holier than thou" political organization, the pretended purpose of which was to put good men in office, the real purpose being to destroy the republican organization.  This same element had also opposed Mercer in his first contest for congress.  On one side was lined up the men who had, with Mercer, labored faithfully for the g. o. p. and who had elected Mercer to congress; on the other side were the elements that had endeavored to destroy the g. o. p. and that had refused to support Mercer for congress even after he was nominated.  Mercer's present opponents allege that he did not give the republican ticket the proper support and that his sympathies were really with the other side.  There is no doubt but that the majority of republicans are favorable to Mercer's renomination.  But everyone who is opposed to him will go to the polls, while many who favor him will be inclined to neglect their duty.  This is true because in politics antagonism is a greater incentive than gratitude.  The support of one "Van Alstine" at republican primaries is more valuable than the support of two business men.  This is not because the "Van Alstine" influence is great, but because the "Van Alstine" puts all of it in operation, while the average business man will hardly take the trouble to vote at the primary.</p>
                            <p>It will be strange if on the day of the republican primaries many business men who are now enthusiastically declaring for Mercer do not neglect their duty to vote on the usual plea "there'll be plenty without me."  Judged from the standpoint of practical politics there will not be a Mercer vote to spare at the republican primaries.  If all who favor Mercer attend he will be nominated by a big majority, but all will not attend unless every Mercer man resolves himself into a committee of one charged with the duty of dragging another Mercer man to the primaries.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Whoever the republicans nominate in the Second congressional district he will have an interesting fight at the polls.  This district is for free silver.  If the republican party in convention assembled at St. Louis says "D&#8212;n the people," the people of the Second district of Nebraska will say "D&#8212;n the republican party."</p>
                            <p>Once, at Liberty hall, General "Bob" Toombs made a statement that was here and there punctuated with mild profanity.  He appealed to Alexander H. Stephens with:  "Don't you agree with me, Mr. Stephens?"  The old commoner piped out shrilly:  "All but the damn, general, all but the damn."</p>
                            <p>It may be that if Dave Mercer is the nominee the g. o. p. in this district will be buried without profanity and with some tears, but the interment will certainly take place if the issue shall be squarely defined between the single gold standard and genuine bimetallism.</p>
                            <p>Mercer is popular now because he stood up for the west on one question.  When as the representative of his party he stands <unclear reason="cut off"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">Montana Should Make a Creditable Display at Omaha in 1898.</head>
                            <ab>Butte, Mont., May 9.</ab>
                            <p>To the Editor of The Butte Miner:&#8212;Dear Sir:  The origin of the trans-Mississippi and International Exposition of all the products, resources, industries and civilization of the states and territories west of the Mississippi river, embracing two-thirds of the area of the United States, to be held in Omaha, beginning in June and ending in December in the year 1898 is owing to a resolution passed by a rising vote of the Trans-Mississippi Commercial congress at it eighth annual session held at Omaha during the month of November last.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the Trans-Mississippi Congress, it is composed of the leading and representative men of all classes, professions and business interests of the states and territories lying west of the Mississippi river, who assemble at stated periods to discuss measures for promoting the commercial and material welfare of the region they represent, and recommend such measures as their judgment dictates to the national government, the states and the people for adoption.</p>
                            <p>These states and territories are, as they have been, increasing rapidly and reliable estimates indicate that certain sections are capable of supporting 70,000,000 people without crowding, still leaving a vast domain where the homeless can find millions of prosperous pursuits and homes.</p>
                            <p>That Omaha is in the midst of a large population and of great wealth is proved by drawing a circle having a radius of 500 miles, of which Omaha is the center.  The line intersects and covers 15 states east and west of the Mississippi river.  The people living in these states number over 20,000,000 according to the census of 1890, an increase of over 5,000,000 in 10 years.  The rapid growth of its principal cities, like St. Paul, Minneapolis, Des Moines, Omaha, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Lincoln, Sioux City, St. Louis, Kansas City, St. Joseph, New Orleans, Galveston, Dallas, Denver, Pueblo, Butte, Helena, Portland, Tacoma, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Salt Lake, Ogden, with Chicago and Milwaukee and numerous manufacturing centers on the east dependent upon them, to a large extent, that will be induced to visit the exposition and the west during the time it is held.</p>
                            <p>The management will not be local.  Each state and territory in the Trans-Mississippi region will have a share in it, through the appointment of a vice president or manager by the governor thereof, so that the full force and authority of the federal government and the government of each one of the interested states and territories will be fully enlisted in the great enterprise, which will outrival in splendor anything that has been witnessed in the country (excepting the Columbian Exposition).</p>
                            
                            <pb n="173" xml:id="TMISB01-173"/>
                            
                            <p>The house and senate of the United States have already recognized this exposition as being of an international as well as trans-Mississippi in character, it has already appropriated $200,000, of which $50,000 is for a government building and $150,000 for a government display.</p>
                            <p>All legislatures of the different states and territories which have been in session this winter, thus far have unanimously favored the exposition and have also appropriated a sum to make a creditable display of their resources.  The following states have already made appropriations, viz.:  Iowa, Louisiana, Utah, Arizona and Wyoming.  In the balance of the states and territories the legislatures do not convene until this fall.</p>
                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition company has been organized at Omaha, with a capital of $1,000,000, of which $500,000 is to be paid into the treasury immediately.</p>
                            <p>The gentlemen connected with the exposition company comprise some of Omaha's best business men, and they have the courage and enterprise to make a grand success of this exposition and they will.  The following well known <choice><sic>gentlement</sic><corr>gentlemen</corr></choice> were elected officers for the year 1896:  President, G. W. Wattles, vice president Union National bank; vice president J. E. Markel, president Pacific Hotel company; treasurer, Herman Kountze, president First National bank; secretary, John A. Wakefield, wholesale lumber.</p>
                            <p>Montana should awake to the importance and benefit arising from making a favorable showing of her resources and industries.  We have the material to make a showing no state in the union can duplicate, such as our minerals, wheat, barley, fruits, cattle, etc., which are as fine if not finer than raised anywhere.  There are thousands of people living in the New England and eastern states who have become dissatisfied with their homes there and will seek new locations in the great west, and no doubt Montana will get her share of this immigration, provided we make the proper effort to attract them this way, and no better opportunity can be had than at the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  The matter should be taken in hand by our board of trade and pushed as fast as possible.  Gov. Rickards should appoint a vice president at once, some one who is familiar with such work and who will make a proper showing to our legislature when they meet this fall, that they will make an appropriation large enough to erect a state building and a showing that will do credit to Montana, the "Treasure State" of the union.  No such opportunity has ever been offered Montana to advertise its resources and products to the world as this exposition will afford.  F. J. L.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><choice><sic>Nontana</sic><corr>Montana</corr></choice> Should Awaken to the Importance of this Exposition, and Should Make a Creditable Display of Her Resources.</head>
                            <p>To the Editor LIVINGSTON ENTERPRISE:  At the meeting of the Trans-Mississippi Congress, held in Omaha last November, it was resolved by a rising vote that the great region west of the Mississippi river should hold an exposition in which to show her wealth and resources to the people of the eastern states, and to try and induce immigration to this section of the country.  Omaha was selected as the place to hold this exposition, as it  was the most centrally located of any of the cities competing for the location.  The management is not to be local, but will be managed by a board of vice-presidents, who will be appointed by the governor of each state and territory comprising the trans-Mississippi region and one from the city of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The United States government has appropriated the sum of $250,000, of which sum $50,000 will be for a government building and $200,000 for a display.  The republic of Mexico has notified the exposition company that they would put a very fine state building and make a display that will compare with the one made at the Columbia exposition.  The state of Iowa has already appropriated $50,000 for the display of her resources.  The state of Nebraska will put up a handsome building that will cost close unto $250,000.  The states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and Colorado have made appropriations for buildings and displays.  Chili, Peru, Brazil, the republics of Cuba and Hawaii, Uruagua and other South American countries have signified their intention of taking part.</p>
                            <p>This exposition will afford a better opportunity for the states desiring to attract emigration, than the Columbia exposition, as the people who visited the latter, were wholly taken up with the foreign displays and did not even take time to look at the state displays, therefore it will be for our interest to make as grand a showing for our state as possible as this exposition will be the grandest ever gotten up for displays simply from the "American continent" and will be visited by the people from the New England and other eastern states who have become dissatisfied with their poor farming lands and will emigrate to the west if they could behold the wonderful products of this country and no doubt Montana would get her share.  Governor Rickards should appoint a vice-president for this state at once and should make the very best selection possible, a man who is well qualified to get the proper display together and then to make a showing with it after having gotten the same.  When the legislature meets this fall a sufficient sum ought to be set aside to make the showing Montana can, if she wants to.</p>

                            <p>From now until 1898 every man, woman and child whose interests are bound up in Omaha must put their shoulders to the wheel if the great Transmississippi exposition is to be made creditable to its builders and come up to the high expectations which have with reason been aroused in the people of the whole west.  The enterprise is of such stupendous magnitude, so much greater than any other single project which we have ever undertaken, that its success will demand the best energies and unceasing effort of every member of the community, each contributing in his own way according to his utmost abilities.</p>
                            <p>The first step to be taken is the more complete organization of the exposition association that has taken upon itself the management of the huge venture.  For this the most careful thought of our substantial business men is needed.  The financing of a great fair is no small matter, and without the requisite funds no work can be prosecuted.  The president of the exposition association has issued personal invitations to the leading merchants, jobbers, bankers and business men generally to attend a meeting at the Commercial club rooms tomorrow evening to discuss the situation and map out a policy for future operations.  It is to be hoped that no man who has received an invitation will fail to be present, unless unavoidably prevented.  "If the exposition is to be held," says President Wattles, "an assurance of the co-operation of the business interests of the city is necessary.  It is desired to discuss this matter at this time and reach a final conclusion as to whether the proposed exposition will be held."</p>
                            <p>The exposition will, of course, be held, but the measure of its success will depend upon the vim with which our people enter into the preliminary work.  With proper support, support which they have a right to expect, the managers will push the enterprise to rapid completion, and on the appointed day in the spring of 1898 open to the public an exposition the like of which has not been seen before or since the World's fair, and which will send fresh pulsations of prosperity through every artery of the entire transmississippi region.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>It all rests with the business and moneyed men of the city now whether or not the Transmississippi exposition is to be the big show that it was projected and was and is intended and hoped to me by the majority of the citizens of Omaha.  The decision is to be left in their hands at a meeting that is to be held on next Thursday night in the parlors of the Commercial club.  That was one of the matters decided by the directory of the exposition at a meeting last night.  The other was that the details of the proposed big rally, the time and place for holding it, should be left to the Commercial club.</p>
                            <p>The matter of a business men's meeting was brought up at once by C. S. Montgomery.  He stated that while the directory desired and intended to devote every energy to the exposition scheme, it was a plain impossibility for it alone to make it the success that it should be.  He said that it was an absolute necessity for it to obtain the moral backing of the merchants and capitalists in order for it to learn if it would have plenty of support when the work was begun.  On this statement of the case he presented the motion for the meeting and it was unanimously passed.  It was determined to send out invitations to all the merchants and moneyed men in Omaha to appear before the directory and present their opinions on the exposition.  This detail was left to a committee consisting of President Wattles, Secretary Wakefield, George H. Payne, C. S. Montgomery and Z. T. Lindsay.</p>
                            <p>It is to be partly understood that this meeting has not been called for the purpose of soliciting subscriptions.  It is simply intended to give the prominent men of the city an opportunity to inform the directory whether they intend to lend their support to the biggest show that the west has ever seen.  If support is assured the directory intends to begin active work at once.</p>
                            <p>This meeting will be a sort of a committee on ways and means to discuss how best to raise the $250,000 which must be subscribed before the government appropriation of $200,000 is available.  It is presumed that the money will be obtained by popular subscription to which all classes, from capitalists to laboring men, will be asked to donate.  The money is wanted by December 1 in order that work may be commenced.  Then the state, county and city will be asked for appropriations and the government appropriation will probably be increased.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles and other directors stated they did not think any great amount of difficulty would be met with in raising the necessary amount from business men.  For the money subscribed certificates of stock will be exchanged, which, from the experiences of other expositions, would prove in fact an investment, bringing returns.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield was urgent that money should be subscribed as once in order that the work should begin as soon as possible.  He stated it would require almost the full two years to get the exposition ready for the opening date.  In his opinion full $2,000,000 would be spent on the exposition.</p>
                            <p>From the remarks of the directors it was evident they believed that the union depot was now assured, as the railroads could not afford to delay the building of the structure much longer in order to properly care for the crowds that would attend the big show.</p>
                            <p>It was determined to invite the Commercial club to hold the big rally in celebration of the government recognition of the exposition.  The invitation is to be presented by a committee consisting of President Wattles, H. A. Thompson and A. Metz.</p>
                            <p>The Commercial club will be allowed to name the night of the celebration and arrange the details.  It is expected to occur some time during next week, possibly Tuesday.  This will allow the men who are desired to be present to return from the republican national convention in St. Louis.  The program is expected to be opened up with a big military and civic parade, containing bands of music and much red fire and other illuminations.  The meeting will be held after that in one or both the opera houses.  There Congressman Mercer, Senator Allen and the Iowa representatives who labored to pass the exposition bill, and prominent citizens, will make speeches.</p>

                            <p>There was practically no other business before the meeting.  Letters were received from a number of vice presidents, G. W. Parsons of California, William Neville of this state, and Thomas H. Wells of South Dakota reporting that they had begun to work for the exposition and were meeting with success.</p>
                            <p>Irene G. Williams of Missouri Valley asked the directory to examine a march she had composed and if it found it satisfactory to allow her to publish it as the official "Transmississippi march."</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska Homeopathic society asked the authority of the body to invite the American Institute of Homeopathy to meet in annual session in this city during the year of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A South Omaha firm asked the body to present a rubber stamp design which it could place upon all its letters to advertise the exposition.</p>
                            <p>J. H. Roberts applied for the directorship of the forestry department of the show.  He held the same position at the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>W. R. Bennett resigned his position as a member of the board of directors.</p>
                            <p>All these matters were laid over until the regular business meeting of the board.</p>

                            <head type="main">PLANS FOR A MASS MEETING</head>
                            <head type="sub">COMMITTEES WILL MAP OUT PROGRAM</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commercial Club Will Have Charge of the Matter and Will See that the Passage of Exposition Bill is Ratified.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>At the regular meeting of the directors of the Commercial club, held at noon today, it was decided that that organization will assume charge of the mass meeting to be held some time next week in honor of the passage of the exposition bill and will see that the celebration is in keeping with the importance of the occasion.</p>
                            <p>President G. W. Wattles of the Exposition association was present at the meeting and was called upon by Chairman Dumont to address the directors.  He explained that it had been thought best to ask the Commercial club to take charge of the celebration.  He dwelt at some length upon the importance of the exposition to this entire section of country.  It was necessary, he said, for every person in the city to co-operate with those having the exposition matter in charge in order that it may be made a success.  A mass meeting had been deemed the best means of bringing the great importance of this co-operation directly home to the consciousness of every resident of the city.  He suggested that every representative in congress from Nebraska, with the exception, possibly, of the populist member, and every representative from Iowa, all of whom had done valiant work in passing the bill, should be invited to be present and the occasion should be made a memorable one.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of the address, E. C. Price moved the appointment of a committee to carry out the suggestions of Mr. Wattles.  At the suggestion of G. W. Lininger the committee was made to consist of three and was given full power to appoint necessary subcommittees and carry out any plan it may formulate.  The chair appointed as this committee C. F. Weller, H. J. Penfold and J. E. Utt.  It was also decided that Chairman Dumont should act in conjunction with the committee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BUSINESS MEN TO MEET.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles then explained to those present the nature of the meeting of business men to be held at the Commercial club rooms next Thursday evening for the purpose of discussing the exposition and invited every member of the Commercial club to be present.</p>
                            <p>E. C. Price called attention to the dusty condition of the two roads leading to the fair grounds, Leavenworth and Center streets, and suggested that a committee be appointed to see if some means cannot be devised to have those streets paved inside the city limits to connect with the paving to be laid on Leavenworth street by the county commissioners up to the city limits, and with the paving on Center street, which now commences at the city limits.  After some discussion of this matter a motion to this effect was passed, and the chair appointed Messrs. E. C. Price, John Steel and Edgar Allen as such committee.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Utt called the attention of the committee to the meeting of the National Educational association which meets at Buffalo next month, and suggested that an invitation be extended to the association to meet in Omaha in 1898.  He enumerated various items of expense which would have to be guaranteed in order to secure the meeting, and said the association would bring about 12,000 people to Omaha during the week it would be in session.</p>
                            <p>It was suggested by Mr. Peters that it would be well to go slow about offering large inducements to conventions to come to Omaha in 1898, as the exposition would be about all the drawing card that would be necessary.  Chairman Dupont also added that it would be wise to avoid guaranteeing "ample hotel accommodations," as the probabilities were that the capacity of Omaha would be taxed to its utmost at that time.  After some discussion the matter was referred for investigation to a committee consisting of John Steel, J. E. Utt and E. V. Lewis.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FOR A DRY GOODS HOUSE.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Utt presented an advertisement which he had prepared for insertion in one of the leading dry goods trade organs, calling for the location of a large dry goods jobbing house in Omaha.  This was in accordance with action taken at the last meeting.  The advertisement stated that there is only one large jobbing house in this city.  It also stated that the wholesale grocery trade last year in this city amounted to $11,000,000, while the dry goods trade amounted to $4,000,000, whereas the ethics of trade showed that the totals of the grocery and dry goods trades should be about equal.  The advertisement also offered "extraordinary inducements" to one or more jobbing houses in this line to locate in Omaha.  It was ordered inserted in the leading dry goods organ.</p>
                            <p>O. C. Holmes reported upon his trip to Terre Haute in the interests of the Commercial club to invite the Travelers' Protective association to hold its meeting in Omaha in 1898.  A vote of thanks was extended to Mr. Holmes for his effective work in this connection.</p>
                            <p>T. P. Cartwright, Frank Colpetzer and A. P. Ely were admitted to membership in the club.</p>

                            <p>It is worthy of note that in the list of speakers at the Trans-Mississippi mass meeting the farmers are not represented.  There was no intention to slight anyone, but it will be well for a farmer to be elected to address the meeting.  Frank B. Hibbard of Irvington was one of the earliest friends of the exposition scheme.  He was the first man of any class to offer a contribution of cold cash.  It was Mr. Hibbard who first suggested and repeatedly urged Nebraska people to invite the congressmen from the states in which these people formerly lived.  The World-Herald suggests that Farmer Hibbard be added to the list of speakers.  As an orator Mr. Hibbard may not be able to turn any stones to mutiny, but in a gathering of enterprising citizens he is entitled to a front seat, and he never does anything by halves.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Race Meet at the Fair Grounds Was a Success.</head>
                            <p>Reports of the race meeting, showing an excess of receipts over expenditures of about $1,700, were received and approved by the Omaha Fair and Speed association at the weekly meeting held yesterday afternoon.  All bills incurred in connection with the races were ordered paid and satisfaction was expressed, the fact of its being the first race meeting being taken into consideration, at the financial showing made.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Farrell submitted a resolution, which was unanimously adopted, reciting that the street car service during the races had been totally inadequate, and that unless better facilities and management prevailed during the state fair there would be much dissatisfaction.</p>
                            <p>President Bennett said the impression that the grounds were too far away was erroneous, and due almost entirely to the poor service rendered by the street car company.  A committee, composed of Messrs. Farrell, Smith, Kelley, Wakefield and Bennett, was appointed to lay the matter before the street railway company.</p>
                            <p>A first-class bicycle track will probably be built in the near future.</p>

                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi exposition became a reality last night when the most enthusiastic meeting ever before held in Omaha took place.</p>
                            <p>It was at a meeting of the business men of Omaha called for the purpose of determining, first, if the exposition should <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>be</corr></choice> held; second, how the means necessary to its accomplishment should be obtained.</p>
                            <p>There were present over 250 of the leading business men of the city when the meeting was called to order in the Commercial club rooms by G. W. Wattles, president of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition association.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Wattles opened the celebration, for such it was, with a brief but thorough account of the nature of the exposition and the benefit it would be to Omaha and Nebraska.  In regard to the method of officering the exposition, Mr. Wattles said:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>

                            <p>"We must not allow our political or personal interests to stand in the way.  We must sacrifice our personal interests and expect to work without pecuniary reward.  For myself, I will not receive, directly or indirectly, any money for this purpose.  *  *  *  To make the exposition such a success as it must be, the city should appropriate a large sum, the state should do the same and the people of Omaha should contribute at least $250,000 to the enterprise.  I believe we can rely on Douglas county to do its share.  Senator Allen told me the other day that if we can raise the $250,000 he did not doubt but that $300,000 more could be obtained from the next congress and that he himself would introduce a bill to that effect."  At almost every pause Mr. Wattles was encouraged by shouts of applause.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MR. KOUNTZE'S GOOD IDEA.</head>
                            <p>Herman Kountze said that he could not estimate the benefit which the exposition would be to Omaha and Nebraska.  He urged that the question of its location should not be discussed until all necessary money had been raised, and cheers greeted the remark.</p>
                            <p>Judge Wright of Council Bluffs caused an almost interminable uproar on his statement of what Iowa will do to make the exposition the most remarkable ever held in America.  He read, amid a burst of cheers, the resolution adopted at a meeting in Council Bluffs a few days ago, in which the Bluffites pledged themselves "to this enterprise, wherever the exposition site may be located, our earnest co-operation and our due and full quota of that substantial aid necessary for and that shall be required to make it the grandest international exposition ever undertaken and held by the states of the American union."  He said there would be no difficulties in the way of success, and that Iowa could be depended upon to render its aid financially and otherwise to make the exposition the grandest show on earth.</p>
                            <p>Henry W. Yates said that it had been a surprise to him that the exposition matter had reached so far, and that his eyes had just been opened by the extent of the present meeting.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DR. MILLER ENTHUSIASTIC.</head>
                            <p>Dr. Miller likewise admitted surprise at the progress attained and advocated that the exposition authorities should go into intelligent communion with the representative men of all the states to be represented and to give them an active interest, so that they should awaken in their own states the necessary enthusiastic support.</p>
                            <p>W. S. Poppleton also made a strong speech as to the necessity of immediate and thorough action, and at his conclusion Dr. Miller said he had become so enthused that he must make a motion.  He moved that the board of directors of the Exposition association be authorized to select a committee of representative business men to discuss methods of raising the necessary money, and to report at another meeting like the present, which is to be called by the president of the association.  The motion was adopted without a dissenting voice.</p>
                            <p>Mr. E. Rosewater said that he did not favor giving it out that $250,000 would be sufficient for Omaha citizens to raise, but that the amount should be made at least $500,000, and that it would be easier to raise that amount than the smaller.  He said that in conversation with Congressman Dolliver and Senator Gear of Iowa, the latter told him he thought there would be no question about obtaining $500,000 from congress at the next session, and that he would work for it.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PULL TOGETHER.</head>
                            <p>The Hon. S. C. Woodson of St. Joseph, Mo, received shout after shout of approbation as he spoke of the magnificence of the enterprise.  He said the main point was for Omaha people to hold together, and not pull against each other in an attempt to obtain greater personal benefits.  That with concerted and unenvied action the exposition would be made such an affair as to draw the attention of the entire country to Omaha; make it the commercial center of the west: increase its resources, its population, its wealth, place all of its unemployed at work and bring thousands of people from other points to obtain a share of the work which the immensity of the enterprise would give; investors would be attracted by the advantages which Omaha would show at such an exposition, but without the united and harmonious action of Omaha citizens none of this could be accomplished.  "And Missouri will help."  (Cheers.)</p>

                            <head type="sub">MANY THOUGHT IT A DREAM AT FIRST</head>
                            <head type="sub">Unanimous Endorsement of the Transmississippi Congress Raised Up Enthusiastic Workers&#8212;Original Stock Subscribers.</head>

                            <p>Now that the first really formidable obstacle in the way of Omaha's great exposition has been surmounted, it is of interest to review the work that has been done so far and the efforts that have already been made by public-spirited citizens in behalf of the great enterprise.  The recent history of the exposition bill is a matter of general information, but the manner in which the idea was first promulgated and the means by which it was made to assume a practical form are not so generally known.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion out of which the present exposition project has developed, came from the editor of The Omaha Bee.  It was brought to public notice in the following editorial article which appeared in The Sunday Bee, November 25, 1895:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">A TRANSMISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>"The construction of the transcontinental railroads gave the first powerful impetus to the development of the transmississippi country.  Twenty-five years ago the population of the states and territories west of the Mississippi was 6,435,167, and the states and territories west of the Missouri were credited by the national census with a population of 1,492,896.  In 1890 the transmississippi states contained a population of 15,170,315, while the population of the states and territories west of the Missouri aggregated 5,917,213.  In 1860 there were only twenty-one miles of railroad in the country west of the Mississippi.  Today the railroad mileage in the same region exceeds 65,000 miles, of which 37,000 miles are boasted by the country west of the Missouri.</p>
                            <p>The marvelous resources of this vast empire were only in a measure displayed at the World's Columbian exposition.  In fact the exhibits of the western states and territories were to a great extent overshadowed by the international exhibits made at Chicago.  Of the hundreds of thousands of people who viewed the World's fair comparatively few carried away with them a distinct impression of the productive industries of the transmississippi states.  Even people who live in this section and who have contributed to its growth do not grasp their extent and magnitude.</p>
                            <p>"The inspiration for the Cotton States' exposition now being held in Atlanta doubtless lay in the conviction that an interstate exposition would go further toward promoting the development of the south than any other single agency.  That the judgment of the projectors of the Cotton States' exposition was eminently sound is attested by the success that has attended this great undertaking as regards both the number and variety of the exhibits and the financial management of the venture.  Not only have the people of the cotton states displayed commendable zeal in contributing toward its success with their displays, but several of the Atlantic states. notable New York and Pennsylvania, are creditably represented.  The Atlantic exposition has drawn hundreds of thousands of visitors from every section of the country and will be the agency by which a vast amount of new capital will be transplanted into the south.</p>
                            <p>"What has been accomplished for the south by the Atlanta exposition can be accomplished for the west by a transmississippi exposition.  With a population of 15,000,000 to draw on and a country prolific in material wealth, a transmississippi exposition would be an assured success from its very inception.  Such an exposition would give the impetus to the westward trend of population and capital for which the people of this section have been striving.  It would make known to all the world the capabilities of the great west and revive activity in every branch of industry and production.</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi congress, which convenes in this city during the present week, is the proper body to take the initiative in formulating the plan for a transmississippi exposition.  Its recommendation in this matter would have great weight with both the state and national legislatures.  Without disparaging any other city ambitious to secure the location of such an interstate exposition, The Bee believes that the claims of Omaha are far superior to those of all other transmississippi points.  Its location in the heart of the continent, midway between New York and San Francisco, makes it alike accessible to people east and west.  Its railroad facilities in every direction are as perfect as those of any city in the Mississippi valley north of St. Louis.  It is the center of the great agricultural belt and within a day's reach by rail of the mining region of Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota, and within two days' reach of the great mining states west of the Rockies.  Omaha is as near to the Puget sound country as is St. Paul, and nearer by 500 miles to San Francisco and southern California.</p>
                            <p>"It is hardly necessary to add that whatever is required of Omaha or pledged for Omaha to make the transmississippi exposition a success, the business men of this city will carry out to the letter."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">LONG CHERISHED IDEA.</head>
                            <p>Even previous to that an indefinite conception of such a plan had existed and was only waiting for a favorable opportunity.  Mr, E. Rosewater had long cherished the idea of a large mid-continent fair at Omaha and a permanent exposition that would make Omaha a sort of half-way house in the journey across the continent.  The present project was suggested by an article in the Minneapolis Tribune at the time of the national immigration convention, in which the idea of a mid-continent fair at Minneapolis was broached.  As the Transmississippi congress was to meet in Omaha in November, Mr. Rosewater and others with whom the idea had been discussed concluded that the opportunity was ripe and that if the endorsement of the congress could be secured there was no reason why the enterprise could not be successfully carried out.  From that time the matter was quietly worked up and arrangements were made to bring it before the congress when it assembled.</p>
                            <p>During the first two days of the congress the committee appointed for the purpose devoted itself to missionary work among the delegates.  In this work James Walsh took the lead, and it was largely through his efforts that a practically unanimous sentiment was created in favor of the resolution.</p>
                            <p>On Wednesday, November 27, and immediately after the various resolutions on the money question had been presented and referred, Hon. William J. Bryan left the chair and asked unanimous consent to offer this resolution:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth-producing states, would be of great value, not only to the transmississippi states, but to all the home-seekers in the world; therefore,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the United States congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a transmississippi exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September and October, 1898, and that the representatives of such states and territories in congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in carrying out this enterprise.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OMAHA UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED.</head>
                            <p>The reading was heard with marked attention and the conclusion was followed by a burst of applause.  Mr. Bryan briefly recounted the benefits that would accrue to the west by reason of the exposition, and indicated the numerous reasons why Omaha was the most favorable location.  John Doniphan of Missouri followed with a rousing speech in favor of the resolution, in which he eloquently portrayed the effect which the enterprise would have in calling attention to the boundless possibilities of the west and in building up its interests.  He was followed by H. G. Whitemore, George Q. Cannon of Utah and Howell Jones of Kansas.  Not a voice was raised against the resolution and when it was adopted by a rising vote the delegates united in a volley of cheers and hand clappings that continued for several minutes.</p>
                            <p>Nothing could be more gratifying than the enthusiastic unanimity with which the project had been approved by the transmississippi delegates, and with this favorable beginning the citizens of Omaha were encouraged to go forward.  The Transmississippi and International Exposition association was formally organized at a meeting held at the Commercial club rooms on the evening of January 18.  Z. T. Lindsey was made chairman and Judge L. H. Bradley presented the articles of incorporation which had been previously drawn up.  They fixed the capital stock at $1,000,000 in shares of $10 each and the association was authorized to transact business as soon as $10,000 had been subscribed.  A board of eleven directors was provided for and also twenty-five vice presidents, of whom one should be from Omaha and one from each of the twenty-four transmississippi states.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ORIGINAL STOCK SUBSCRIBERS.</head>
                            <p>On the suggestion of Mr. Rosewater, who contended that ninety days was too short a time in which to hold such an exposition as was contemplated, the articles were amended to provide that the exposition should be opened in June and closed in November, 1898.  They were adopted as amended and the necessary subscriptions of stock were immediately taken.  These original subscriptions were:  E. Rosewater, $506; W. J. Connell, $500; J. H. Evans, $500; Dan Farrell, jr., $500; Lee-Clarke-Andreesen Hardware company, $500; W. R. Bennett, $500; J. E. Markel, $500; Thompson, Belden &amp; Co., $500; William Krug, $500; Oscar Pickard, $500; Metz Bros., Brewing company, $500; Frank H. Hibbard, $500; Dudley Smith, $500; Kelley, Stiger &amp; Co., $500; John A. Weaver, $400; A. Clemens, $300; G. S. Ambler, $300; Z. T. Lindsey, $250; Lyman Richardson, $250; C. S. Montgomery, $200; L. H. Bradley, $200; I. W. Carpenter, R. W. Richardson, W. H. Roberson, George N. Hicks, M. H. DeLong, Euclid Martin, J. J. Gibson, J. E. Utt, Helin &amp; Thompson, W. C. Bullard, O. C. Holmes, C. S. Hayward and Johnson Bros., $100 each, and Fisher &amp; Lawrie, G. W. Wattles, J. A. Wakefield, G. H. Payne, G. A. Rathburn and I. E. Burdick, $50 each; total, $10,650.</p>
                            <p>The stockholders then met and elected the board of directors, consisting of H. A. Thompson, J. E. Markel, J. H. Evans, G. W. Wattles, G. H. Payne, C. S. Montgomery, W. R. Bennett, I. W. Carpenter, Dan Farrell, jr., Dudley Smith and Charles Metz.  A committee, consisting of Z. T. Lindsey, W. R. Bennett, Charles Metz, I. W. Carpenter and C. C. Belden, was appointed to solicit further subscriptions for stock.</p>
                            <p>The board of directors met at the Millard hotel on the following Monday and elected as officers G. W. Wattles, president; J. E. Markel, vice president; and John A. Wakefield, secretary.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MANY WERE DOUBTFUL.</head>
                            <p>The next step which confronted the promoters of the enterprise was the necessity of securing congressional recognition.  Even at this time there were many usually public-spirited citizens who were disposed to regard the scheme as visionary.  They said that not until a bill making an appropriation for the exposition had really passed congress could Omaha hope to carry it to completion.  The difficulty of getting a congressional appropriation in this year of economy, when congress was disposed to cut down all appropriations to the lowest possible minimum, was conceded, but the association and its supporters believed that it could be accomplished by united and continued effort, and events have justified their confidence.</p>
                            <p>A bill had already been introduced by Senator Allen on January 3, which had been referred to the special committee on international expositions, of which Senator Thurston was chairman.  It provided for the necessary recognition of the exposition by the government, the admission of foreign exhibits free of duty, and for a government exhibit of material from the Smithsonian institute, the United States Fish commission, the National museum and the various executive departments.  At the time of introduction the amount that was to be contributed by the government was left blank, but an expenditure of $50,000 was authorized for a government building and $20,000 additional for the transportation and care of the exhibits.</p>
                            <p>The main question before the promoters of the enterprise at this time was the amount that congress should be asked to contribute.  It was the opinion of Congressman Mercer, as well as Senator Thurston and Allen, that the bill would stand in a more favorable light if a proviso was inserted to provide that the amount donated by the government should be available only when a similar amount was raised by the people of Omaha.  This view was finally endorsed by the board of directors, and it was resolved to ask for an appropriation of $250,000, to be available when an equal amount had been raised at Omaha.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FIGHT FOR RECOGNITION.</head>
                            <p>The bill was introduced in the house by Congressmen Mercer, and until the senate bill was finally passed, on almost the last day of the session, the fight for its passage was continually waged.  At first the bill was handicapped in the house by the strong opposition of Senator Reed, who opposed it on the general ground of economy.  It was referred to the committee on ways and means, of which Mr. Reed's colleague, Martin Dingley, was chairman, and for some time it looked as though it would die in the committee's hands.  The senate bill was reported back early in March, after the appropriation had been cut down to $200,000, which was the amount contributed to the Atlanta exposition.</p>
                            <p>Then the main fight centered in the house, where Mr. Mercer and his friends were working day and night in its interest.  Before Mercer's determined efforts the opposition which had originally confronted the bill began to disappear.  As the members were made to realize the importance of the enterprise and the benefits that it would bring to the entire transmississippi region, its opponents were won over until it became one of the most popular measures before the house.  But some difficulty was still experienced in getting a favorable report from the ways and means committee, and on April 10 Senators Thurston and Allen called up the senate bill, which had been held in the hope of securing the passage of the house bill, which carried the full appropriation of $250,000.  It was passed by unanimous consent, and as no other course was then open, it was decided to introduce the senate bill in the house.  President Wattles of the Exposition association, and Henry F. Wyman were in Washington at the time in the interests of the bill, and on April 20 he appeared before the house committee, together with Congressmen Mercer, Andrews and Kem, and made a vigorous plea for the bill.  He left for Omaha that night with the assurance that the bill would be favorably reported after the amendment obligating Omaha to raise $250,000 had been incorporated.  The report was presented by Congressmen Dolliver of Iowa on the following afternoon and placed on the file for passage.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">BATTLE NOT YET WON.</head>
                            <p>It seemed that the battle had been won, but it required another tremendous effort to secure recognition for the bill.  Scores of measures were demanding consideration, and in the hurry to close the session it seemed likely that Speaker Reed would neglect to recognize the exposition bill and that it would lay over until the next session.  All possible pressure was brought to bear on the speaker for recognition.  Congressman Mercer and others who had been interested worked like beavers, and Senator Allen lent his enthusiastic assistance.  Finally Mr. E. Rosewater went to Washington at the request of the exposition association and spent several days in working for the bill.  Before he left the promise of Senator Reed to recognize the bill for action by the house had been secured.  How the hopes of the friends of the bill were crushed at the instant of fulfillment by the action of Congressman Kem, and again by the objection of Congressman Bailey, is recent history.  The final triumph came when they had almost ceased to hope, and the news that the bill had finally passed was received in Omaha with an enthusiasm almost unprecedented.</p>
                            <p>Early this week a public meeting will be called, at which the next steps in the undertaking will be formulated.  The Iowa legislature has already authorized an appropriation of $25,000 for their state exhibit, and the legislatures of Nebraska and other states will now be called on to do their share.  The various bureaus necessary to carry on the enterprise will soon be organized, and active preparations for the big fair will soon be under way.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Enthusiastic Meeting of Business Men to Discuss the Exposition Project.</head>
                            <head type="sub">ALL READY TO LEND A HELPING HAND</head>
                            <head type="sub">Officers Given to Understand in an Emphatic Manner that Their Efforts Will Be Sustained&#8212;United for One Purpose.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>In the Transmississippi and International exposition, to be held in 1898, Omaha is to have the greatest exposition that the west has ever known, one of the grandest that has ever been given in the United States and one that will rank way up in the list of the expositions of the world.  City bars, state bars and even western bars are to be thrown down, and while the exposition will be distinctively western, it will be national and even international in its scope.  It is to be second only to the World's Columbian exposition of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>This is the way the business and moneyed men of the city decided at a huge mass meeting held in the Commercial club rooms last night at the call of the directory of the exposition company.  The decision is equal to a promise signed in black and white by the capitalists and business men of the city.  The majority of these were there and they stood up like men and promised it in no equivocal way.</p>
                            <p>The meeting has never had its parallel in the city's history.  No such band of business men, bankers, capitalists and men of prominence has ever gathered together for one purpose before since the city was founded, not even in the days of the boom.  There were over 300 present, more than the parlors of the club could hold, and they represented considerably more than the majority of the business and capital of the city.</p>
                            <p>More than anything else, they were all of unanimous opinion and that was of enthusiasm over the project.  All the speakers expressed surprise at the object of the meeting, which was to discover whether the money and business of the city would back the officers of the company in their huge project.  They felt and said that the exposition was a go and must be a success.  Those present cheered and clapped the sentiments of speakers continuously, a very unusual procedure for soberminded business men considering a business proposition where large amounts of money are in the balance.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">STATED WHAT WAS WANTED.</head>
                            <p>It was shortly after 8 o'clock that President Wattles of the company called the meeting to order and explained the object that had led to the call.  He stated that the officers did not feel competent to take the burden upon their shoulders without being assured that the business and moneyed men of the city were with them unanimously.  All the various personal and political interests of the business world would need to be submerged for the general good of the community rule if the project was brought to a successful close.  The officers were actuated by that belief, and therefore at the present time would not even consider the question of a site, thinking that the time had not come for that.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles continued to the effect that the officers did not desire that the money to be expended should pass through their hands, and therefore suggested that a finance committee of business men be selected to handle and expend it.  He said that a great deal of money would need to be raised in this city.  If a proper spirit was shown by the business men and capitalists in this regard, he felt confident from the conversation he had with prominent congressmen that the government appropriation would be ultimately increased to at least $500,000.</p>
                            <p>The speaker stated he did not believe that Omaha realized the importance of the project of the exposition as much as the other western states.  He said that in the recent trip of the exposition committee through the west it was found that the states looked upon Omaha as the future metropolis of the section, and upon the exposition as an immense advertising medium of their resources.  Each state visited had promised ample aid from the legislatures for the project.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles then spoke of the cost of the recent expositions held throughout the country, and then went on to the Omaha exposition.  He said that the state would be asked to make a large appropriation, the city another, the county another, but that it was necessary to obtain money to begin work at once and to get the government appropriation.  Therefore, it was proposed to ask the citizens of Omaha and the surrounding country to subscribe to $250,000 worth of stock.</p>
                            <p>"This being the situation, it is now for you to decide once for all whether the exposition will be held," said Mr. Wattles.  "Unless each and every business man and capitalist is willing to lend his support it would be needles to put the burden of the exposition on the directory."</p>
                            <p>President Wattles' remarks were followed by several minutes of clapping.  Speakers were at once called upon.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HAS FAITH IN THE PROJECT.</head>
                            <p>Herman Kountze was the first.  He spoke conservatively from a capitalist's standpoint, but was very favorable to the project.  He said that in his opinion the exposition was a matter of the greatest importance to Omaha and he believed that with proper effort the amount desired from the city, county and citizens, about $600,000, could be obtained.  He was very urgent, however, that in order to make the affair the success it was desired all business men should lay aside the idea of personal aggrandizement and work for the general good.  He believed that no thought should be taken of the location until the money to be subscribed should be obtained.</p>
                            <p>He made two suggestions.  One was that the project should not be made a stepping stone to position and that therefore no man should be employed who was not fully capable of performing his duties.  The other was to the effect that the business men should be ready to sacrifice not only their time but their business to bring about a success.  He said that if they were not ready to do that it was of no use to carry the on the project, as a few could not carry the burden.</p>
                            <p>Frank Murphy responded in but a few words to a call.  He said that he was not then ready to make any lengthy remarks, but stated that he desired to see the exposition forwarded to the great success it was planned to be.</p>
                            <p>George F. Wright of Council Bluffs was one of the most enthusiastic.  He pointed to the demonstration in Council Bluffs over the passage of the congressional bill as an evidence of the way the people of the city across the river felt over the project.  In this connection he read the following resolution that had been passed at the meeting:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the people of Iowa, and more particularly of Council Bluffs, hereby extend hearty congratulations to the directors of the Transmississippi and International exposition and people of Omaha upon the final passage of the exposition bill by congress.  We also pledge ourselves to give, wherever the exposition site may be located, our earnest co-operation and our due and full quota of that substantial aid necessary and that shall be required to make it the grandest exposition ever undertaken and held by the states of the American union, at all times relying upon the assurance given that in everything connected therewith our interests and welfare at all times will receive fair and impartial consideration at the hands of the directory.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wright believed that the amount asked of the citizens of this vicinity in subscription was small and he thought that no difficulty would be found in obtaining it.  He promised that Council Bluffs would give its share and that the state would not be backward.</p>
                            <p>Captain W. W. Marsh responded in a few brief remarks, in which he fully seconded the sentiments of previous speakers.  He said that every citizen should feel the importance of the exposition and respond in a liberal manner.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MUST OUTSHINE OTHERS.</head>
                            <p>Henry W. Yates stated that the officers were entitled to a vast amount of credit for the work they had done in bringing the project to its present state, and admitted that he was surprised at the results, as he had never believed that congress would give the appropriation.  He said that the exposition was now assured, and the question remained was regarding the kind of an exposition it was to be.  He held that above all it was to be a creditable one.  It must be equal to any ever given, except the World's fair.  To accomplish this success, he said that every man in the city must put his shoulder to the wheel.  He suggested that a committee on ways and means be appointed to raise the necessary money, with which to start the project.  This committee was to be continually in harmony with the board of directors, and should be composed of the moneyed and influential men of the city.</p>
                            <p>Dr. George L. Miller confessed that he had at first believed the idea of an exposition was a visionary age, but was compelled to admit now that the younger business men of the city were greater hustlers than the "old seeds" and said he intended to try to "catch up with the tail end of the procession."  He warned the projectors not to allow the exposition to become an Omaha or a state affair, but to make it an interstate and even national one.  He advised especially that when the agencies in control were being formulated state lines should be overlooked and representative men from other states be brought into the councils.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MUST GET TO WORK AT ONCE.</head>
                            <p>He urged that steps be at once taken in getting to work, especially in obtaining aid from state legislatures.  He especially advised that the Louisiana state legislature be speedily invoked, as it is in session.  Locally he believed that every citizen, rich and poor, should subscribe for as much stock as he could, as it was to the interest of everyone to bring back an era of prosperity to the city again.</p>
                            <p>Will S. Poppleton was confident that the exposition would be held, and promised that the young men of the city would do everything in their power to make it a success.  He held that Omaha was under moral obligations to go ahead with the project, now that the government had given aid and the states had promised it.  He was favorable to the idea of putting the finances in the hands of the best men of the city, as he believed then the citizens would have confidence that subscriptions would be properly spent and money would be forthcoming readily.  He had no doubt of the success of the exposition, as the states of the west never have had an opportunity to advertise their resources and would assist to the utmost of their ability.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Miller, at this point, presented a resolution, by which the board of directors was bidden to select a large committee of ways and means, whose duty it shall be to raise the money.  It is to be composed of the moneyed men of the city, and will report at a future meeting, to be called by President Wattles.  The number will probably be between fifteen and twenty-five.  This resolution was passed unanimously.</p>
                            <p>"The exposition is bound to be held here in 1898," began Edward Rosewater, the next speaker called upon, "our reputation is at stake.  Our claims have been presented to congress and have been recognized and we cannot afford to back out now."</p>
                            <p>Continuing, Mr. Rosewater stated that in a recent visit to St. Louis, where he was present at the republican national convention, he had spoked to the Iowa representatives and they, especially Senator Gear, were confident that the government appropriation would be increased $500,000.  He had also received assurance from members of delegations from New Mexico, Idaho and other western states that everything would be done to have all the states fully represented.  Mr. Rosewater therefore held that the only thing remaining was to raise the money and get to work.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SHOULD RAISE HALF A MILLION.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater did not believe that it was advisable to ask the citizens for only $250,000 of subscriptions, but thought the amount should be raised to $500,000.  He did not believe the burden would be too great, and held that the subscriptions of that amount would obviate any necessity of calling upon the citizens for more money.  He urged that the money should be subscribed as soon as possible, in order to obtain the additional appropriation from the government and the other from the state.</p>
                            <p>In his remarks Mr. Rosewater stated that the exposition would cost between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000.  Dr. Miller asked if he had not stated that the cost would be less if a scheme of Mr. Rosewater's, to bunch state exhibits in large buildings, was adopted.  In answer Mr. Rosewater said that he believed in overestimating instead of underestimating, in projecting larger ideas and consequently intentions, instead of smaller ones.  He maintained that each of the states would appropriate $15,000 to $50,000, the government would give $700,000, the state $250,000, and the city council and citizens $1,000,000.</p>
                            <p>Hon. S. C. Woodson of St. Joseph, ex-governor of Missouri, made an enthusiastic speech, in which he particularly predicted that if Omaha citizens pulled together they would make a big exposition, if they pulled asunder they would make a failure.  He was urgent, too, that the scope of the affair should be interstate and national, appropriate to the situation of the city in the center of the United States.  He promised that his state would assist with an appropriation.  He advised the citizens to subscribe to stock liberally, saying that it would be the "best money they ever spent in advertising."</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock fell in with Mr. Rosewater's idea to aim high and pledge deeply, "not making a gift, but an investment."  He held that the exposition would establish Omaha as the transmississippi city, giving it pre-eminence over all its rivals and bringing capital and population to it.</p>
                            <p>Judge Neville of North Platte, the vice president of the state, stated that the western part of the state was in the project with its whole soul, and would elect members to the legislature pledged to appropriate a handsome amount for the exposition.  He believed that the exposition would attract all the states in the union.  He also was in favor of the committee of the business men in the city to raise the money.  He said that every dollar pledged would not only return in advertising, but in dollars, and would insure the future prosperity of the state and the west.</p>
                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick presented a resolution, which authorized the directors to go ahead with the work outlined, at their discretion, and pledged them the support of the business men and capitalists of the city.  This resolution was passed with a great whoop.</p>
                            <p>E. A. Benson offered two resolutions, one thanking the officers of the company for the work already done, and thanking the people of Council Bluffs for their offer of support.  Both were passed.</p>
                            <p>W. A. Webster, in behalf of the establishments of East Omaha, pledged support wherever the exposition was located, saying that when the time came they would make a bid for the site on the island.</p>

                            <p>An enthusiastic meeting of Fifth warders was held at Erfling's hall on Sherman avenue last night for the purpose of talking up the exposition.  A temporary organization was effected by electing ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, president; Hugh A. Meyer, vice president; David H. Christie, secretary; C. O. Lobeck, treasurer.</p>
                            <p>The question of advocating the locating of the exposition in the north end of the city was discussed at some length and it was the consensus of opinion that the first <unclear reason="torn"/> be done would be to assure the

                            financial part of the preliminary work and let the question of the location be settled on its merits.  It was decided that Miller park and the surrounding property, which it was announced could be secured rent free, would be a most desirable location, but it was also decided, at the same time, that other questions took precedence over that of location.</p>
                            <p>The meeting adjourned to meet at the same place next Thursday evening, when a mass meeting of all persons in the north end of the city will be held for the purpose of effecting a permanent organization to aid the exposition and, incidentally, to secure its location in the north end of the city.  All residents and property owners in the Fifth, Sixth and Eighth wards are invited to attend and assist in making the organization a large one.</p>

                            <p>The preliminary work for a big display at the Trans-Mississippi exposition should commence now in the preparation of exhibits.  The crop of 1896 will in all probability be one of the most remarkable for the growth of many agricultural plants that the western country has ever experienced.  There will be samples of seed and sheaf grain and grasses that will astonish the world with their immense growth and perfectness of development; such samples cannot be grown every year and only under the most favorable conditions of moisture, soil and atmospheric influences can the farmer hope to be in possession of these fine specimens, which show the possibilities of our soil.</p>
                            <p>Every country fair association in the state should see to it that competent committees be appointed and authorized to select and carefully store away in suitable covering and packing such exhibits as are not perishable and which would be difficult to duplicate only under the most favorable conditions of growth.</p>
                            <p>We want to see Nebraska represented at the coming exposition with the best its soil will produce and coming from every country within her borders.</p>
                            <p>The products of the irrigated districts on the western side of the state will be present, let the moisture conditions be as they may.  The evidences of irrigation are now a part of the agricultural history of Nebraska and it only remains to demonstrate to what extent artificial moisture influences will add to the value of natural conditions in growing crops.</p>
                            <p>There is no county in the state that has not produced crops of grains and grasses which would be a credit to any agricultural district of the country.  The display made by Nebraska in 1898 should not only be large and complete in variety, but should be excellent in quality and finish in all that pertains to an attractive exhibit.</p>

                            <p>The exposition idea is now dominant.  At first it had only a few advocates.  Gradually they increased week by week, <unclear reason="covered"/><!-- Looks like some sort of error with the JPEG itself --> numbers.</p>
                            <p>When the bill passed congress many who had not believed the exposition possible awoke to realize that it was a fact.</p>
                            <p>The feeling of this city was admirably shown at Thursday's meeting, crowded as it was with business men and enthusiastic as it was in spirit.  Many were agreeably surprised at the attendance and at the enthusiasm and the exposition became at once more than ever to Omaha the one all-important thing of the future.</p>
                            <p>Today the ways and means committee holds its first meeting and begins its great work.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Congressman Mercer arrived in the city yesterday from Washington to renew his acquaintance with his constituents, and incidentally to puncture a few congressional booms which have taken root in the community.  He was waylaid on all sides by friends who were eager to grasp his hand and congratulate him upon his success in congress, and his progress up town was slow.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer says that congress, as a body, is opposed to expositions&#8212;a fact he considers to be apparent to any one familiar with the history of that body.  The World's fair bill was held up for nine days and its friends almost despaired before they had is passed.  The Atlanta bill was passed after much opposition, and that it was passed is what unquestionably saved the Trans-Mississippi bill, for the west could not be consistently refused what had been granted the south.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>He says that many men who opposed his bill did so from a conscientious standpoint, being opposed to all such appropriations, but most of those conveniently absented themselves from the floor when the Trans-Mississippi bill was called up.  The president, he adds, is also opposed to expositions, and signed the bill largely for the reason that a similar favor had been done in the case of the Atlanta exposition; but the president remarked at the time that he thought all this exposition legislation would come to an end with the Trans-Mississippi show.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer says the eastern people are interested in this project and feel that it will be a grand exposition.  They reason that nothing of the kind has ever been held in this section of the country, and that the people will be interested in it; that the mid-winter show did not have much influence east of the mountains, while all that territory between the Rockies and the Mississippi would feel an interest in this new exposition as being more of a home attraction of which they were a part and parcel.  He had heard men from the mining states and from the south states say they were going to be present with exhibits, and predicting a great success for the enterprise.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MAY RECALL FORT OMAHA VETO.</head>
                            <p>On the Fort Omaha bill Mr. Mercer says he told the president he thought it a mistake to veto the bill, and assured him that the government was amply protected in its rights by the measure.  But the president replied that if the land was leased to the state he feared the string would be cut, and the state might sell property if it saw fit.  Mr. Mercer said he then called attention to the cloud which hangs over the title, and the probabilities of the land reverting back to the donors in the event it should be used for anything else than for military purposes, and he thinks that on this line the president may be persuaded to recall the veto, or submit a supplemental message to the same effect.  In the event that neither of these steps should be taken, Mr. Mercer says the veto is still in the hands of the military committee and it may be called up at the next session of congress and passed over the president's negative action.  In the mean time, however, he thinks nothing would be done with the property.</p>
                            <p>The nomination of McKinley had been expected by all the politicians at Washington for several weeks, and they were therefore prepared for the announcement when it came.  He thinks Platt was only making a bluff to secure a sound money platform and that when that was accomplished his campaign was at an end.  He says the gold plank has been well received in the east and the people there are delighted with it.  As to Senator Teller, he pronounces the Colorado man as one who is respected by everybody, a lovable man, able and fearless, yet notwithstanding the bolt of the silver men in Nebraska congressman things the republican national ticket just nominated will sweep the country.  While Mr. Hobart, the republican nominee for vice president, is not very well known to the country, he stands high in the east, and has an extensive acquaintance there.  He is a prosperous business man and has that appearance, being also a vigorous worker in politics in the little eastern state where his home is located.</p>

                            <p>Coming down to local politics, the congressman became at once just Dave Mercer, whom everybody knows.  He said his coat was already off and he would not put it on till the local contest was over and he had the nomination, impressing upon the interviewer the fact that he felt he was going to win.  He had noticed the active campaign being made in the First and Seventh wards by his opponents, but advised his friends to watch the campaign he would put up in all the wards, in all the precincts and in all the counties.  After the congressional nomination has been satisfactorily disposed of he would go to Washington to look after his duties as secretary of the republican congressional committee, and alternate between the two cities during the campaign.</p>
                            <p>When asked if he would accept E. J. Cornish's challenge for a joint debate, Mr. Mercer said he had not heard of any such challenge, and added: "I will cross that bridge when I come to it."</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOSSIP OF THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Politics has been an absorbing topic the last week.  All eyes have been fixed upon St. Louis to see what the "party of Abraham Lincoln" expected to do for the country.  Although there are plenty of politicians in Omaha, yet the majority of people have been seriously thinking of what will be the success of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, and its attending benefits.  Now that the bill has passed, the directors of the exposition met the first of the week and decided to leave it to the business and moneyed men of the city whether they should go ahead and take the important initiatory steps toward starting the practical foundations of the enterprise.  If the sentiment of the business men was that it would be too much of a burden for the people of Omaha and the state of Nebraska to carry, there would be no use in going any further.</p>
                            <p>So the business men met at the Commercial club Thursday night.  It was then apparent that the most enthusiastic promoters of the movement are among the conservative and prudent merchants and business men.  They exhibited enthusiasm far in excess of what had been anticipated.  Some of the directors had even gone so far as to say that it would be impossible to secure a meeting of business men to talk over the subject.  But as was expressed by many of them publicly and privately, those who have large businesses and capitalistic interests in Omaha thoroughly believe that for every dollar expended for the exposition ten or more will be returned to them.  Well, the meeting  proved a delicious surprise to those who had called it.  Enthusiastic speeches were made and some expressed the belief that $250,000 was all too small an amount for the directors of the company to attempt to raise.  Double that sum, it was said, could be secured as easily.  The upshot of it all was that a unanimous resolution was passed urging the directors to push the work of raising the money and pledging the support of the citizens assembled.</p>
                            <p>There are some chronic kickers, of course, who don't know a good thing when they see it, or won't see it if they do know it.  But as a prominent attorney with large real estate interests, said the other day:  "The Trans-Mississippi exposition will add thousands and even millions of dollars to the value of real estate in Omaha."  Another man said he was in favor of the exposition, but he thought that if it would result in the bringing of three good jobbing firms to the city that alone would compensate for all expense.</p>

                            <p>"It isn't poor crops that has hurt the west for the last few years," said a commercial man at the Millard.  "I've been traveling in Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota and other western states now for about seventeen years and I know the country pretty well.  Poor crops or good crops would have made little difference.  It's tight money; that's what it is.  Money has been afraid of itself, has hid off in the corners and refused to circulate.  I know the remedy for it, I think, and so does Senator Teller, but we won't speak of that now.  The Trans-Mississippi exposition will do a whole lot toward loosening this straitened condition of the circulating medium in the west.  Just let people get to talking about it and once active preparations are in progress, you will see a marked improvement in the condition of things.  I know what I am talking about.  And traveling men generally are feeling this way.  We are all glad to see this exposition movement so well started.  It will be a grand thing for Omaha especially.  Just think of the amount of money that will be spent here in the next two years preceding the event besides the benefit indirectly and directly to be received from the enterprise itself.  It is planned on a magnificent scale so far.  If successful it will be a hummer, and will open the eyes of a great many people."</p>

                            <p>H. G. Alger of Sheridan, Wyo., was at the Paxton during the week, while on his return trip from a visit in New York state.  Mr. Alger is a thoroughly western man, moving to Montana about fifteen years ago.  He dropped down into the town of Sheridan when it was a settlement of a little more than 100 people, started a bank there and was soon largely interested in the great state of Wyoming.  He is one of the trustees of the Shoshone Irrigation company, which is irrigating 70,000 acres in the Big Horn country.</p>
                            <p>"There is no doubt that the exposition will be a great thing for the whole west," said Mr. Alger.  "I am a thorough believer in expositions on general principles.  They are a whole lot of work for somebody, but as far as expense is concerned, they more than pay out every time.  It is advertising on a large scale, advertising that is most practical and effective.  And the Trans-Mississippi exposition country ought to put up a great show.  Those people who think that there is nothing out here but sand piles and Indians wandering over drouthy wilderness will be enlightened.  I am greatly impressed with the worth of my own state, of course.  It is the Pennsylvania of the west.</p>
                            <p>"The Big Horn basin alone is as large as the combined area of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.  Then a great many people have an idea a whole lot of land in Wyoming is no good for any purpose whatever.  They saw it a number of years ago, before irrigation was practiced and the resources of the country were known.  It is just such misconceptions that can be corrected by this exposition.  Wyoming will have a good exhibit, I am sure.  Of course we have been waiting on that bill before congress.  Now that it is passed, no doubt plans will be laid to see what the state and individuals expect to do.  I have no doubt that the legislature will make a generous appropriation, and Wyoming, which wants the benefit, will be represented here in first-class style."</p>

                            <p>"The Trans-Mississippi exposition will be a great big success," said Willis Sweet, one of the Idaho delegates to the St. Louis convention, at the Millard yesterday afternoon.  Mr. Sweet is one of the delegates who signed the silver manifesto and is a quiet, agreeable gentleman, with the general appearance of one who possesses a large amount of reserve force stored away for emergency.  It may be said, incidentally, that he was once a typo on the Lincoln State Journal.  "All the progressive western states will be vitally interested in its success.  And twenty-four states and territories can make a big showing.  I am satisfied that Idaho will be well represented.  You remember what a magnificent fruit exhibit the state had at the World's fair?  The agricultural exhibit was partly burned while passing through Nebraska, but in fruits there wasn't a better display on the grounds.  You can just put it right down that Idaho will have fruit exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi exposition second to that of no state in the union.</p>
                            <p>"Do I believe in such enterprises?  Very firmly.  A great many people have an idea that all we have in our state is a few silver mines and mining towns.  They don't know what a fine agricultural and horticultural region it is.  Even after the showing which was made at the World's fair, many people are ignorant of the true wealth and resources of the state.  Idaho will certainly make a creditable appropriation and do everything she can to make the big fair a success.  There isn't a man in Idaho, of course, who will not favor such a commendable enterprise, which is an opportune advertisement for the west."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Finance Committee Sets the Stock Subscription at Half a Million.</head>
                            <head type="sub">HALF MUST BE PROVIDED FOR SOON</head>
                            <head type="sub">Plans for Raising the Money Will Be Submitted to a Meeting to Be Held Monday Evening&#8212;Increase in the Committee.</head>
                            <p>The committee appointed at the exposition mass meeting to recommend ways and means for carrying the financial burden of the enterprise, met at the Commercial club yesterday afternoon and spent nearly three hours in exchanging ideas and working out some definite line of action.  It was the general opinion of the members that it was absolutely necessary that at least $250,000 should be raised in stock subscriptions in Omaha and vicinity as soon as possible and most of them inclined to the opinion that the mark should be set somewhat higher.  The result of their deliberations was the passage of a resolution making the recommendation that $500,000 should be raised by stock subscriptions and that a committee be recommended to raise subscriptions, receive and disburse the funds and have full charge of the finances of the exposition.  The committee as recommended includes:  Herman Kountze, chairman; H. W. Yates, Guy C. Barton, J. H. Millard, Frank Colpetzer, Victor B. Caldwell, W. S. Poppleton, Frank Murphy, A. L. Reed, R. P. Kirkendall, Casper E. Yost, E. E. Bruce, Z. T. Lindsey, E. Rosewater, W. A. Paxton, G. W. Wattles, Ed Cudahy, John A. Creighton, George W. Lininger, Charles F. Manderson, Omaha; Harold McCormick, Lucus Wells, Council Bluffs; David Anderson, South Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The committee was called to order by Mr. Wattles, after which Mr. Lininger was elected chairman.  Mr. Wattles briefly stated the problem which confronted the committee and that $250,000 was the least possible amount that would answer as the Omaha subscription.  Mr. Rosewater thought the amount should be placed at $500,000 with a provision that only 10 or 15 per cent of amount subscribed should be assessed during 1896.  He asserted that it would not do for the exposition association to depend on any direct donation from the city, county or state.  Under the law the city could make a minimum levy for park purposes and devote the proceeds to the <choice><sic>improvment</sic><corr>improvement</corr></choice> of the exposition grounds in case they were located inside the city limits.  The county could make a liberal appropriation for an exhibit and so could the state, but for the erection of the main buildings and the preliminary expenses of the undertaking the funds must be provided in another way.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lininger suggested that in his opinion the entire amount could be raised in twenty-four hours by a popular subscription.  He advocated the designing of a holiday for that purpose, appointing a committee of 500 or 1,000 members to be distributed in the various voting precincts and bring the people out to the booths to give subscriptions just as the voters were brought out on election day.  This plan, however, was not favorably received.  It was argued that it might be well enough to obtain a popular subscription after a time, but the big subscriptions must come first.  The money would be raised a good deal easier after the men who were heavy property owners had signed for large amounts.</p>
                            <p>After a prolonged discussion it was decided that the committee should recommend the appointment of the finance committee.  This was originally composed of twenty-one members, but was finally extended to twenty-five.  The recommendations of the committee will be submitted at another meeting which will be held next Monday night.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>OMAHA, June 16.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  I read with pleasure the article in The Sunday Bee of June 14, giving the history of the progress of the Transmississippi exposition and do most willingly commend you most earnest and active approval and support of this enterprise, not only individually, by your personal effort and substantial aid, but the solid, vigorous support of your paper, The Omaha Bee, through its local, telegraphic and editorial columns, and I am frank to say that in a very large measure the success of the exposition so far is due to your individual efforts.  I think the article referred to is in error in this, that it claims the original suggestion of the exposition through an editorial in The Bee of November 25.</p>
                            <p>You will remember that I had the honor to be one of the delegates to the congress at its session in St. Louis, November, 1894, and our delegation at that time saw an opportunity to secure the next session of the congress for this city.  I, as chairman of the delegation, telegraphed to this effect to Mayor Bemis, and his answer came to secure the session if possible and Omaha would royally welcome the congress.  With this reply, and the support of Hon. W. J. Bryan, who had many strong friends in the congress, Omaha secured the prize.  Following this, and during the months of August and September last year, it was necessary to interest our citizens that the arrangements might be effected to properly receive and entertain the congress at its coming session in November following.  Our people were very much interested at that time in the success of the state fair and the financial burdens that it imposed.</p>
                            <p>The Commercial club hesitated to assume the responsibility of meeting the expense necessary to entertain congress, and would shift the burden of this upon the mayor, who had extended the invitation, and the individuals instrumental in bringing the congress here.  The prospect at this time looked rather gloomy for this city to be able to fulfill its promise to properly entertain the congress.  Judge Bradley, head of its executive committee for Nebraska, and myself having the honor to be vice president for this city and state, called upon his honor, Mayor Bemis, to consider the situation.  I suggested at this conference that a letter of invitation be sent to 100 or 150 of our leading business men and citizens, setting forth the object, interest and importance of this session of the congress.  I suggested as a drawing card the idea of a Transmississippi exposition; that as our people were deeply engrossed in the state fair enterprise that it would be ripe to suggest an exposition of this kind, and as Omaha would entertain the congress at its coming session, it might secure the location of the same.  This suggestion was promptly acted upon and the mayor stated that if I would draft the letter he would have it printed and mailed.  This I accepted and enclose you a copy of the original draft which was mailed, I think, by Private Secretary Millar, to more than 125 of our leading citizens, which brought together a strong representative meeting at the mayor's office.  With the success which followed this effort you are familiar.</p>
                            <p>I do not desire in the least to suggest any controversy or claim any undue credit, but relying on your high sense of justice, I believe you will give credit where same is properly due.  I am yours very respectfully,</p>

                            <p>Mr. .........., City&#8212;Dear Sir:  I have the honor to invite you to be present at a meeting of our representative citizens at my office on the .... day of ......, 1895, at .... o'clock p. m., to consider matter relating to the coming session of the Transmississippi congress in this city.</p>
                            <p>At the last session of the congress Omaha, in competition with other enterprising cities, was chosen as the place for the next meeting of the congress, and, as the time is rapidly approaching for the session, it is important that we should take such action as will contribute to its success.</p>
                            <p>This congress is representative and vastly important, being composed of the best representation of the commercial interests of the vast section of country west of the Mississippi river.</p>
                            <p>Among the subjects that will be presented to the congress will be several in which our state and city are vitally interested, viz., beet sugar culture, irrigation, deep water harbors on the gulf and direct railway transportation to the same, that the great staples of this section of our country, wheat, corn, live stock, may find a direct and ready market through a southern outlet.</p>
                            <p>It is also contemplated in the near future to inaugurate and hold a great Transmississippi exposition, that the resources and importance of this great territory may be made known to the world.  This subject should command our deepest interest in the coming session of the congress, and Omaha should be well represented in the efforts to advance these great enterprises, so important to our future.</p>
                            <p>I trust you will appreciate the importance of this and be present at the meeting.  Very respectfully yours,</p>
                            <ab>............, Mayor.</ab>

                            <head type="sub">Nate Salsbury Gives His Ideas of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Nate Salsbury, manager of Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" was in the city yesterday for a few hours.  He was enroute to Sheridan, Wyo., where, in connection with Mr. Cody and a few others, he is interested in some large enterprises.</p>
                            <p>"I see you are just now preparing to give a great exposition here in Omaha," said Mr. Salsbury.  "I have seen all of the great expositions that have been held in recent years and if Omaha wishes to make a success of this one she has a vast amount of work to do.  It is not only a question of getting together a great exposition, but in getting the people to come and see it after it is ready to receive visitors.  The average hustling business man can be depended upon to get up the exposition, but to get at the people and convince them that they ought to come and see the show after it is organized is another thing.  To do this successfully requires some one who has made this a study and has made a success of it.  I firmly believe that had the World's fair management employed for this purpose some such man, for instance, as Bailey, the showman, it would have been several million dollars to the good.  They know from long experience how to reach the people and if they didn't they wouldn't last one season in the show business.</p>
                            <p>"It is important in such an enterprise that the attendance should be large from the very first day the gates are opened.  Then the first comers go home and spread the news in time for others, who might not have contemplated attending, to get ready and go."</p>
                            <p>Concerning the "Wild West" Mr. Salsbury stated the company was now showing at Quincy.  "We expect to make Omaha some time in August.  This will be the first appearance here since the show first started on the road."</p>

                            <p>Chancellor MacLean of the State university writes that the faculty of the university writes that the faculty of the university will use its best endeavors to secure the meeting of the National Educational association for Omaha during exposition year.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting of the general faculty of the University of Nebraska, held June 16, 1896, the following preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The bill providing for the Transmississippi exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 has become a law; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Such an exposition is of interest to every citizen of Nebraska and adjacent states; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Such an exposition is not only a great commercial and industrial, but also a great educational enterprise; therefore,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the faculty of the University of Nebraska offers the co-operation of the university, so far as it lies within its province, with the authorities conducting the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we are in favor of an exhibit by the university at the exposition, and that our professors shall render any service within their power.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, further, That it would seem desirable to have the university buildings opened as headquarters for the meeting of educational societies, and we recommend the regents to order that they be so opened.</p>
                            <p>Prof. R. B. Owens of the department of electrical and steam engineering of the university, will likely be an applicant for the superintendency of the electrical department of the exposition.  He was connected with that department at the World's fair.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">HOW THE EXPOSITION ORIGINATED.</hi></head>
                            <p>The Bee cheerfully gives space to a letter from Mr. R. W. Richardson relating to the origin of the Transmississippi exposition.  While according to Mr. Richardson due credit for bringing the Transmississippi congress to Omaha and exerting his influence with the representatives of this and other states to have the project of a Transmississippi exposition endorsed, we do not think his statement detracts anything from the claim that the inception of the exposition came from The Bee and its editor.</p>
                            <p>The original idea of holding an interstate exposition at Omaha was presented and advocated by The Bee years ago when the state fair was removed from Omaha.  Incidental to the interstate project was the establishment of a permanent exposition of products of the transmississippi country.  This idea had been repeatedly advanced and the erection of a permanent fireproof exposition building in the heart of the city urged from time to time.  Within the past two years conferences were had with members of the Board of County Commissioners and the detailed plan and purpose of such a building discussed with a view to its erection on county grounds.  The first definite suggestion of the proposed Transmississippi exposition was formulated by the editor of The Bee some weeks previous to the session of the Northwest State Immigration convention at St. Paul.  Minneapolis and St. Paul papers were at that time calling for action looking toward a mid-continent exposition at the Twin cities.  It was deemed important that Omaha should either compete at the convention for this enterprise or endeavor to anticipate the appeal for congressional recognition by securing an endorsement from the then coming Transmississippi congress.  This idea was communicated to Mayor Bemis and prominent members of the Commercial club who were enlisted in the state fair work.  At the outset the project met with a somewhat cold reception.  But by the time the congress assembled in Omaha enough favorable sentiment had been aroused to warrant the Omaha delegation in asking the congress to memorialize congress in behalf of an exposition in this city in 1898.</p>
                            <p>The reference to the exposition in the invitation issued by Mayor Bemis for Mr. Richardson was therefore in consonance with the idea previously advanced and discussed.  In fact, the invitation circular merely intimated that a Transmississippi exposition was contemplated at some indefinite time and at some indefinite place to be later determined.  The first public plea for an 1898 Transmississippi exposition at Omaha was that contained in the editorial in The Sunday Bee, November 25, 1895, the day before the assembling of the congress and before its members had any thought that such a project was to be brought up for its consideration.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEBRASKA AT THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>The Falls City Journal directs attention to the Trans-Mississippi exposition in a practical and effective way.  The Journal calls upon the people of Richardson to prepare for a representation of those things that will advertise Nebraska to the best advantage.  The Journal says:</p>
                            <p>How many people in Nebraska realize the meaning of "the exposition" as the term will be used for the next two or three years in all western states?</p>
                            <p>It means a miniature World's fair in Omaha and a combination of all the attractions of the New Orleans exposition the Midwinter fair of California and the Cotton States exposition in Atlanta.</p>
                            <p>"The west" is to have an opportunity of showing the world its wonderful products and almost illimitable possibilities.</p>
                            <p>We are to have the honor of entertaining distinguished guests.  It is time we began to put our house in order.</p>
                            <p>The principal city of Nebraska, one of the most important commercial centers of the Missouri valley, has been selected as the site of the fair.</p>
                            <p>Omaha and Nebraska should at once take steps to make it the success it should be.</p>
                            <p>Every citizen of Nebraska has a duty to perform.  To every citizen of Richardson county the Journal makes an especial appeal.</p>
                            <p>Richardson county, one of the oldest in the state and blessed and favored in an especial manner, has never taken any pains to make <choice><sic>kown</sic><corr>known</corr></choice> her great natural advantages.</p>
                            <p>It is a good plan to utilize machinery that is ready at hand, and we suggest that in this and other counties the county fair associations take this matter in charge.</p>
                            <p>Let every citizen in this county keep in mind the fact that the exposition is to be held and also keep his eyes and ears open to discover something on his farm or in his neighborhood that is of interest, and when it is discovered communicate with the president of the county fair association.</p>
                            <p>By this means, and only be this, or some similar method, will Nebraska make such a showing as her wealth and resources demand.</p>
                            <p>This is a good suggestion and ought to be followed in every county in the state.  Nebraska must be represented at the exposition in a superb way entirely apart from its association as the site of the exposition itself.</p>

                            <p>The inevitable row over the location of the Trans-Mississippi exposition is beginning.  All big shows have this experience, and it will perhaps do no harm; but in the interests of harmony and a speedy settlement of the trouble the Journal would like to suggest the city of Ashland as an excellent compromise.  It is much more accessible than the state fair grounds.&#8212;Lincoln Journal.</p>
                            <p>We have failed to observe any "row."  There will be, perhaps, a lively competition, but the location will be determined solely on the merits of the various sites offered.</p>
                            <p>The Lincoln Journal ought to be big enough to forget its pique over the loss of the state fair and by putting its shoulder to the wheel help the big exposition and thus incidentally help itself and the town and state in which it is published.</p>

                            <p>Among other things, the ways and means committee has decided to recommend that a stock subscription of $500,000 be raised, and that the matter be placed in the hands of a committee of twenty-five.</p>
                            <p>This committee will be chosen at the meeting tonight.  In addition a number of other important questions will be presented.</p>

                            <p>When the big men of Omaha shall have entered their subscriptions for the exposition enterprise there can be no doubt of the success of popular subscriptions in this city and state.  Such means were employed in aid of the Centennial exposition and later in aid of the World's fair.  When the masses of Chicago were appealed to at a critical stage of Columbian exposition construction the response was immediate and generous.  It will be so in Omaha, for every man, woman and child is imbued with the idea that the success of the exposition will enhance realty values, create business, afford employment to idle men and bring money into the city and state for investment.  Any man is willing to invest $10 if he is certain to realize 100 per cent on the venture.</p>

                            <p>Central City Nonpareil: All Nebraska is interested in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Kearney Hub: The Transmississippi exposition is now an assured fact.  That's a big feather in the cap of Omaha, of Nebraska and the west.</p>

                            <p>Lexington Pioneer:  The Transmississippi and international exposition bill has passed both houses of congress and was signed by the president.  To Congressman Dave Mercer and Senator Allen belongs the credit of securing the passage of the bill.</p>

                            <p>Fullerton Journal:  The exposition bill was carried through congress at the last hour and Nebraska may feel extremely proud for the honor conferred.  The material benefits which will come later will be in nowise small.  They will help to dispel the effect of a year of drouth.</p>
                            <p>Fullerton News:  The Omaha exposition is now an assured fact, and it will prove of great benefit to the whole west, and Nebraska in particular.  Congressman Mercer did excellent work in securing the passage of the bill appropriating $200,000 government aid, notwithstanding the efforts of Kem to defeat it.</p>
                            <p>Niobrara Pioneer:  The Pioneer congratulates Omaha and its representative men for their great victory in finally getting the exposition bill through congress, carrying a $200,000 appropriation with it.  Kem delayed it for a day, and it <choice><sic>semed</sic><corr>seemed</corr></choice> as if it was impossible for its passage.  It would have failed but for the friendly aid of Speaker Reed.</p>
                            <p>Columbus Journal:  The Transmississippi exposition to be held at Omaha is now an assured thing.  President Cleveland having approved the bill providing government recognition and aid and appropriating $200,000 for a building and exhibit.  It will undoubtedly be a grand affair and a great advertisement for the whole western portion of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Blair Pilot:  The Omaha exposition bill passed both branches of congress and has already received the president's signature and become a law.  Its passage is due mostly to the untiring efforts of Congressman Dave Mercer, who put the bill through during the absence of the two kickers, Bailey and Kem.  His friends are very enthusiastic over the efforts put forth by Mercer in securing the passage of this bill.</p>
                            <p>Weeping Water Republican:  The bill appropriating $200,000 for a government building and display of the Transmississippi exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 has passed both houses of congress and was signed by the president.  This will be a great boon to Omaha, Nebraska and the western states.  Omaha has begun to feel the good effect already in the way of numerous new buildings and other improvements.</p>
                            <p>Chappell Register:  The great west as well as Omaha and Nebraska are to be congratulated upon the passage of the Transmississippi exposition bill, which provides for an exposition at Omaha for the display of the products of the west, legalized by the government; in fact, making it a national affair.  To Congressman Mercer is due the credit of its passage.  If it had not been for his untiring work the measure would never have become a law.</p>
                            <p>Seward Reporter:  The passage of the Transmississippi exposition bill in the closing hours of congress is a matter of the greatest importance to Nebraska and the whole west.  The bill had a hard time all along, and it was only by the most indomitable energy and perseverance that it was finally passed.  Congressman Mercer worked unceasingly for the bill and overcame difficulties that would have discouraged any less ardent man.  He had the active support of every member of the Nebraska delegation except Kem.  Toward the last, when hard work was necessary, Senator Allen did some wonderfully effective work for the measure.  The assurance of the exposition will be of great and immediate benefit, not only to Omaha and Nebraska, but to the whole west.  Work will be at once commenced, and before a great while the exposition project will take tangible shape.  It will doubtless be one of the most popular enterprises ever undertaken in the west.</p>
                            <p>Leigh World:  Omaha celebrates the passage of the Transmississippi bill Friday evening, June 26.  The passage of the bill is of great importance to Omaha, to Nebraska and to the west.  It gives the west an exposition, the benefits of which will be the most far-reaching in all sections of the west of anything that has yet been done.  It will focus public interest first in Omaha, then Nebraska and next the entire west.  It is high time the western portion of this great country was getting something in the way of direct legislation.</p>
                            <p>Alliance Times:  The Omaha exposition bill provides that the exposition shall be held in Omaha from June to November in 1898, in which twenty-four of the middle states will participate.  Many of these have already taken steps to assist.  The sum of $200,000 is appropriated and $250,000 will be subscribed.  The government will erect a building to contain exhibits costing about $50,000, and about $150,000 will be expended in preparing the government exhibit.  It will be a grand thing for the west, and credit for the passage of the bill is due to Congressman Mercer and Senator Allen.</p>
                            <p>Holdrege Citizen:  The Transmississippi exposition can be regarded as an assured fact.  The bill which Kem thought he killed has received the president's signature.  The entire west was interested in this movement.  Nebraska, as well as Omaha, can rejoice over the passage of the bill, for it means much in the material development of this country.   The congressmen from this state, with the exception of Kem, and our two senators, have done a valiant work for this measure and are deserving of the thanks of all of its citizens.  All loyal Nebraskans will now redouble their efforts in behalf of the great exposition of 1898.</p>
                            <p>Valparaiso Visitor:  The Transmississippi exposition to be held in Nebraska's metropolis in 1898 certainly means much for Nebraska as well as the entire western and middle states.  The great show will begin in June and last through October, during which time tens of thousands of people will visit our state for the first time and the people of Omaha and Nebraska will welcome them most heartily and make ample provisions for their entertainment and the products of the farm, factory and mine, the sciences, art, the literature and learning of the age, will be grandly and artistically exhibited.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska City Chief:  Omaha is drifting into an era of prosperity that is sure to place Nebraska's metropolis on an equal footing with the other large cities of the west, and indeed its chances are flattering for first place.  Now that the Transmississippi exposition for 1898 has received the necessary assistance from congress to insure its success, and with the state fair located there, there is not reason why Omaha should not come right to the front.  We rejoice with them in their many triumphs, for as Omaha prospers and partakes of the spirit of advancement, so will the country tributary thereto be reaping untold benefits.  Here's to the success of Omaha and may her people live long and prosper.</p>
                            <p>Ashland Gazette:  The great Transmississippi exposition of 1898 will mark a new era in the history of Nebraska.  It will not only give employment to our laboring men, but it will call the attention of the world to our splendid state as no other event has ever done.  Let us jubilate over the prospects of such an era of prosperity as we have never before witnessed.  And in the midst of our gratitude let us not forget to accord to Senators Thurston and Allen and to Congressmen Mercer, Hainer, Meiklejohn, Andrews and Strode, as well as to President Cleveland, the full measure of our gratitude for the great benefit they have conferred upon our beloved state of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Cambridge Kaleidoscope: The Transmississippi exposition bill, appropriating $200,000 for the purpose of an exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898, was passed during the closing hours of congress.  While this exposition is intended to benefit all of the western states and all are expected to participate, at the same time the city of Omaha and the state of Nebraska will be held responsible for results.  Omaha will test the interest of citizens in the enterprise by asking them to contribute $250,000, which will be cheerfully done.  It is to be hoped that every citizen of the state will be loyal to this undertaking and contribute to its success all that is within his power.  It should be made a magnificent display of western resources and enterprise and its benefits to the west in general and to Nebraska in particular should be many and permanent.</p>
                            <p>Tekamah Burtonian: The president signed the bill appropriating $200,000 toward the erection of buildings for the Transmississippi exposition at Omaha during the closing hours of congress.  The Omaha Bee claims the idea originated with it.  Whether this is true or not, it will be a great benefit to this section of the country.  The success of the bill is in a great measure due to the efforts of Congressman Mercer and Senator Allen, who forced it through only by the most persistent hard work.  In recognition of the efforts of Senator Allen, the citizens of Omaha propose, without regard to party, to give him a grand reception whenever he will designate he can attend, in appreciation of his efforts.</p>
                            <p>Beatric Democrat:  The Transmississippi exposition to be held in Omaha two years hence is an institution that will need and should receive the support and patronage of every person interested in the prosperity of the west.  It will advertise our resources in a way that they were never advertised before.  It will forever set at rest the damaging reports regarding our crop failures and the business depression that hung over us during the past two years.  It will clearly demonstrate the recuperative resources of our state, and will give people a confidence in our soil, climate, and the energy of our people that will be worth untold millions in the future of the state.  Let everybody push the great exposition along.</p>
                            <p>Randolph Reporter: All good people everywhere, and of the west particularly, and most especially of Nebraska, will rejoice that the Omaha exposition bill has passed congress and received the signature of the president, and that the exposition is now an assured fact, in spite of the opposition of Kem.  Credit is due <choice><sic>Co)ngressman</sic><corr>Congressman</corr></choice> Mercer in the house and Senator Allen in the senate for hard work in its behalf, but to neither of these is greater credit due than to the president of the exposition, G. W. Wattles of Omaha, who has been tireless in his efforts in behalf of the exposition.  Under his direction and supervision the exposition is bound to be a grand success and of incalculable benefit to Nebraska and the west generally.</p>
                            <p>Tilden Citizen:  The Transmississippi and International exposition bill, which appropriates $200,000 for erecting a building and making a government exhibit at Omaha, passed both houses of congress and received the signature of President Cleveland all in the short space of five hours.  This makes the big show at Omaha in 1898 an assured fact and the work in preparation for the event will soon be commenced.  Secretary Wakefield of the company says that they will raise $1,000,000 and make it the greatest exposition ever held in this country, outside of the World's fair.  Omaha and Nebraska are to be congratulated on the result of their efforts, as it will mean a season of great prosperity from this time on.</p>
                            <p>York Times:  All Nebraska and all the transmississippi country, except Omar Kem, are united in favor of the great exposition at Omaha and feel truly grateful to every one who assisted in getting the bill through congress that made it passable, and in securing the president's signature to the same.  Congressman Mercer led the fight and it was the fight of his life.  He is a strong, able man and a tireless worker.  Congressman Hainer gave the bill the full benefit of his great popularity and influence and seconded Mr. Mercer in every way possible.  Meiklejohn and Andrews were active and earnest, though the former was in Nebraska during the most of the hard fight.  Kem did all he could in his puny way to retard the passage of the bill and defeat it.  By so doing he made himself even more despised by everybody, but fortunately he was neither smart nor strong enough to do much harm.  In the senate Allen put his broad shoulder to the wheel and gave the bill his most earnest and cordial support.  By so doing he won the gratitude and esteem of all loyal Nebraskans.  He was strong enough to win a brilliant victory, and in half an hour after the bill passed the house the amendment had been concurred in by the senate.  Other distinguished Nebraskans also gave valuable assistance, among them Hon. E. Rosewater and ex-Senator Paddock.</p>
                            <p>Winside Tribune:  The Transmississippi exposition being an assured success, in spite of the "combined opposition of Mr. Kem," it behooves the people of Nebraska to take care that no opportunity for booming the exposition should be allowed to pass by.  When you write to your friends in the east speak of it; when you are talking to your acquaintances talk of the exposition.  It will be an event in the history of Nebraska and the west, second only in importance to the World's fair at Chicago.  It will bring our
                            
                            <pb n="185" xml:id="TMISB01-185"/>
                            
                            state into the notice of the eastern people, who think of this country as the great American desert.  It will set them to talking of use, investing money with us.  It will be the great means of establishing ourselves in the confidence of those whose confidence is lost.  It is, first and foremost, a business enterprise, an enterprise which will bring returns in dollars and cents for the money invested.  Besides the business character of the exposition it is a great educational scheme which will be valuable to those people of the transmississippi region who are desirous of knowing about each other, of knowing about the resources of this great west.  "Know thyself" applies to communities as well as to individuals.  In attending the great exposition in 1898 we shall have an opportunity to learn of ourselves and our neighbors.  The Tribune ventures to predict that there is a remarkably small number who will not be surprised at the great quantity of things concerning even our own state which they do not know.  Boom the great event of the closing of the nineteenth century&#8212;the Transmississippi exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Meeting of Citizens to Hear Exposition Committee's Report Is Enthusiastic.</head>
                            <head type="sub">The Recommendations Made Are Unanimously Carried Into Effect by Those Present.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Directors Will Ratify the Appointment of a Finance Committee Today&#8212;Half a Million Stock on the Market.</head>
                            <p>The Commercial club was packed last night with a body of representative citizens to listen to the report of the Trans-Mississippi exposition ways and means committee.  The report was made by George W. Lininger, chairman, and provided for the raising by subscription and issuance of stock by the corporation the amount of $500,000.  It also recommended the appointment of a committee of twenty-five, of which Herman Kountze is chairman, whose names were published in the Sunday World-Herald, as a committee on finance.  The report was unanimously adopted.  The directors of the exposition meet today at the Commercial club to ratify the action of the business men's meeting, and a meeting of the finance committee will be called Wednesday at 3 o'clock p. m.</p>
                            <p>In announcing the report, Mr. Lininger said that the finance committee was intended to localize the corporation, and the people of the state would be given the privilege of taking stock, as well as any others who chose to do so.  In response to a question by W. B. Taylor as to what objections had been raised in the committee meeting as to the issuing of city and county bonds, Mr. Lininger stated that the bonds could not be voted until after the legislature provided for some changes in the charter.  It was necessary to raise an amount of ready money, and the company would merely follow the example of the World's fair and other corporations in so doing.  President Wattles explained that before the provisions of the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill become operative, and the president can issue to this and foreign nations the proclamation that the Trans-Mississippi exposition will be held in Omaha, $250,000 of stock must be subscribed.</p>
                            <p>In answer to questions by Colonel Champion S. Chase, Mr. Lininger stated the report and resolution accompanying it did not contemplate the organization of a new corporation; the present corporation, organized several months ago, had authority to issue stock to the amount of $1,000,000, and while it was proposed that the finance committee provided for in the report should solicit and collect subscriptions, and do the financiering of the exposition, it was not proposed to form a new corporation.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles also answered a number of questions.  He assured Mr. Richardson that the committee on ways and means in recommending that $500,000 in subscriptions be raised did not mean to limit the amount of subscriptions to that figure; it was to be the least amount.  It would, he said, be much better if the full $1,000,000 could be subscribed, on account of the moral effect it would have in furthering other subscriptions.  In reply to a question by Councilman Saunders, Mr. Wattles stated that the by-laws provided for the annual meeting of stockholders in January, and while they did not state the term for which the original officers were elected the electing of a new directory, if one were desired, would naturally be part of the business of the stockholders' meeting.</p>
                            <p>While not so many enthusiastic speeches were made as at the meeting Friday night, the meeting being simply a business one, there was an air of confidence and even of enthusiasm about the whole meeting, and also in the conversations before and after it.  There was not a whisper of doubt to be heard anywhere, but on the contrary the exposition was always spoken of as an assured fact.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Local Workers Enthusiastic Over Securing the Convention in 1898.</head>
                            <p>There was a largely attended meeting of those interested in the bringing of the Christian Endeavor convention in 1898 to Omaha held at the Commercial club rooms last evening.  Arthur Chase, president of the city union, presided, and addresses were made by President Wattles of the exposition directory, A. P. Tukey, G. G. Wallace, Rev. S. Wright Butler, Rev. Turkle, Dr. A. B. Somers, J. Burns and others.  The meeting was a very enthusiastic one and a resolution was carried unanimously to extend an invitation to the society to meet in Omaha in exposition year.  The chair was authorized to appoint a committee to go to Washington at the annual meeting of the society and present the invitation of this city.  The committee was not appointed at this time because it was thought best to look around and find the best men available for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>It was announced during the meeting that letters had been received from the executive board of the organization stating that Omaha was looked upon with favor on account of its central location, and that the big convention could very likely be secured if this city could make a sufficient showing that it could care for the immense crowds that attend, and in addition provide the means for paying the expense attending the meeting, which would require about $25,000.  The usual attendance upon these conventions runs from 75,000 to 100,000 and with the added attraction of a great exposition it would be likely to exceed rather than fall below that figure in 1898.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Omaha Christian Endeavorers Want the National Convention.</head>
                            <p>Omaha wants the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor national convention with its 75,000 delegates in July, 1898, and it wants it badly, so the mass meeting of Endeavorers and business men at the Commercial club rooms last evening unanimously decided, and then it further decided to go after that convention with a vim and energy that would capture it.</p>
                            <p>It was an adjourned meeting from last Thursday evening, and Alfred Chase presided.  Ringing addresses with the "Stand up for Omaha" brand upon them were made by Gurdon W. Wattles, G. H. Payne, A. P. Tukey, G. G. Wallace, Dr. S. Wright Butler, Rev. A. J. Turkle, Rev. S. M. Ware, Dr. A. B. Somers, Dr. F. E. Coulter, Jay Burns and others.</p>
                            <p>Then the chairman was directed to appoint a committee of five to head the delegation of 150 that will leave this city for the national convention at Washington in July, and which will be authorized to guarantee accommodations for 75,000 or more visitors, and $25,000 in cash.  The international committee, which will decide the location on July 8, or shortly after, is known to be already favorable to Omaha, all promises being equal.</p>
                            <p>The location of the national convention is decided two years in advance, the one last year being at Boston, this year at Washington, next year at San Francisco, and in 1898, with the high hopes founded on the enthusiastic Endeavorers of Omaha, Council Bluffs and South Omaha, and the offer which they are prepared to make, it is confidently believed that it will meet in Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LET US CELEBRATE.</head>
                            <p>Let us celebrate Friday night in such a manner that it will be one of the notable events in the history of the west.  The location of the Trans-Mississippi exposition is now assured, and Omaha appreciates the high honor of being the point selected for the great display of this grand region which is to exceed in splendor anything that has been attempted in this western half of the continent.</p>
                            <p>It is probably the last of its kind that will receive the recognition of this government and other nations of this earth, and this recognition has been given in deference to the region west of the great river known as the trans-Mississippi states and territories.</p>
                            <p>As a trans-Mississippi event let us celebrate it as trans-Mississippians, and not as the citizens of any one city or state.</p>
                            <p>Let surrounding cities join hands with Omaha in spirit and in person, and let Omaha make their citizens who can be present most welcome to our midst.</p>
                            <p>In no sense is the exposition to be a local or a state affair, nor must it be.  Every state and territory of our common country must be made to feel an interest in the exposition.  We must secure an identity of interest for each, and more particularly from the Mississippi to the Pacific every man must feel that the success of the exposition is to be for the glory and growth of the commonwealth in which he lives.</p>
                            <p>The prospects are bright for the exposition's success, and Omaha must lead in the celebration of its location.</p>

                            <p>The war over the location of the exposition is already filling the heavens with smoke.

South Omaha is boiling over with interest in the matter naturally, and will make a mighty windy effort to have the site fastened within hailing distance of the city.  There is considerable fear that the show will go to the fair grounds, due to the fact that the men who secured the selection of Omaha as the place for the exposition are the heaviest stockholders in the race track association.

                            <p>When the exposition people get ready to go into the detail work of preparing for the big show South Omaha should gird up her bloomers and fall upon them with a request for the appointment of Mr. Sigmund Landsberg as director general of music.  Such an office was found to be of great importance at the world's fair, and is sure to be a part of the managerial element of the coming transmississippi affair.  No one can question the ability of Mr. Landsberg to brilliantly perform the duties of such an office.  He is adept in musical lore, a skilled musician, and a worshipper at the alter of the <choice><sic>goodess</sic><corr>goddess</corr></choice> of melody who is soon destined to be a world-famed artist.  He enjoys a large acquaintanceship in musician circles, which is most successful directorship and as he is in love with his cult he would be sure to make that feature of the exposition a particularly enjoyable one.  South Omaha would not ask the appointment because of what pecuniary <choice><sic>emmoluments</sic><corr>emoluments</corr></choice> there may be in the position but because it believes it can thereby materially add to the enjoyment of the occasion and at the same moment show that the transmississippi region can produce artistic talent as well as agricultural and industrial wealth.</p>

                            <p>The east has been taking advantage of the sentiment and patriotism of the west for many years, and filling its pockets with western earnings the while.  Some western states now seem disposed to protest against a continuation of this arrangement.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee Appointed to See What Exposition Directors Have Done.</head>
                            <p>The bureau of finance in connection with the Trans-Mississippi exposition met at the Commercial club yesterday afternoon to perfect organization and plan for its work.  At the outset H. W. Yates introduced a resolution calling for the appointment of a committee by the chairman, Mr. Kountze, to compare the articles of incorporation of the association with those of similar organizations, and investigate the work done to the present time.  He thought this step was necessary before anything else was undertaken, to see if the power of the bureau was such as to warrant the members in accepting the positions they had been called upon to fill.</p>
                            <p>This resolution called forth considerable discussion and there was much feeling manifested between some members of the bureau and the friends of the present board of directors.</p>
                            <p>The resolution prevailed, when put to a vote, and the following committee was appointed, with instructions to report at the earliest possible opportunity: Herman Kountze, chairman; W. S. Poppleton, Guy C. Barton, F. P. Kirkendall, J. H. Millard, H. W. Yates and C. E. Yost.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater, who is a member of the bureau, moved that reporters be excluded from all future meetings of the bureau, and it was adopted by the meeting.</p>

                            <p>The committee of the Commercial club again requests that all societies and organizations which intend to take part in the parade will notify the club at once, in order that plans for the parade can be perfected.  All the organizations in the city are invited to take part in it, and according to the committee, everything in the line of fireworks, transparencies, floats and bands goes.  The idea is to make is distinctively a parade of the people.</p>
                            <p>As yet the labor organizations of Omaha have not responded to the invitation of the Commercial club requesting them to join in the big parade which is to take place next Friday night, in celebration of the securing of the Transmississippi exposition.</p>
                            <p>George N. Hicks, in speaking of the matter yesterday, stated the members of the club were somewhat anxious to know what action was to be taken with reference to the parade.  He thought that no body of men would evince greater interest in the matter than those representing organized labor, and expressed himself as desirous of seeing an immense turnout of unions in this town.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi exposition jubilee-parade and celebration this evening will be the greatest civic demonstration ever held in the city.</p>
                            <p>This condition is made possible, notwithstanding the short time given to arrangements and preparations, through the spontaneous manner in which the citizens and organizations of all kinds in Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs have come forward.  A large number of responses, both from individuals outside the city, and from organizations of the three cities, have been received to the invitations sent out from the Commercial club.  Organizations which have not yet formally notified Chief Marshal Wilcox, care the Commercial club, are requested to do so at once and they will be assigned places in the parade.</p>
                            <p>The parade will be divided into three divisions.  In addition there will be a special military division, under command of Colonel Bates, U. S. A., in the lead.  It will be composed of the Second Infantry, U. S. A., and band, the Thurston Rifles, Dodge Light Guards of Council Bluffs, Omaha Guards and High school cadets.</p>
                            <p>Major R. S. Wilcox will be chief marshal of the parade, with Dudley Smith, C. Hartman and J. L. Paxton of South Omaha as assistant marshals of the different divisions.</p>
                            <p>The first division will be composed of the Trans-Mississippi and Commercial club officials, city and council officials, distinguished visitors in carriages, the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben and the Grand Army of the Republic posts.</p>
                            <p>The second division, led by the Ancient Order of United Workmen band, will be composed of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Modern Woodmen, Woodmen of the World, Bricklayers' union, Red Men and other secret and labor organizations.</p>
                            <p>The third division will be made up principally of South Omaha, and promises to be a very interesting one.  Colonel A. L. Lott will be in command of a body of horsemen.  The Independent Order of Odd Fellow lodges and their band will be in this division.  The bicyclists will form a division of their own.</p>
                            <p>The committee hopes that all the organizations will make a good showing in the way of fireworks, transparencies, banners and flags.  It is proposed that the bicyclists carry lanterns and have their wheels ornamented.</p>
                            <p>The High school cadets will meet at the school at 7 o'clock this evening, and march to the position assigned them.</p>

C. Newsom, editor North Bend Republican; C. R. Schaeffer, publisher Platte River Zeitung, Fremont; A. H. Sniff, Harrison County News, Missouri Valley, Ia.; C. H. Judson, secretary Council Bluffs Business Men's association; John A. Gutsche, mayor, Plattsmouth; John Du Shane, mayor, Malvern, Ia.; R. E. Pate, Pender, Neb.</p>
                            <p>Letters of regret at their inability to be present and expressing best wishes for the success of the exposition were received from Senator Gear and Congressmen Henderson, Lacey, Updegraff, Clark, Cousins and Perkins of Iowa; Governor Sheldon of South Dakota, and a number of prominent men from Nebraska and neighboring states.  All letters were very cordial in their predictions of the success of the exposition and the great benefit it would be to the entire west.</p>

                            <p>A city councilman suggested last night that it would not be necessary for carriages to be furnished the city fathers.  He thought it would be better if they should walk just like common people.</p>

                            <p>I, T. H. Ensor, mayor of the city of South Omaha, do hereby earnestly request all merchants and business men of this city to close their places of business on June 26, 1896, at 6 o'clock p. m., for the purpose of attending the jubilee inauguration of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, which is to be held in the city of Omaha at the above date.  The city council, board of trade, Municipal league and nearly all the civic and military associations of our city are taking a great interest in this event and propose to show our sister city on the north that they cannot have a successful demonstration of this kind without our assistance.  I believe it is safe to say that South Omaha will have in line at the procession 1,500 to 2,000 citizens.  By making a demonstration of this magnitude it will place us in a position to have considerable say as to where the exposition shall  be located, which is of vital importance to the business interests of this city.  I trust that this section of this country has ever est in this greatest movement, which is destined to do the greatest amount of good that this section of the country has ever known will not be neglected, and that every one will take more than a common interest in this event.</p>

                            <p>A meeting of business men and other citizens was held last evening at the city building, at the call of the Council Bluffs committeemen of the Trans-Mississippi congress, for the purpose of making arrangements to participate in the big demonstration and ratification meeting in Omaha this evening.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Carson was chosen chairman and C. H. Judson secretary.  George F. Wright, the Iowa committeeman, with whom Secretary Utt has been corresponding relative to the coming of Council Bluffs to Omaha on this occasion, stated that it would be necessary for him to know by this morning who and how many approximately will go from this city.  "Utt is sitting up nights," said he, "trying to find out who are coming from this side of the river to join in the feast, so that he may give us the best seats."  Mayor Carson said he had sent the formal acceptance of the mayor and council and city officers.  Wright said the secret orders, to all of whom invitations were extended by Mr. Utt, has asked that the invitations come through their respective orders in Omaha.  This arrangement had been made, and it was supposed that the orders here would participate.</p>
                            <p>Inasmuch as he wanted to know this morning who will go, the following were appointed to secure information regarding the intentions of the organizations named and report the result to Mr. Wright:  Dodge Light guards, John Templeton; Odd Fellows and Modern Woodmen of America, John Gilbert; High School cadets, Wal McFadden; Knights of Pythias, C. S. Byers.</p>
                            <p>No others were present who could conveniently see other organizations, and upon motion, the secretary drafted the following invitation:</p>
                            <p>Notice to All Citizens:  In pursuance of a resolution of a mass meeting of business men of Council Bluffs, held at the council chamber, Thursday evening, June 25, an invitation is hereby extended to all citizens, secret orders, military and civic organizations, and all societies, to attend the Trans-Mississippi inauguration jubilee in Omaha this evening; and all societies and organizations are requested to report to Hon. George F. Wright this morning the probable number who will attend.  Everyone is urgently requested to join in this jubilee and to take part in the parade which occurs in Omaha between 7 and 9 o'clock tonight.  Take motors not later than 6:30 o'clock.</p>
                            <ab>GEORGE CARSON, Chairman.</ab>

                            <p>Mr. Wright read a telegram he received yesterday from Mr. Utt, asking that a speaker be selected to represent Council Bluffs in the jubilee tonight.  A committee, consisting of Messrs. Wright, Casper and Dr. Thomas, was appointed to select the man to speak for this city and later reported John N. Baldwin, who will be the orator from this side of the river.</p>
                            <p>On motion, the following committee of sixteen was appointed to select a committee of twenty-five and report the same to an adjournment of last night's meeting, held next Tuesday evening at the same place:  A. S. Hazelton, chairman; C. S. Byers, Charles Beno, S. S. Keller, D. W. Bushnell, C. H. Judson, M. F. Rohrer, E. W. Hart, I. M. Treynor, E. H. Merriam, Lucius Wells, J. R. Bell, William Morre, N. M. Pusey, C. R. Hannan, George F. Wright.  This committee will meet at the city council chamber at 9 o'clock, Saturday morning, for the purpose of making the selection of the committee of twenty-five, and the latter committee, when finally approved by the meeting Tuesday evening, will have entire charge of all business in Council Bluffs connected with the Trans-Mississippi exposition from now until the end.</p>
                            <p>Pending the selection of the committee of sixteen, Messrs. Hazelton and Wright spoke briefly.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Casper and Wright were appointed a committee to look after the transportation of the Council Bluffs delegation, and Colonel D. B. Daily was selected as marshal, to have charge of those going from here, with power to appoint aides.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Omaha's Serious Task.</head>
                            <l>Denver Republican.</l>
                            <p>Omaha is determined to go ahead with its plan to hold an exposition representing the Transmississippi region.  No other town objects and all will help if the exposition is held.  But in starting upon this venture Omaha undertakes a very serious task.  It is no light thing to prepare for and then hold a great exposition, and the results are often disappointing.</p>
                        </div2>
                        <div2 type="article">
                            <head type="sub">MERCER'S MASTER STROKE.</head>
                            <p>Friend Telegraph:  There ought to be nothing too good for Dave Mercer in Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Central City Nonpareil:  To no man are the citizens of Omaha more indebted for the success of their exposition than to Dave Mercer, and a failure to return him to congress would show base ingratitude.</p>
                            <p>Winside Tribune:  "Bill is passed, kiss the baby," telegraphed Congressman Mercer to his wife on the day of the passage of the exposition bill, which was also the anniversary of his marriage.  Dave Mercer is a man who represents Nebraska by representing Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Blair Pilot:  Congressman Mercer is deserving of no small amount of credit for the efforts he has put forth in the interests of the Omaha exposition bill.  He has found it rather up-hill business pushing the bill, but "Our Dave" is a stayer when the interests of the people of his district are at stake, and he promises to stay with this bill until it is passed.  Small stumbling blocks like Kem and Bailey of Texas will easily be removed by Dave Mercer when he puts his shoulder to the wheel.</p>
                            <p>Gretna Reporter:  Kennedy, the Omaha aspirant for congressional honors to succeed Congressman Mercer, is now trying to make buncombe out of the recent triumph of Dave Mercer in securing the passage of the exposition bill.  His recent utterances to the effect that Mercer had a pull with the house, the speaker, the senate and the president, and that the bill had been willfully delayed by Mercer for political reasons, is pure political bias and will not redound to Kennedy's success at the coming convention.  More than that, if Mercer has such a pull with the legislative and executive departments as indicated he should need no further recommendation.  If we have such a man as that in congress we should by all means keep him there, and such statements as Kennedy's will do more to accomplish that end than any amount of favorable mention by him, as it clearly demonstrates his incompetency for the position he aspires to.  Kennedy had better follow the example of Andrews&#8212;by withdrawing from the race before it is too late.</p>

                            <p>The Omaha Retailers' association last night combined business with pleasure at its regular meeting.  In accordance with a resolution passed at the last meeting a very nice little banquet was enjoyed, which was enlivened with the strains of a mandolin and guitar quartet.  While the hundred or more members and invited guests were not eating they talked exposition enthusiastically.</p>
                            <p>Immediately after the feasting was concluded and cigars were passed, Chairman Hospe opened the flood of talk by summoning Secretary C. D. Thompson of the association.  Mr. Thompson devoted his talk to a history of the association and then followed this up by predicting that it would have considerably to do with the ultimate success of the big exposition.  He said that the association had been formed but six months ago, but that already it had 500 of the retailers of the city upon its roll.  He mentioned the victory that had been obtained in the insurance fight and predicted a victory in the depot case in the near future.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Dave Mercer was the honored guest of the occasion and upon him Chairman Hospe called next.  "If we send him back to congress," said Mr. Hospe, "he will get $300,000 more for us."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer began by saying that when he left Omaha last year everybody was grumbling over hard times, but that since his return he found smiling faces and a feeling of hope.  This hopefulness, he said, had a good deal to do with the final passage of the bill, because it found expression in petitions which flooded congressmen from every portion of the country.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">STRUGGLES OF THE BILL.</head>
                            <p>The congressman devoted a large portion of his remarks to a description of the struggle through which the bill passed during its life in the congressional body.  He spoke of the "specter" that appeared in the persons of Kem, Bailey of Texas and other anti-exposition congressmen and who threatened the life of the bill to the last hour.  He mentioned the innocent maneuvers by which these men had been disposed of and the manner in which the bill was finally passed under suspension of the rules.  All this matter is already public property.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer then mentioned a conversation he had with President Cleveland regarding the exposition.  The president expressed himself to the effect that it would be a better and grander exposition from Omaha's situation than any other, excepting the Chicago exposition, that has ever been held.  He stated that the west was little understood by the east and south and the exposition would offer this section the greatest opportunity it ever had to exhibit its resources to the eastern and southern sections.  He stated further that it would attract dormant and idle capital and would thus assist in immeasurably building up Omaha, Nebraska and the entire west.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer stated further that Omaha was held in high opinion by eastern financiers.  It had the best reputation of any western city in New York financial circles and consequently its bonds were always above par.  This reputation, as stated by one financier, was due to the fact that Omaha "had never boomed itself to death."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OMAHA MUST DO ITS SHARE.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer felt confident that a greater appropriation would ultimately be obtained from the government.  He laid great stress upon the sending of a good delegation from this county to the state legislature to get a handsome appropriation.  If such was obtained, he said, it would greatly influence the government in increasing its appropriation and in persuading the western states to make handsome exhibits.  He was particular to state that the greatest burden of the exposition must rest upon Omaha, but found recompense in the fact that immense capital would be attracted to the city, state and the west.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield of the Transmississippi directory made a long address upon the exposition.  He was very sanguine regarding the benefit that would accrue to the city and the entire west, and was equally sanguine of the success of the exposition.  He was confident that the $500,000 needed would be raised without difficulty.</p>
                            <p>Captain Palmer spoke briefly to refute the claims of Frank Ransom, the champion of the valued policy law, who spoke at the last meeting.  He denied that the bill had been passed by lawyer legislators, who had been engaged in the insurance business, or that the insurance companies had used unfair methods in opposing the bill.  He declared the bill had been passed to "punish insurance companies."</p>
                            <p>T. W. Blackburn was to have spoken on better collection laws, but owing to the lateness of the hour the address was postponed to a future meeting.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Finance Committee of the Exposition Held a Meeting Yesterday.</head>
                            <p>The bureau of finance of the Transmississippi Exposition association met for the first time at the Commercial club yesterday afternoon.  No definite steps were take toward the object for which the bureau was created.  The only conclusion reached was that a committee should be appointed to examine the articles of incorporation of this and other exposition associations and recommend any changes that in their judgment would operate to broaden and popularize the exposition.  This resolution was adopted on the vigorous recommendation of Messrs. Yates, Kountze, and others, who contended that it was essential that the bureau should know exactly what position it occupied in regard to the board of directors before it proceeded further.  It was also expressed as the sense of the committee that the plan of the directory to send a committee to the Louisiana legislature should be carried out without waiting for further action on the part of the bureau of finance.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has decided to appoint the committee to proceed to Louisiana.  Two of the members are ex-Governor Furnas, who represented Nebraska at the New Orleans exposition, and Dr. George L. Miller, who has many friends in the south.</p>
                            <p>E. Rosewater moved that in the future reporters be excluded from the meetings of <choice><sic>thethe</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> usually lasted several hours and that little was accomplished that was of public interest, consequently it was time wasted for newspaper reporters to sit around for hours, listening to debate.  He added that when the bureau got down to work, then he was willing to throw open the doors and have the proceedings given the greatest amount of publicity.  The motion prevailed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION DIRECTORS MEET.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Some Advertising Matter is Presented for Consideration.</head>
                            <p>Congressman Mercer and Judge Wright, Iowa's vice president for the exposition, lunched with the directors of the Transmississippi exposition this noon.  In response to a question by President Wattles, Judge Wright said that the people of Council Bluffs were very well satisfied with the personnel of the finance committee, and that they were willing to do all in their power to make the exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>Members of the committee appointed to investigate the capabilities of H. B. Hardt, reported that they found him a man of wide experience in connection with expositions.  They said that he had been connected with all the greatest expositions that have been held during the past twenty-two years and that they considered his experience and judgment valuable to the Transmississippi exposition.  His application was laid over with a recommendation for favorable action, until that head of business should be reached.</p>
                            <p>Several samples of advertising that make mention of the exposition were exhibited.  An envelope with the map of the United States, representing Omaha as the hub of an immense wheel, attracted much attention.  Another clever bit of advertising shown was the pamphlet of a local trust company.  The small paster put out by a local play house, advising theatrical managers to book their greatest attractions for Omaha in 1898, was criticised for its inaccurate statement of facts concerning the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A letter from R. B. Owens of the University of Nebraska, suggesting that some effort be made to secure the convention of electrical societies here at the time of the exposition, was read.  It was resolved to extend a formal invitation to such societies through Mr. Owens.</p>
                            <p>On the invitation of President Wattles the directory then adjourned to Hospe's music room to listen to a march which the composer desired to dedicate to the exposition.  The march is a fascinating bit of music.  Like most martial airs it is as well adapted for a deux temps dance as for a march.  It was composed and played by Miss Irene Williams, a talented musician of Missouri Valley.  After hearing it the directors expressed their approval and asked that the secretary be furnished with a copy.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The arrangements for the big parade and attendant festivities with which the passage of the exposition bill will be formally celebrated this evening are practically complete.  Nearly every hour has brought new features to add to the spectacular attractions and a jubilation of mammoth proportions is assured.  One of the biggest and most interesting parades that ever marched through the streets of the city will start promptly as 8 o'clock.  There will be music and fireworks galore and the show will compare favorably with even the great pageants of the last Ak-Sar-Ben festival.</p>
                            <p>The <choice><sic>manager's</sic><corr>managers</corr></choice> of Pain's "Last Days of Pompeii" have agreed to join in the parade with their big spectacular floats and contribute some magnificent fireworks to the general effect.  Besides the organizations that were assigned to places in the parade yesterday, several others have signified their intention to participate and they will be assigned to places by the marshals tonight.  The Typographical union will be out in force.  The Horseshoers' union, the Letter Carriers' union and numerous other labor organizations will also add their numbers to those previously announced.  The Omaha Elks would have appeared in line in dress suits and silk hats, but it was found that nearly all of them were included in the Ak-Sar-Ben organization, so they concluded to let it go at that.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">SPEECHES AT JEFFERSON SQUARE.</head>
                            <p>The platform has been erected at the south side of Jefferson square.  It will accommodate about 300 people.  President Charles F. Weller of the Commercial club will preside at the meeting and short speeches will be delivered by Senator W. V. Allen, Congressman D. H. Mercer, G. W. Wattles, Robert Furnas, Congressman G. D. Meiklejohn, General Charles F. Manderson, Senator John M. Thurston, Judge John N. Baldwin of Council Bluffs and Mayor T. H. Ensor of South Omaha.  The managers wish to distinctly impress the speakers with the idea that their efforts be limited to five or ten-minute talks.  This is done in order that each of the speakers mentioned may be heard.  As the parade will not move before 8 o'clock, it is likely to be nearly 10 before the speaking begins and unless the addresses are very brief some of the last speakers would be at a disadvantage.</p>
                            <p>South Omaha is showing a gratifying degree of enthusiasm in everything that pertains to the exposition and the South Omaha division of the parade is expected to do credit to that hustling city.  The officers of the various wheel clubs have taken a lively interest and a great turnout of wheelmen is promised.  Notices have been sent to each of the members of the various Turnverein organizations and the Turners in their neat gray uniforms <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> be a big feature of the procession.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">ALONG THE LINE OF MARCH.</head>
                            <p>While there has been no time to agitate the matter of decorations, a number of the local business houses are preparing to illuminate their establishments in honor of the occasion.  Two large Sixteenth street establishments are preparing for electrical illuminations on a large scale, one of them having ordered twenty-five extra arc lights for the purpose.  The Bee building will be magnificently illuminated with red, white and blue incandescent lights.  City Electrician Schurig has been hard at work for several days getting in the illuminating apparatus which was used on the city hall last year, and these will all be in place before night.  A number of down town firms are making arrangements to add to these features in a smaller way.</p>
                            <p>Since yesterday Grand Marshal Wilcox has decided to add another division to the parade.  This will be the Sixth or Council Bluffs division.  So many assurances of participation on the part of Council Bluffs officials and organizations were received that it was thought best to make them constitute a separate division.  It will be headed by a band and Council Bluffs officials in carriages.</p>
                            <p>Major Wilcox wishes to impress drivers of carriages and vehicles with the desirability  of their keeping out of the line of march during the parade.  There is danger that if the teams press too closely into the crowd some of them will take fright from the red fire and fireworks and injure some of the spectators.  The police will also be requested to enforce this regulation.</p>
                            <p>The line of march of the parade will be as follows:  On Sixteenth street from Izard to Farnam, on Farnam to Eighteenth, on Eighteenth to Harney, on Harney to Fifteenth, on Fifteenth to Farnam, on Farnam to Tenth, on Tenth to Douglas, on Douglas to Fifteenth, on <choice><sic>Fiftenth</sic><corr>Fifteenth</corr></choice> to Jefferson square, where the speeches will be delivered.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Transmississippians to Take Part in the Big Jubilee.</head>
                            <p>The transmississippians of Council Bluffs held a meeting last evening and spent some time in discussing the prominent part that Council Bluffs will take in the big enterprise.  The meeting was called for the purpose of perfecting arrangements and giving definite shape to the part that Council Bluffs is to play in the ratification jubilee in Omaha this evening.  Mayor Carson was chosen chairman of the meeting and Clarence Judson secretary.  It was decided that the column that Council Bluffs should send across the big bridge should be one of imposing proportions.  Many are eager to go, and the best way of getting them together was a problem that was anxiously discussed.  Committees were appointed to wait upon all military and civic organizations and invite them to participate.  After some discussion the following general invitation was issued:</p>
                            <p>"In pursuance of a resolution of a mass meeting of business men of Council Bluffs, held at the council chamber on Thursday evening, June 25, an invitation is hereby extended to all citizens, secret <choice><sic>orderes</sic><corr>orders</corr></choice>, military and civic organizations are requested to report to George F. Wright the probable number who will attend.  Every one is urgently requested to join in this jubilee, and take part in the parade, which occurs in Omaha between 7 and 9 o'clock.  Take motors not later than 6:30 o'clock.  George Carson, chairman."</p>
                            <p>Colonel Daily was chosen to act as marshal of the Council Bluffs contingent and lead them to their places in the line.  The transportation question was settled by appointing George F. Wright and L. A. Casper as a committee to wait upon the motor company.</p>
                            <p>After this business had been transacted and all the preliminary arrangements made for the expedition to Omaha this evening the meeting proceeded to discuss the great benefit the exposition would be to Council Bluffs, and the interest that it had in making it a success.  Its success was now guaranteed, and whatever part Council Bluffs took in helping it along would be just so much done for the good of the city and its citizens.  Mr. Wright thought that if the Omaha business men could raise $500,000 to put into the enterprise, Council Bluffs should meet it with a purse of at least $100,000, and then the town would be in a position to say something authoritatively about the location.  It was finally agreed that when the meeting adjourned that it adjourn to Tuesday evening, to take the first steps toward beginning the real work of the exposition.  A committee of sixteen was ordered to be selected by George F. Wright and Clarence Judson, and this committee was instructed to name another committee of twenty-five, which should have charge of the exposition work from the present time until the big show closes.  The gentlemen named A. S. Hazelton, C. S. Byers, Charles Beno, S. S. Keller, D. W. Bushnell, C. H. Judson, M. F. Rohrer, E. W. Hart, I. M. Treynor, E. H. Merriam, Lucius Wells, J. R. Bell, William Moore, N. M. Pusey, George F. Wright and C. R. Hannan.  This committee was instructed to name the permanent committee of twenty-five and report the names at the meeting on Tuesday evening.</p>

                            <p>This will no doubt be the largest turnout ever going from South Omaha in one body, as the project is one in which we are all interested, regardless of any selfish reasons.  Let the people of South Omaha turn out en masse and show the citizens of Omaha that we are not only here but that we represent something and are not only in sympathy with the transmississippi movement but we are in the work heart and hand and fully intend to do our part to make it a grand success.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Omaha again donned its festal attire last evening and rejoiced in honor of the exposition.  Enthusiasm that had been pent up for days expressly for the occasion burst forth in unrestrained carnival.  The big parade and the official celebration of Jefferson square were only features of the show.  More inspiring than all was the tremendous crowd that packed the streets from wall to wall and surged and cheered and exuberated as though each man, woman and child among its swelling thousands realized that the exposition meant bread and butter for themselves and prosperity for Nebraska in the days to come.  And the big delegation that came across the river to jubilate with Nebraskans was no less enthusiastic and helped to emphasize the object lesson that the river was no longer a dividing line.</p>
                            <p>Properly speaking it was the formal celebration by the business organizations and citizens generally of the passage of the exposition bill.  But the occasion took on a broader scope.  It developed into not only a celebration of what had been done, but the expression of an enthusiastic determination to accomplish what still remains to do.  The rejoicing over the successful consummation of the legislation that gave the enterprise its first substantial impetus merged itself into an inspiration of future achievements.  The cry that was voiced from thousands of throats was not "Hurrah for the Bill."  It was "Hurrah for the Exposition."  The transparencies that illuminated the marching columns bore no mention of the past, but portrayed in vivid letters what Omaha would be in 1898.</p>

                            <p>And even then the Divine blessing was not wanting to cheer Nebraska's hopes.  Long before the hour of jollification approached huge banks of black, menacing clouds began to mount above the southern horizon.  They multiplied and closed in one compact and threatening mass.  The air was still with that indefinable quietude that heralds the coming storm.  The big crowds in the streets were dumb with disappointment as nature seemed to be determined to mar or ruin the hopes that centered on a successful climax to Omaha's rejoicing.  Slowly the clouds closed over the whole sky and a few scattered drops of rain seemed the forecast of a steady downpour.  But almost at the very moment when the order to march was passed down the columns of the big parade a gorgeous rainbow burst across the black expanse and rested in benison on Nebraska soil.  It was a glorious omen and it was accepted with ringing cheers that echoed all along the line of march.  The rain ceased, the clouds retreated in confusion, and Omaha proceeded to do honor to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Last night's celebration was an indication of what can be done with a few days' preparation when the right sort of spirit is in evidence.  While the parade did now pretend to the gorgeousness of those of last fall it was more than creditable to the

                            city and to the men who have worked faithfully during the past few days to organize its various elements.  Moreover, it indicated the general loyalty of the people to the enterprise, for it was almost entirely composed of volunteers who had spontaneously contributed their services without the spur of a personal application.  There was a commendable representation of the various secret and benevolent societies many of them in uniform.  The labor organizations were out in force and although no compensation was promised every band in the city turned out to add inspiration to the occasion.</p>
                            <p>The decorations along the line of march were general and some very artistic effects were improvised at short notice.  The city hall and The Bee building were brilliantly illuminated with incandescent lights in the same designs that were used during the Ak-Sar-Ben festivities last year.  The Elks' club rooms were artistically draped with flags and Chinese lanterns and a large number of the downtown business establishments were decked out with flags and Ak-Sar-Ben streamers.  The Sixteenth street front of one large establishment was illuminated by twenty-five arc lights, arranged in rows on each story.  A number of business houses had private displays of fireworks and these, together with the red fire and rockets that accompanied the parade were sufficient to keep the line of march illuminated with pyrotechnical colors.</p>

                            <p>But the distinctive and emphatic feature of the occasion was the crowd.  It lined Sixteenth street from Cuming to Harney with solid banks of people.  It jammed Farnam and Douglas streets for eight blocks and there were still enough left to overflow the court house square and people the windows and balconies of all the buildings along the line of march with enthusiastic spectators.  It seemed that almost the entire population of the city was congregated along the streets on which the parade was to move.  They began to gather before 7 o'clock, and for an hour after all the motor trains moving down town were loaded to the foot boards.  Long before the arrival of the parade it was almost impossible to move along the sidewalks and soon the people overflowed into the street.  The throng was more dense around the court house and down Farnam and Sixteenth streets, but the line was unbroken all along the route which the parade was to follow.  All classes were represented with equal liberality.  Society women stood on tiptoe on the curb and waved their handkerchiefs, and husky laborers from the shops contributed their hardened lungs to swell the cheers of rejoicing.  The passage of the parade was marked by what seemed like one continuous cheer, which rose in front of the platoon of police that headed the procession and only subsided after the last blaze of red fire had burned out.  The Second Infantry band received an extra share of favor.  The multitude expressed its regret at the departure of the soldier musicians by cheering them at every turn.  But the demonstration reached its apex when the initiatory float of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben had passed.</p>
                            <p>In spite of the densely packed streets there were no serious accidents during the celebration.  A falling rocket struck in the crowd at Sixteenth and Dodge streets, but did no greater damage than to penetrate the hat of a spectator.  A child that had succeeded in reaching a perch on the roof of one of the low buildings at Sixteenth and Farnam streets created a temporary sensation by doing its best to fall from the cornice, but it was happily corralled by a maternal raid before it succeeded.  Occasional sparks from the Roman candles menaced some of the feminine apparel on the

                            curbstones, but such annoyances were overlooked in the general jubilation.</p>

                            <p>There was but a slight delay in getting the immense procession in motion and at 8:20 the first division received the order to march.  At the head were four mounted policemen marching in open order, clearing the street to the full width.  After them came a detail of police on foot, thirty-two strong, marching in double fours.  Grand Marshal Wilcox and Aids Penfold and Bennett, all mounted, followed and then came the Second regiment of regular troops, seven companies, under command of Colonel Bates and headed by the famous band, whose strains have delighted the people of Omaha for so many years.</p>
                            <p>The Seventh Ward Military band, thirty strong, followed the regulars, and the next in line were the Omaha Guards under command of Captain Mulford.  The Guards wore their fatigue uniforms with white pants, and were greeted with applause.  Following them were the Thurston Rifles, the champions of the United States, under command of Captain Foye.  The boys wore their fatigue uniforms and presented a soldierly appearance and were received all along the line with cheers.  The High School Cadets, two companies, under command of Captain Wagner, came last in this division.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SECOND DIVISION.</head>
                            <p>The second division was under command of Dudley Smith, who presented a striking appearance in a white flannel suit, astride a white horse.  The First Infantry band headed the division and following it came a long double line of carriages, thirty in number, containing city and county officials, officers and directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association and citizens.  In the first carriage were Governor Holcomb, Senator Allen, ex-Governor R. W. Furnas and Adjutant General Berry.  At the head of the opposite line was a carriage containing ex-Senator Manderson, Edward Rosewater, Judge Hayward of Nebraska City and Frank Murphy.  Following the carriage containing the mayor was a long line of carriages containing the members of the city council, members of the Fire and Police commission, members of the Board of Public Works and other city officials and carriages containing the county commissioners and various other county officials.  On the opposite side of the street, behind the carriages of the exposition officers, were a number of carriages containing members of the city council of Council Bluffs and prominent citizens of the Iowa city.  The last five carriages in the line contained the Advertising Men's club of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Following the lines of carriages came the Young Men's Christian association band and the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben.  First came a number of knights mounted upon horses, their handsome regalia being thrown into strong relief by the light of the torches of colored fire borne by the large company of knights marching on foot who came next.  There were about 250 of the knights, on foot, and all were arranged in dominoes of various colors and all masked.  Each man bore a long pole to which was fastened a stick of colored fire kept burning all during the march.  As the fire gave out it was replenished from a cart drawn by a burro.  Most of the members also carried "squawkers," an infernal machine designed to make the most ear-splitting noise imaginable, and the place of the knights in the parade could be located at any time by the awful din and the brilliant light.  The famous initiation float of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben followed the knights.  It was in full operation and revealed to the horror-stricken multitude the initiation ceremony to which aspiring candidates are subjected before they are allowed to wear a domino.  The float was surrounded by red fire and was greeted with tremendous applause along the entire line of march.</p>
                            <p>Next came the Continental Drum corps, fifty strong, and making the music so dear to the heart of the old soldier.  Following the drum corps was U. S. Grant post, Grand Army of the Republic, with twenty-five men, and after them came George Crook post with sixty men.</p>
                            <p>The secret societies came next, headed by the Ancient Order of United Workmen band.  Union Pacific lodge, Ancient Order of United Workmen, came first, with 120 men.  Then came North Omaha lodge No. 159, with a drill team and 150 men in line.  This lodge carried a transparency bearing the inscription "Fair Nebraska&#8212;We Stood by You in Adversity and Are Now with You for Prosperity."  Following this lodge came the drill team of Ak-Sar-Ben lodge, Ancient Order of United Workmen, twelve men in neat uniform.  South Omaha lodge, Ancient Order of United Workmen, came next with fifty men, <choice><sic>carring</sic><corr>carrying</corr></choice> a transparency inscribed "A. O. U. W. Will Be in it at Transmississippi."</p>
                            <p>The lodges of the Modern Woodmen of America followed, headed by the drill team of Omaha camp No. 120 and the lodge itself, 150 strong.  The drill team presented a very striking appearance in its neat uniform and its soldierly bearing.  The drill

                            <p>Then came the Woodmen of the World, represented by the Alpha Guards, thirty men, neatly uniformed.  Seymour camp No. 57, followed, with thirty-five men, carrying a handsome banner.</p>
                            <p>The Bricklayers' Protective union No. 1, with fifty men was next in line, and they were followed by the Machinists' union with about 100 men.</p>

                            <p>The third division was in charge of William Krug as marshal, and was headed by the Odd Fellows' band of Council Bluffs with eighteen men.</p>
                            <p>First came Clan Gordon of the Order of Scottish Clans, sixty strong.  The pipers of the clan marched ahead playing upon the bagpipes, the pipers and several of the members of the clan being in full highland dress.  The other members wore the plaid and bonnet.</p>
                            <p>The Horseshoers' union followed, with seventy-five men in line, and after them came the members of the Turnverein, all dressed in neat gray uniforms, with 150 men in line.</p>
                            <p>Boyd's theater employes came next, sixteen men, each wearing a white jacket.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha Letter Carrier's association brought up the rear of this division with fifty-five men.  The association carried a transparency bearing a number of inscriptions.  These were: "Hurrah for the National Convention of Letter Carriers in 1898&#8212;1,000 Delegates;" "The Exposition Means More People and More Letter Carriers for Omaha;" "Hurrah for the Postoffice Department and Transmississippi Expo;" "Delegations from 500 Free Delivery Cities Will Come to Omaha in 1898."</p>

                            <p>The South Omaha division was headed by Franek's band in a large carryall.  Following this came Mayor Ensor, City Treasurer Frank Broadwell, City Clerk Carpenter and Police Judge Frank Christmann in a carriage.  The members of the city council, Messrs. W. P. Mullaly, Patrick Caldwell, P. L. Hughes, F. J. Franek, William Bennett, W. B. Vansant, Patrick Hyland and John Schultz rode in the two carriages following and then came City Engineer Beal and City Attorney Montgomery in another carriage.</p>
                            <p>Representatives of the South Omaha Board of Trade occupied several carriages.  Among the members were Colonel C. M. Hunt, Major Cress, J. O. Eastman, E. J. Seykora, John Flynn, John McMillan, John Levy, Dr. Berry, John Carroll, Howard Meyers, Thomas O'Neil, David Anderson, Chris Melchor, Ben S. Adams, E. P. Roberts.</p>
                            <p>A banner in one of the Board of Trade carriages read "Our People Are a Unit for the Exposition."  Other banners were "South Omaha Greets the Transmississippi States," "South Omaha Can Feed the Hungry," South Omaha is with the Exposition to a Finish" and several similar mottoes.</p>
                            <p>In a tallyho coach following the city officials rode Mrs. Charles H. Watts, Mrs. Ed Gates, Mrs. J. S. Walters and the Misses Calkins, Honey, Kirby and Ritchhart.</p>
                            <p>A large carryall decorated with flags and several transparencies came next, in which rode C. A. Etter, F. Burch, Ed Gates, Frank Crawford, Frank Etter, William Whitman, E. E. Cole, S. W. Griffith, H. Broer, C. H. Watts and Roy Dusenbery, who carried a large transparency which read "South Omaha, the Future Stock Market of America."</p>
                            <p>The feature of the South Omaha division was the long line of horsemen.  Over eighty mounted men were in line, with Colonel A. L. Lott as marshal and J. S. Walters and W. B. Cheek as lieutenants and B. E. Wilcox as aide.  Nearly every horse was

                            decorated with small flags, and many of the riders carried flags in their hands.</p>
                            <p>A large number of citizens in carriages also occupied places in the line, as did also three lodges of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, with the team in the lead under command of Captain Miller.</p>

                            <p>The fifth division was composed entirely of wheelmen and was under the direction of E. B. Henderson.  The Western Union Wheel club, fifty strong, led off the division.  The members of the club were all messenger boys, dressed in neat uniforms, blue sweaters and brown knee pants.  Many of the wheels were decorated with the Ak-Sar-Ben colors.</p>
                            <p>The Union Pacific Wheel club, under the management of Dundee Reed, turned out sixty men, while behind followed 150 of the Tourists, commanded by Captain Spencer.  The rear of the division was brought up by the unorganized wheelmen, captained by W. C. Bouck.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>When the parade drew up before the specially constructed stand in Jefferson square the city and county officials, the officials and guests from Council Bluffs and South Omaha and the guests from surrounding towns, including Congressman Mercer and Senator Allen and Colonel John Doniphan of St. Joseph, alighted from the carriages which had borne them, and took seats upon the platform.  The stage was filled to overflowing and the occupants looked out upon a sea of faces which all turned upon the rostrum which occupied the front.</p>
                            <p>"The Transmississippi exposition will be in Omaha in 1898," said President Wattles of the board of directors of the exposition company, who acted as chairman.  "That was settled when the government bill was passed.  It was settled when Senator Allen introduced the bill in the senate.  It was settled when Representative Mercer introduced a like measure in the house of representatives.  It was settled when President Cleveland signed the bill."</p>
                            <p>With these words Mr. Wattles opened the flow of addresses which followed.  His remarks were followed by great applause.  Thereafter he at once introduced Governor Holcomb as the first speaker.</p>
                            <p>After a few preliminary remarks, in which the governor stated that he was rejoiced to once more address an Omaha audience, although he preferred to do it in smaller sections, he continued as follows:  "This magnificent spectacle, this great street parade, emphasizes the fact that the projectors of the exposition did better than they knew when they, few in numbers, first promulgated the idea of an exposition.  It shows that the exposition will be a great enterprise.  It displays the great appreciation that the government has assured the success of the enterprise by an appropriation.  It shows that the delegation to congress, and especially of the one who has persistently fought to bring about the success were appreciated.</p>
                            <p>"I have watched the progress of the project from the time that the resolution was passed in last November.  I have been impressed at the encouragement it has been received, not only from the transmississippi country, but from the entire United States.  Every step has been fraught with a determination to make it a grand success, to make it equal to any exposition held in the last quarter of a century.  The entire transmississippi country has conspired to make it a mighty success.  Why not?  It is intended to exhibit the products of a great empire, one-third of the wealth of the country.  It should be made the greatest exposition the country has seen, the Columbia exposition alone excepted.</p>
                            <p>"The burden must fall largely upon Omaha.  It is proper, therefore, that it should have turned out to celebrate.  It is proper that the neighboring housewife should have joined in the celebration.  Thereby the states will be encouraged to assist the greatest display of the close of the nineteenth century.  The great cities will assist.  The country will be shown what the west has done in the way of products and manufactures.</p>
                            <p>"Profit by the experience of other exposition.  Let not one dollar be unnecessarily expended.  But twenty-four months will elapse before the exposition is opened.  Let not a month pass without decisive and important movements, but let each be a milestone to register progress in the enterprise.  Gather together all the wealth from the four corners of the earth."</p>
                            <p>Governor Holcomb's remarks were followed by cheers, which were redoubled when Congressman Mercer was announced and introduced by Chairman Wattles.</p>

                            <p>"When I left Omaha last fall I saw none but gloomy faces," began the congressman.  "When I returned recently I saw those faces sparkling with hope.  It seemed as if Omaha had been born again, had been inspired with a new hope to prosper as in the days of yore.  This was due to the fact that the exposition bill had passed.  The people intend to make it a great success and I hope the future will not disappoint them.</p>

                            <p>"It was a difficult thing to pass the bill.  The government was borrowing $262,000,000, but no one could help seeing that the exposition would be a great thing to Nebraska, Iowa and the entire transmississippi country.  Therefore no one could say no to the appropriation and it was passed.</p>
                            <p>"I have had conversations with western representatives.  From them I have learned that the entire west is slowly combining to make the exposition a success of the highest order."</p>
                            <p>At the end of his speech Congressman Mercer presented in a few words to President Wattles the pen with which President Cleveland had signed the exposition bill.</p>
                            <p>Thereupon Mr. Wattles introduced Senator Allen, who he stated had devoted his best efforts from first to last to bring about the passage of the government bill.</p>

                            <p>After stating that he did not like an opportunity where he was restricted as to time in making a speech, Senator Allen said that the exposition was not only an important thing for Omaha, but for the entire northwest.  He said that nothing equalling it in importance had ever occurred in the western states.  He was glad to see that Omaha, in accordance with its past traditions, was determined to make it a great success.  He felt that the entire country would not only sympathize with her, but aid her in bringing the project to a successful issue.  He did not believe that the interest would be confined to the transmississippi country, but would extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  Therefore he thought that liberal exhibits would come from Mexico and even European countries.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen held that the exposition would exhibit the great energy and enterprise of the west and would thereby bring many to the western states.  He considered that it would be a great educator, because the products of the fields, of the mines and of the masses of the west would be displayed.  It would appeal to the outside world and bring farmers and mechanics to the state.</p>
                            <p>"You must take hold with determination to succeed," continued Senator Allen.  "Congressman Mercer and I will work hand in hand to secure the appropriation to being work on the government building as soon as possible.  But you must all take up the project to make it succeed.  Every man, woman and child in Nebraska and neighboring states must assist in the work."</p>
                            <p>The remarks of Senator Allen were received with great applause.  At their conclusion Chairman Wattles introduced ex-Governor Furnas.  He said that he was glad to join in a celebration which marked an epoch in the history of Omaha, Nebraska and the west.  He said that he realized that the exposition was a scheme of vast importance, but he had no fear of the result.</p>

                            <p>He stated  that in his opinion the exposition would be the greatest of educators.  Moreover, he believed that it meant millions of dollars to Omaha citizens.  Therefore he thought that unusual efforts should be made within the city to raise the required means to set it a-going.</p>
                            <p>"The biggest burden must fall upon Omaha," he said.  "But the great benefits will be realized by its citizens.  Therefore people who give money must not look upon themselves as contributors, but as investors.  Chicago people made great money on their exposition.  Therefore, I do not believe that you will have any difficulty in

                            raising $250,000 or four times that amount."</p>
                            <p>The next speaker introduced by Chairman Wattles was Hon. John N. Baldwin of Council Bluffs.  The few words of his introduction, referring especially to the work and interest that the Iowa people have displayed in the exposition, called forth considerable cheering.</p>
                            <p>"There is not a man, woman or child in Council Bluffs or Omaha," said Mr. Baldwin, "who is not heartily in sympathy with the exposition and hopes for a magnificent success.  This does not, however, apply particularly to these two cities, but to the entire west.</p>
                            <p>"There are many in the east who believe that the Indians are still driven into the streams in the west.  The exposition is intended to show that this is not true.  It will also show that the great western empire has not stopped at the Mississippi river and stayed there.  It will prove that when the Mississippi is crossed a peep has just been taken through the east line fence.  It will demonstrate that the great valleys of the west have been greatly improved.  Why, the eggs laid by our hens in the west, if placed end to end, would girdle the world twice.  The exposition will further show the people of the country that our eggs and butter are of much more worth than all the silver in Colorado, and the corn crop of Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas of more worth than the entire gold and silver product of the United States.</p>
                            <p>"The exposition must be a success.  This glorious celebration of tonight must lead to success.  In this way we must march to success, believing that 'my first, my best country is ever my home.'</p>
                            <p>Mr. Baldwin's speech was received heartily and the applause continued when General Charles F. Manderson was introduced to the audience.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MEMORIES OF ANOTHER PARADE.</head>
                            <p>"In 1867 I saw another parade in Omaha," said General Manderson.  "It had few witnesses and the line was short.  It was given for the purpose of rejoicing over the fact that the last spike had been driven to complete the Union Pacific, the two ends of the continent being thus connected by ribs of steel."</p>
                            <p>The general contrasted the city of that time, with only a small population, to the city of today, with its 140,000 inhabitants.  At that time there were not as many in the whole state as witnessed the present parade.  In these elapsing thirty years, General Manderson said, a great empire had grown up which was to be glorified in the exposition of 1898.</p>
                            <p>"I am glad to see that differences of politics and religion are forgotten," he continued, "in the anxiety to make the exposition a success.  The burden together with the glory rests upon us.  It means a tremendous task which is only to be accomplished by united action.  Every man and women must put the shoulder to the wheel and must forget dissension and animosities in order that the work may go on unitedly."</p>
                            <p>General Manderson gave especial praise to President Wattles for the directory of the work that had been accomplished, saying that he had shown energy, determination and the elements of true manhood.</p>
                            <p>Colonel John Doniphan of St. Joseph, vice president for Missouri, the next speaker introduced, congratulated the mass of citizens for the success of the occasion.  He predicted that the exposition would be as great a success, without any doubt.  His faith was especially founded on the centrality of Omaha's location in the country.  He found another reason for the suitability of holding the exposition in Omaha in the historic fact that the river upon which it was situated had been explored by Lewis and Clark in 1804, the expedition being under the instructions of President Jefferson.  These two adventurers first notified the Indians of this section of the country that the great Louisiana purchase had been ceded to the United States.  In view of these historical incidents Colonel Doniphan believed that the location of the exposition, in the very heart of the Louisiana purchase, was most appropriate.</p>
                            <p>South Omaha was represented by James H. Van Dusen, who said: "The idea of holding a congress upon this side of the Mississippi river, calling together all the great states of this vast western country, originated, as I understand, in this metropolis of Nebraska.  It was born out of the spirit of exhibitions which commenced with the great fetes planned by Louis Napoleon when the second empire of France was tottering to destruction.  On behalf of the magic city on the south, whose commercial interests are so closely allied with yours that she furnishes bread and clothing for more than 1,000 families of your city, I bespeak her hearty co-operation.</p>
                            <p>"The demonstration which we have all witnessed tonight shows that the people of this state and county are awake to the importance of the event.  It touches not only the interests of the merchants, but of the masses.  It will breathe a new spirit of life into the people; it will bring to this city visitors from the north and the south, from the east and the west, and from across the ocean; it will unite the interest of the west, and produce cordiality with the east; it will teach the readers of the Atlantic Monthly, the Iowans, Nebraskans and westerners in general have something besides

                            <p>This completed the program of speeches for the evening, and Chairman Wattles adjourned the meeting by calling for three cheers for the congressmen of Nebraska and other states who had brought about the passage of the exposition bill, and for the exposition of 1898.  The cheers were given with a hearty will as the assemblage dispersed.</p>
                            <p>Telegrams were received expressing regrets at their inability to be present and giving words of cheer for the enterprise from the following:  Governor William A. Richards of Wyoming, Governor W. T. Thornton of New Mexico, Governor A. W. McIntyre of Colorado, Governor Charles H. Sheldon of South Dakota, Secretary of State Piper of Nebraska, Thomas H.

                            <p>Last evening's festival demonstrated the fact that fires are almost an absent quantity in Omaha, even when the city covers itself with a halo of fiery glory.  Blue and red flash lights sputtered and fizzled on every corner and near Sixteenth and Douglas streets vast quantities of it caused a cloud of smoke to float many yards upward, until it was lost in the distance.  Paper balloons sped off in every direction and scattered their blazing contents over the just and wicked alike, yet nowhere was any damage recorded.  In almost every window along the line of march fireworks were touched off to add their quota of blaze and din to the general jollification, yet no one was hurt and the burning brands fell harmlessly to the ground.  The fire department held itself in readiness to answer alarms which might be turned in from the crowded streets, but its services was not called into requisition.</p>

                            <p>If the Transmississippi exposition is to be held during the summer of 1898 as contemplated by the act of congress granting it recognition no time should be lost in the preparatory work which devolves upon its managers.  Only twenty-three months remain before the opening of the exposition and every day and every hour of that time will be precious.</p>
                            <p>The most essential thing to the success of the exposition is the financing of the enterprise.  In that respect the public spirit of Atlanta was exhibited in marked contrast with that of Omaha.  The first suggestion of the Atlanta exposition was made in the middle of December, 1893, and within three weeks from that time the permanent organizations of the project was effected and work was commenced upon a guaranteed subscription of a half million dollars, with an authorized capital of $5,000,000.  The Atlanta exposition was designed to embrace only the cotton states, but finally included exhibits from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Illinois and California, while of the cotton states, Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina, Florida and Arkansas made special appropriations for their own buildings.  The foreign exhibits at Atlanta comprised those from Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Russia, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentine, Salvador, Chile, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.  It will thus be seen that the managers of the Atlanta exposition were in a great measure successful in making their exposition not only interstate, but international.  This success was due to the fact that the finances of the enterprise were promptly arranged and placed upon a sound basis and thus enabled them to direct and concentrate their energies early to the great task of enlisting the co-operation of other states and foreign countries.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that the plan of the Transmississippi exposition must be on a more extensive scale it becomes imperative upon our citizens to delay no longer in coming to the front with their financial support.  We can not invite foreign nations to participate until after the president shall have issued his proclamation announcing that the exposition, is to be held and that it will be accorded all the privileges that had pertained to international expositions.  The president's proclamation will not be forthcoming until the first $250,000 of stock subscriptions or donations have been secured.</p>
                            <p>With more than twenty months at their disposal after the guarantee of the first $500,000 had been secured, with the enthusiastic backing of the southern people and with the most energetic work, the managers were compelled to open the Atlanta exposition with several of the buildings unfinished and many exhibits not yet in place.  The Transmississippi exposition will require not only larger resources in money and labor, but also more time for the work of preparation.  If we are to obtain the fullest possible benefits from this great undertaking, the principal bureaus and departments should be organized immediately and set in motion.  That they can not be set in motion without money goes without saying.  The way to put them in motion is to complete the stock subscription list at once.</p>

                            <p>The committee of twenty-five known as the bureau of finance, in connection with the Trans-Mississippi exposition, met at the Commercial club yesterday afternoon and decided to recommend to the board of directors that the present stockholders of the exposition be called together at an early date to make some amendments in the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the organization.</p>
                            <p>These changes are the reduction of the value of stock shares from $10 to $5; the increasing of the board of directors to not less than fifty, the present board to be members of the enlarged board, and an executive committee appointed from the board to consist of not less than five nor more than nine, which shall have direct management of the exposition.  There were some minor changes suggested to make the laws conform to these amendments.</p>
                            <p>The present board of directors will hold a meeting the fore part of the week to consider these recommendations, and it is probably that the stockholders will be called together to take such action as has been suggested.</p>

                            <p>Everybody seemed anxious to add a mite to the general good feeling prevailing in the city over what appears to be the successful beginning of an important undertaking, and that frequently disappointing, yet never despairing Hope, upon which all depend for the future, gave the crowd a zeal and earnestness it had no experienced for some time.  It was interesting and encouraging and the croaker and the pessimist had no place in the festivities.</p>

It was not the riff raff of a city that helped Omaha out in the parade last night from South Omaha, but the better element, merchants, bankers, commission men, packers and citizens in the upper walks of life.  They all came, and they were all glad of an opportunity to do so, and the big sister on the north welcomed them with wide-open arms and a gladness of heart.</p>
                            <p>The head of the South Omaha division was <choice><sic>lead</sic><corr>led</corr></choice> by Mayor Ensor and the city council and city officials.  In the first carriages, which were appropriately decorated for the occasion, were Mayor Ensor and Councilmen VanSant, Schultz, Bennett, Caldwell, Hughes, Mullaly, Franck and Hyland; next came City Treasurer F. A. Broadwell, City Clerk R. A. Carpenter, City Engineer Herman Beal, Judge Christmann, Street Commissioner John Ross, Poundmaster Joe Maly.</p>
                            <p>Then followed Franck's brass band of twenty pieces and the board of trade members in carriages.  Among the members were noticed such energetic workers as Colonel C. M. Hunt, Major J. W. Cress, Joe Eastman, E. J. Seykora, John McMillan, John Flynn, David Anderson, Judge J. Levy, Dr. Berry, J. C. Carroll, H. Meyers, T. J. O'Neill, C. A. Melchor, J. S. Gosney, J. M. Glasgow, Ben S. Adams, E. C. Lane, Clinton Morgan and others.</p>

                            <p>Next in line were citizens in carriages.  There were carriage loads driven by F. A. Cressey, James H. Bulla, C. J. Collins, Mr. Rice, Jake Klein, Antone Pivonka, B. E. Hawley, W. G. Bentley, Jeff Cooley, Frank Bomback, J. J. Ryan and others.  In all, it is safe to say that South Omaha had 1,000 people in the line of march last evening, and they made their presence felt.</p>
                            <p>One of the features of the parade from South Omaha was a tally-ho load of young business men that carried banners and shouted till they were hoarse.  They had a college cry that told something about beefsteak in the Magic City, and were not afraid to say so under the direction of Lieutenant L. F. Etter and <unclear reason="torn"/>

                            Crawters, Ed Gates, Fred Etter, William Whitmann, E. E. Cole, G. W. Griffith, H. Broer, C. H. Watts and Roy Duesenbery, who carried on the front seat a banner.</p>
                            <p>A board of trade banner was carried by E. T. Roberts, and was appropriately inscribed.</p>
                            <p>Then came a number of South Omaha's civic societies.  There were three divisions of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, a delegation from the Odd Fellow lodges, Woodmen of the World, Modern Woodmen of America and others.</p>
                            <p>A banner carried by a stalwart South Omahan read "Senator Allen Appreciated by the Magic City."</p>

                            <p>Perhaps one of the most interesting features of the parade from South Omaha was the company of cavalrymen under the supervision of Colonel A. L. Lott, assisted by Lieutenants J. S. Walters and W. B. Cheek and Aide B. E. Wilcox.  There were sixteen white horses in the lead, ridden by representative men of the stock interests of the Magic City.  All together there were eighty horsemen, and their riders all rode like veterans from start to finish.</p>
                            <p>Among other South Omaha banners were these: "South Omaha Crows for the Exposition," "All Hail to Allen and Mercer," "South Omaha Can Feed Them All."</p>
                            <p>Another pleasing feature of the South Omaha delegation was the showing made by the wheelmen of that thriving city.  Their number was large and they all were imbued with a determination to show the people of Omaha that they could ride well, and they did so.  The sight was a pretty one.</p>
                            <p>South Omaha is to be congratulated on the showing made last night.</p>
                            <p>Fifth division, E. B. Henderson, marshal:  Western Union Bicycle club, 21 members; Union Pacific club, 14 members; Young Men's Christian association club, 52 members; Tourist Wheelmen, 120 members; unorganized wheelmen, 19 riders.</p>

                            <p>Jefferson square has witnessed a great many demonstrations, but none that rivalled the one of last night in magnitude and intensity of enthusiasm for the future of Omaha and the west.  A platform on the south side was seated with 300 chairs, occupied by citizens of Omaha, Council Bluffs, South Omaha

                            and distinguished visitors.  In the rear were the stars and the bars as a centerpiece in the background.  On either side in front were draped the colors of the Ak-Sar-Ben.  The people were crowded in a dense mass to the north far beyond the hearing of the voices of the speakers.  The crowd remained enthusiastic to the end, giving with a hearty will the final three cheers for the exposition and its promoters.</p>
                            <p>Upon the platform were seated city officials of Omaha, members of the city council, the Commercial club and prominent citizens of the city, and Mayor Ensor, J. T. O'Neill, J. H. Van Dusen and a goodly representation from South Omaha.  The delegation from Council Bluffs, including Mayor Carson, John M. Baldwin, Dr. Thomas, C. H. Judson, secretary of the retail dealers' association, P. C. Duval, A. Wollman, Clinton Byers, R. Williams, E. H. Walters, General E. S. Test, M. C. Vanderveer, Dr. Cleaver, George T.

                            <head type="sub">STRUCK THE RIGHT KEYNOTE.</head>
                            <p>By request of C. E. Weller, president of the Commercial club, President Wattles of the exposition company, presided during the evening.  When Mr. Wattles rose to open the exercises he was greeted with appreciative applause of the audience, which broke into cheers as he uttered his first sentence, "Fellow citizens of the Trans-Mississippi country, the Trans-Mississippi exposition will <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>be</corr></choice> held in the city of Omaha in 1898."  That fact was forever settled, he said, when the Allen bill passed the senate and Mercer pushed it through the house.  With a few complimentary words he introduced "his excellency, Governor Holcomb," as the first speaker.</p>
                            <p>The governor began by saying that when he wanted to address the people of Omaha he preferred talking to them when divided in sections.  And he drew the line on making a speech to them when their number was increased by half of Council Bluffs and South Omaha.  He said that when the people witnessed the grand pageant and wondrous demonstration of the evening they could not help but think that the originators of the exposition who had planned the great enterprise under many difficulties had <choice><sic>builded</sic><corr>built</corr></choice> better than they knew, when it was undertaken to advertise the great resources of the Trans-Mississippi country.  The demonstration attended by such large masses of people attested the appreciation of the efforts of those who shouldered the burden and worked to inaugurate the greatest enterprise the west has ever undertaken.</p>
                            <p>The movement originated in the Trans-Mississippi congress held in Omaha last fall and since that time there has been a marvelous unanimity among citizens of this state and its neighbors to make the exposition a success.  It has had the good will and encouragement of every man, woman and child in the Trans-Mississippi country.</p>
                            <p>"So far," he continued, "every step has been fraught with encouragement and intensity of enthusiasm for one of the greatest expositions held in the last quarter of a century.  About one-fourth of the population of this great country has determined to bring about the greatest exposition ever held in the United States, the World's fair alone excepted."  The western states are all interested.  California and the states of the Pacific coast have pledged their aid.  The east will be represented, it will be an exhibit of the wealth of North America and perhaps of some of continental Europe as well.  It might well be called an international exposition, for such it will be.</p>

                            <p>Congressman Mercer was greeted with a volley of cheers as he stepped to the front of the platform.  He alluded to the great depression through which Nebraska and other states of the union have been passing&#8212;a depression of the whole country, which affected Omaha as well.  He used a happy expression in commenting upon the change that is even now here, when he said "Omaha has been born again, she will prosper as in days of yore."  The prospect of the exposition, he thought heralded good times for Omaha.  It would be the greatest exposition held on American soil.  The whole country had recognized the importance of the west.  He complimented the management of the board of directors and those who framed the enterprise and in conclusion presented President Wattles with a copy of the bill, with the president's own signature attached.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles next introduced a man "without whose efforts we would not be here tonight&#8212;the man whose efforts to pass the first bill through the senate were watched by a grateful people, Senator William V. Allen."  The senator gracefully acknowledged the

                                remarks by saying that there was a time for long speeches, but this was not one of those times, which created a great laugh among his hearers.  He came not to make a speech, but to congratulate the people of Omaha upon the fact that the Trans-Mississippi exposition is now an assured thing.  He said he would like to make a long speech, as when his time was limited to a few minutes, it took out all the glory of his speech and pleasure in its delivery.  The audience laughed again, as it remembered how his threat to make a perennial speech in the senate had accomplished great things for the exposition bill.  "It is an important event in the history of Nebraska and the west, if not the whole United States," continued the senator, more seriously.  "No public event has happened for a long time which has meant so much for the west as the Trans-Mississippi exposition."</p>

                            <p>He said he was pleased to see Omaha take hold of the enterprise with such splendid enthusiasm, which would not meet with anything else than the anticipated success.  He reviewed the benefits that would accrue to the west from the enterprise and affirmed that the good derived would not be reaped along by the Trans-Mississippi country, but would reach from coast to coast, as well as other countries of the continent.  He urged unity of action among the states, saying:  "The great northwest, which has been the leader of civilization for the last forty or fifty years, must be true on this occasion."</p>
                            <p>The country would not be satisfied to let the city do it all.  But every village, every humble home of the farmer and the mechanic would be fired with zeal for the success of the great enterprise.  He urged that none should quarrel about who originated the exposition.  That is a small matter and the great end can only be accomplished by the united effort of all the states.  He concluded by saying that it would be his pleasure to introduce an amendment to the deficiency bill next session of congress providing for an additional appropriation of $200,000 or $300,000.</p>

                            <p>Ex-Governor Robert W. Furnas was introduced as the man who had been working on expositions in Nebraska for the last half century.  He responded in his usual happy manner.  He said he knew that Omaha was made of the right stuff to engineer the expositions of the kind on a smaller scale, mentioning the state exhibit which Nebraska had at the New Orleans exposition.  "Why," said he, "ask me whether the people of Omaha can raise $250,000 for a starter; they can raise four times
                            
                                <pb/><!-- <pb n="199" xml:id="TMISB01-199"/> -->
                            
                            that amount, if it should be necessary.  I know what Omaha can do, and what energy characterizes its splendid citizenship."  He said that not a dollar would be expended which would not be a big return.  The people are not to be asked to contribute, but to invest.  The investment will be a paying one.</p>

                            <p>John M. Baldwin of Council Bluffs made a magnificent speech.  It was an oration delivered in his powerful and resonant voice, which told in a masterly style a brief summary of the benefits and purposes of the exposition.  He said there was not a man, woman or child in Iowa who did not join in wishing the undertaking a success.  It means much to the whole Missouri valley, and it does not matter on which side of the river one happens to live.  It would clear up the ridiculous ideas that extreme eastern people have of the Trans-Mississippi country, "those people," said the speaker, "who think Chicago is west, we will show them that when they get west of the Mississippi river they are just peeping through the bars of our east lying fence."</p>
                            <p>He created considerable laughter with his numerous illustrations of the resources of Nebraska and Iowa.  He said:  "The hens in Iowa and Nebraska lay enough eggs in a single year, laid end to end, to girdle the earth twice."  A single corn crop is worth more than all the gold and silver produced in the United States in one year.  "The exposition must be a success," was the text of his discourse.</p>
                            <p>He concluded with a forecast of the extent of the exhibits in the products of the mining and agricultural states and the displays of the arts.  His speech was thoroughly western in spirit and was received with great enthusiasm.</p>

                            <p>Ex-Senator Manderson spoke next.  He said that as he sat on the platform he was reminded of another parade, with a shorter line and attended by a mere handful of people in comparison with the company he addressed.  That parade was in '69, and celebrated the completion of the first transcontinental railroad.  Since that time what marvelous progress had been made.  From a little settlement the town had grown into a city of 140,000 people.  The state has grown proportionately.  "Now a great empire has arisen to glorify itself in 1898."  He expressed himself as being much pleased to see such unanimity on the part of the leading spirits of Omaha, and created considerable amusement by calling attention to the fact that many who had not been on the most cordial terms in former times were now seated on the platform in brotherly harmony and intercourse.  In unanimity, he said, there is success, and success is already assured.  He addressed complimentary words to those who had been instrumental in passing the bill.  Much of the success so far, he said, was due to the untiring efforts of President Wattles, whom he styled the "inspiriting soul of the enterprise, a man endowed with energy, character and all the elements of true manhood."</p>
                            <p>J. H. VanDusen presented in a fitting manner greetings from the Magic City.  He said that the interests of South Omaha were identical with those of this city, and enthusiasm for the exposition there equals that in Omaha.  He promised the people that when millions thronged to Omaha they would find meat to eat in the big packing house down south.  He reviewed the benefits to be derived from the exposition and urged united effort of all to the same great end.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles next introduced the vice president from Missouri, Colonel John Doniphan.  He spoke but briefly, saying that he came to congratulate the people of Omaha on the assured success of its undertaking, and said that the demonstration after the passage of the appropriation bill prognosticated beyond a doubt the success of the exposition.  He said that he was reminded of the fact that he was standing on historic ground and referred to the treaty made ninety-two years ago on the site of Council Bluffs by which the people of this country treated with the Indians with reference to the land acquired by the Louisiana purchase.  He reviewed the progress of the west since that time and prophesied the greater development to result from the advertisement to be obtained through the medium of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>This being the last speech, the audience adjourned with a rousing three cheers and a tiger for the exposition and its promoter at home and in congress, was proposed by President Wattles.</p>

                            <head type="sub">New Phases of the Advertising Arrangements in the Interest of the Transmississippi Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The turkish bath temperature of the city building at Council Bluffs did not deter a large number of the committee of thirty-five from meeting last night and organizing the Council Bluffs end of the work to be done for the great Transmississippi Exposition.  Nearly all of the members of the committee were present and sat around in negligee dress and fanned themselves while discussing the work at hand.</p>
                            <p>Hon. George F. Wright was made permanent chairman of the committee and Clarence Judson was chosen to do the work that the committee would have to do, and if there were an idea that they had been appointed to an honorary position that would give them free tickets to the big show and a chance to poise before the admiring multitude, the idea was quickly dissipated.  Chairman Wright plainly told them that they had work to do and plenty of it.  Among other little things they were expected to raise about $100,000 in cash and interest all the whole state of Iowa in the exposition.  They were to think of nothing else than the exposition, talk about it and even dream about it, if they got a chance to slumber long enough to dream.</p>
                            <p>The permanent subcommittees were provided for by the appointment of the chairmen, and each chairman was given two gentlemen to assist in selecting his general committee.  Lucius Wells was made chairman of the finance committee, and A. S. Hazelton chairman of the ways and means committee.  Mr. Hazelton selected as the members of his committee:  George F. Wright, W. W. Loomis, M. F. Rohrer, T. C. Dawson, V. E. Bender, J. P Greenshields, W. C. Boyer, R. R. Randall, I. M. Treynor, E. A. Troutman, W. J. Davenport, E. A. Wickham and M. Wollman.  Mr. Wells' committee will consist of: George F. Wright, C. R. Hannan, William Moore, E. W. Hart, J. A. Patton, N. P. Dodgem Thomas Office and W. D. Hardin.  It was decided that the mayor and secretary of the committee of thirty-five should be ex-officio members of both committees.</p>
                            <p>After the business was finished the members indulged in an earnest discussion of the exposition subject, and the enthusiasm of the members rose with the length of the speeches.  Mr. Randall spoke of the inestimable benefit that the Atlanta exposition had conferred upon all of the southern states.  The impetus given the south had been greater than if millions of dollars had been expended in permanent improvements and manufactures.  The Omaha exposition would be greater than that, because a greater and richer territory would be laid under tribute.  The south only gathered the products from half a dozen states, old and phlegmatic states at that, but the young giant of the west would call for the best in twenty-four states and three territories.  The response would be quick and enthusiastic.  The Omaha exposition would be as much greater than the Atlanta effort as the World's fair was greater than the Centennial.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hazleton suggested that it would be the duty of the committee to see to it that an exposition plank was introduced into all political platforms that will be constructed in this vicinity during the next year.  He <choice><sic>regreted</sic><corr>regretted</corr></choice> that there was not such a plank in the late congressional platform, pledging Congressman Hager to use his best efforts at all times to further the interests of the exposition.  Every congressman elected in the west this year should be pledged in this way.  He suggested that the democratic and republican state conventions of Iowa this year should be required to make this declaration.  The suggestions were received with enthusiasm, and several of the politicians present pledged themselves to secure the adoption of such a plank in the coming democratic congressional convention.  Such an endorsement would be easily obtained and would be very effective in awakening interest in the exposition, as well as effective in securing required legislation.</p>
                            <p>After some further discussion the committee adjourned to meet at the call of the chairman.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COUNCIL BLUFFS AND THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>The appointment of a committee of the leading men of Council Bluffs to look after the interests of that city and Western Iowa in the coming Trans-Mississippi exposition is an example that commends itself to Sioux City, Des Moines, Dubuque, Davenport and every city and town in that great commonwealth.  In a more general way it commends itself to the people of St. Joseph, Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Denver and other important centers in every state west of the Mississippi river, and especially those towns of our own state.</p>
                            <p>An analysis of the Council Bluffs committee shows it to be one that it thoroughly representative, combining the professions, labor, railroads, banks, newspapers, mercantile, wholesale and retail, agriculture, real estate and all the productive elements of the community.</p>
                            <p>It is fortunate in being headed by George F. Wright, the Trans-Mississippi exposition vice president for Iowa, who is not only eminent as a lawyer, but as a most energetic, public spirited citizen, the "right man in the right place."</p>
                            <p>It is also fortunate in having Mayor George Carson in its membership.  He is thoroughly representative, active and enthusiastic for the development of the west.  He knows and appreciates the value of the exposition and is devoting the influence of his high officer to pushing every interest to the front to make it the grandest display the west has ever seen or ever will see again for coming generations.</p>
                            <p>In justice to the committee, every member is a worker, and we can pick out no name in its membership that has not been identified with some one or more of the great movements that have made the development of the west a marvel in history.</p>
                            <p>From the days of the pioneer to have present many of these men of Iowa have borne the brunt of the struggle in our upward course and they have seen Council Bluffs and Omaha spring from hamlets in the wilderness to proud and beautiful cities in a land of fertile beauty and productiveness.</p>

                            <p>The Omaha Typographical union did a good thing for Omaha and the trade last Sunday at its regular meeting in appointing a committee of five (in addition to its regularly accredited delegates) to attend the coming convention of the printers international union to be held next October in Colorado Springs, Colo.  The committee is a strong one and influential in the affairs of the trade, and there is no doubt they will work hard to secure for Omaha the next printers convention in '98.  They will be pretty well equipped with attractions in our great Transmississippi exposition which it is expected will take on something of an international character, and the printers <choice><sic>could'nt</sic><corr>couldn't</corr></choice> do better than locate their next convention in this city.  This action of the Omaha printers should be followed by other international labor bodies.</p>
                            <p>Omaha is a central location and a favorable place for such gatherings from a common-sense point of view, yet trades union delegates frequently travel from San Francisco to New York and other eastern cities, while if the convention ground was a central one much less expense would be incurred by the unions.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed to secure the next printers convention for us, are all "hustlers."  They are W. C. Boyer of the Bee, Al Small of the Omaha Printing company, Lew W. Raber the job printer and F. A. Kennedy of THE WESTERN LABORER.</p>

                            <p>A resolution was unanimously adopted last Sunday in favor of securing the next I. T. U. convention for Omaha Transmississippi Exposition year&#8212;'98&#8212;and instructing the president to appoint a committee of five to go after it.  President Sturgess appointed the following:  Lew W. Raber, ex-delegate to Louisville and a member of the Commercial club, W. A. Runkles of the Bee and W. C. Boyer of the World-Herald, ex-delegates to Chicago; Al Small of the Omaha Printing company and F. A. Kennedy of THE LABORER.  I think it is a good committee and, I understand, the other members think the same thing.  Now, if 190 will stand pat with the committee, the convention will be landed.  It ought to come to Omaha in '98&#8212;and must.  The union men want it, the business men want it, the Commercial club wants it, the Transmississippi Exposition people want it, the newspapers want it, the job offices want it.  Everybody wants it!  Let's get it!!</p>

                            <p>BATON ROUGE, La., July 3.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Louisiana has joined Iowa, and will be at Omaha in 1898.  Both houses of the legislature have passed and the governor today signed a concurrent resolution, authorizing and empowering the Bureau of Agriculture of this state to make an exhibit of the resources of the state at the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha, beginning in June and ending in November, 1898, as follows:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The congress of the transmississippi states and territories at its last session passed a resolution to hold an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river at Omaha, Neb., in 1898; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The congress of the United States has approved said exposition, and has appropriated $200,000 for a government building a national exhibit at said exposition; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, This exposition will furnish a favorable opportunity to exhibit the great and varied resources of this state and tend to increase the growing commercial relations of this state, not only as a most desirable section for homeseekers, but for safe and profitable investment; therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, by the house, the senate concurring, That the Bureau of Agriculture of this state be and is hereby authorized and empowered to make in the name of the state an exhibit at said exposition, fully showing the great and varied resources of the state and its products, with full information concerning its inhabitants and vast capabilities.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, further, That all cities, citizens, parishes, corporations and commercial organizations of this state are hereby earnestly requested to fully co-operate with said bureau in making said exhibit in every sense worthy of this state and its people.</p>

                            <p>When the house of representatives on June 10 passed the bill providing for a government exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi exposition and the senate concurred in the amendments, and the president affixed his signature thereto, the exposition at the moment became a positive event of the future, with more or less interest attached to every movement in its behalf.  Up to that time it was a vague possibility, about which many people even here in Omaha knew very little, while those in other portions of the country were doubtless in entire ignorance that such an enterprise was contemplated.</p>
                            <p>It being practically settled that the exposition will be held, while the only question involved is in reference to its size and grandeur, it becomes at once an important news feature, and a short sketch of its origin and of the men who have conducted its affairs to the present time, will be of interest both as a matter of reference and as immediate information.</p>

                            <figure><head type="sub">HERMANN KOUNTZE.</head></figure>
                            Trans-Mississippi congress was held in this city last November, beginning on the 25th, and on the 27th the following resolution was introduced by Hon. W. J. Bryan of Lincoln, who was president of the congress:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth producing states, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi states, but to all the home seekers in the world; therefore,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the United States congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September and October in the year 1898,and that the representatives of such states and territories in congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in carrying out this enterprise.</p>
                            <p>The resolution was adopted unanimously, and so much interest was shown in it by the delegates that the citizens of Omaha, who had not previously contemplated the project, took hold of it readily, but with a great many misgivings as to their ability to handle an enterprise which seemed to promise so much.</p>
                            <p>A public meeting of Omaha citizens was held at the Commercial club December 22, to discuss the matter, and a committee composed of C. F. Weller, chairman, C. S. Montgomery, L. H. Bradley, James Walsh, Dudley Smith, E. V. Lewis, A. B. Jaquith and G. W. Wattles was appointed to consider the idea of a permanent organization in the interest of the exposition and to prepare articles of incorporation.</p>
                            <p>This committee met December 27, and after discussing and agreeing upon the salient points to be treated in the articles of incorporation, appointed a sub-committee to formally draw up the papers.</p>
                            <p>The articles were reported to another general meeting held January 18, and

                            adopted.  They provided that stock to the amount of $10,000 must be subscribed before the corporation could begin business, and subscriptions were therefore called for at this meeting and in twenty minutes the sum of $10,650 was subscribed.  After this had been done the meeting was resolved into a stockholders' meeting, and the election of directors taken up.</p>
                            <p>Seventeen names were presented from
                            <figure><head type="sub">DUDLEY SMITH.</head></figure>
                            which to take the eleven directors provided for in the articles of incorporation, and the following were elected:  J. E. Markel, G. W. Wattles, I. W. Carpenter, W. R. Bennett, George H. Payne, C. S. Montgomery, Charles Metz, H. A. Thompson, Dudley Smith, Dan Farrell, jr., and J. H. Evans.</p>
                            <p>The first directors' meeting was held at the Millard hotel January 20, to complete the organization by the election of officers.  G. W. Wattles was elected president after much solicitation, and in face of his declaration that the position would require more time and work than he felt able to give to it.  J. E. Markel was selected vice president and John A. Wakefield secretary.</p>
                            <p>At this early stage in the history of the enterprise the business men of Council Bluffs manifested an interest in the undertaking, and to obtain a fuller knowledge of the purpose of the exposition, the Merchants and Manufacturers' association of that city invited the directors of the exposition to come and dine with them.  This was accepted, and on the 22d of January <choice><sic>neary</sic><corr>nearly</corr></choice> all the directors and several others visited the Iowa city and partook of the hospitality offered.  A few days later the directors reciprocated the social obligation, and a good feeling was cultivated at those meetings which will doubtless be mutually beneficial.</p>
                            <p>At a director's meeting, January 24, Herman Kountze was elected treasurer of the organization, he having signified his willingness to accept the position, and a set of by-laws was adopted.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime, January 3, Senator Allen introduced a bill in the senate calling for government recognition of the exposition and authorizing a government exhibit.  This bill, with some amendments, was the one which afterward became a law.</p>
                            <p>On February 12 the exposition received its first official recognition from outside the state by the passage of resolutions by the legislature of Iowa, which was then in session, indorsing the enterprise and promising aid.</p>
                            <p>Friday, March 20, the directors and a few friends started on a trip of a week's duration to Cheyenne, Salt Lake
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="207" xml:id="TMISB01-207"/> -->
                            
                            City and Denver in the interest of the exposition.  The first state legislature of Utah was in session at the time, and the directors appeared before that body, seeking official recognition.  The legislature was too much occupied with business incident to new statehood honors to give time to discussing the advisability of an appropriation at that early date, but appropriate resolutions were adopted and a pledge made that at the session next winter a suitable appropriation would be made to make a creditable exhibit for the state.  Assurances of support were received, also, from influential people at Cheyenne and Denver, the legislatures in those states meeting next winter.</p>
                            <p>April 10 the Iowa legislature made an appropriation of $10,000 for the preliminary work of an exhibit from that state, and the Hawkeye people, for the third time, took the lead in giving aid and encouragement to the exposition, the citizens of Council Bluffs being the first outside of the state to manifest an interest in the undertaking, the legislature being the first to officially recognize it, and the first to make an appropriation for it.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen had passed his bill through the senate, but it seemed to have struck a snag in the house, and was hung up so long the friends of the exposition became alarmed for its fate.  On April 10 the directors instructed President Wattles to go to Washington and by his presence try to get the measure pushed along.  This had a good effect at the time, but the day of the adjournment of congress was coming on rapidly and the people of Omaha again became alarmed.  These were anxious days for the directors and others, and although the board had held meetings almost every week, the affairs had reached such a point that little business was transacted except the discussion of the best method of securing the passage of that bill, the success of the whole undertaking depending upon that one event.  Finally, almost on the eve of adjournment, June 10, the bill was taken up and passed.  The senate concurred in the amendments made by the house, and the president signed the measure on the same day.</p>
                            <p>There was joy in Omaha that day, and that evening there was much good feeling and congratulation at a public meeting which had been called for another purpose.  Later there was a great parade with accompanying fireworks, in honor of the event, and the people realized that they were going to have an exposition which would take second place only to the World's fair among expositions in this country.</p>
                            <p>Another mass meeting of the citizens was held to discuss ways and means for the work which was now necessary to
                            <figure><head type="sub">JOHN A. WAKEFIELD.</head></figure>
                            be done, followed by other meetings, the work of which is familiar to the readers of the World-Herald.</p>
                            <p>A committee composed of President Wattles, J. B. Sheean, J. H. Macomber and Thomas Kilpatrick was sent to Louisiana to urge the legislature of that state, then in session, to make an 
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="209" xml:id="TMISB01-209"/> -->
                            
                            appropriation for a state exhibit.  The committee arrived in Baton Rouge too late to secure the appropriation, but on July 3, the legislature passed a concurrent resolution authorizing the state bureau of agriculture to make an exhibit, guaranteeing the expenses to be paid by the state.</p>
                            <p>This in brief is the substance of the work accomplished by the directors to the present time.</p>
                            <p>One of the provisions of the by laws is that a vice president shall be elected from each state, the governor of the state to recommend the party chosen.  In response to this provision, vice presidents have been elected for eleven of the twenty-four states and territories embraced in the Trans-Mississippi country, as follows: Thomas H. Wells of Hot Springs, S. D.; C. A. Fellows, mayor of Topeka, Kas.; George F. Wright of Council Bluffs, Ia.; C. R. Drake of Tucson, A. T.; William Neville of North Platte, Neb.; Gus Reymershoffer of Galveston, Tex.; Eugene Wallace of Oklahoma City, O. T.; George W. Parsons of Los Angelos, Cal.; R. P. Shawhan of Payette, Idaho; John Doniphan of St. Joseph, Mo., and William J. Westerfield of Reno, Nev.</p>
                            <p>This article would not be complete without mention of the men who took hold of the enterprise at a time when many of their fellow citizens looked upon the venture as one of doubtful expediency, and when there was much hesitancy in assuming the burden the exposition was sure to entail upon the city; to say nothing of the feeling which was by no means trivial that success could not be secured.  These men are the present officers of the association, who devoted much of their time, holding weekly meetings and doing a great deal of other work without pay or hope of reward other than that coming of a consciousness of loyal service to the city of which they form an important part.</p>
                            <p>First of these is Gurdon W. Wattles,
                            <figure><head type="sub">J. E. MARKEL.</head></figure>
                            president of the board of directors.  He was born in Southern New York, May 12, 1855, and came west when a young man, finishing his education at the agricultural college in Ames, Ia., after which he taught school for a while.  He soon engaged in financial enterprises, and organized the First National bank at Carroll, Ia.  July 1, 1892, he came to Omaha, and entered the Union National bank, of which he is now vice president.  During these years in the west he has been also western agent of
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="207" xml:id="TMISB01-207"/> -->
                            
                            the Rochester Loan and Banking company, one of the largest financial institutions in the east.  Mr. Wattles is not an orator, but his experience as president of the board of directors has shown that he is considerable of a public speaker, as he has been called upon many times and in many places to talk about the exposition, and has always done so with credit to himself and advantage to the subject he handled, being thoroughly familiar with the work, and being able to say what was needed in a concise and interesting manner.  He assumed the duties of the position against his judgment, but has shown an interest in it since that deserves the appreciation of every citizen of the city.</p>
                            <p>Dan Farrell, jr., was born at Newark, N. J., September 20, 1856, came west and attended Knox college at Galesburg, Ill.  He was appointed by President Hayes as assistant paymaster in the navy, and was stationed at the Washington navy yard on the ironclads Montauk and Wyandotte, and the torpedo boat Alarm.  In 1891 he was transferred to Yokohama, Japan, and later was made assistant in charge of the naval storehouse at
                            <figure><head type="sub">JOHN H. EVANS.</head></figure>
                            Nagasaki, and while there visited all the open ports in Japan, and at Shanghai, China, and at Fusan, Korea.  Upon returning from this assignment he resigned the position, and came to Omaha in 1887.  The present manufacturing and refining business was begun under the firm name of Farrell &amp; Welsh, employing three men.  He afterwards bought out Welsh, and organized as Farrell &amp; Co., he owning the entire business, which now employs 167 people, besides having fifteen traveling men and forty brokers, being the largest plant of the kind in the United States.  He also owns and operated his own car line by which is shipped all the produce used in the factory.</p>
                            <p>The only disappointment about George H. Payne as a director is his age&#8212;not that this fact is a discredit, but that it is a surprise to those who know the man.  He was born at Galesburg, Ill., October 6, 1864, and will therefore not be 32 years old till next fall.  He came to Omaha in 1884, and entered the office of the O. F. Davis company, loan agents, as a clerk.  He remained there several years, and in 1891 was made president of the Fidelity Trust company, which place he now holds.  He has been schooled to a business life, and has always been active in everything pertaining to the city's welfare.</p>
                            <p>C. S. Montgomery, a member of the board, and also its attorney, was born at Juneau, Wis., July 25, 1851, and came to Omaha in 1879, after spending six years at Lincoln, and is at present the senior member of the law firm of Montgomery &amp; Hall.  He graduated from the literary department of the state university at Madison, Wis., in 1872, and from the law department in 1873.  He is the only member of the board susceptible to the charge of being in any way a politician, and it would be <choice><sic>be </sic><corr></corr></choice>difficult for him to prove that in the light of his activity in later years, when he has given all his attention to his business.  He is the only lawyer on the board and his professional services
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="209" xml:id="TMISB01-209"/> -->
                            
                            have been called upon many times, all of which he has given freely and without charge.</p>
                            <p>J. E. Markel may be termed the Nestor of the organization.  He was born in Missouri in 1845, and realizing early in life that he would have to hustle for his bread, he did a very natural thing by learning the baker's trade.  He was in St. Louis at the beginning of the war and enlisted in 1861, but owing to poor
                            <figure><head type="sub">W. R. BENNETT.</head></figure>
                            health at that time, did not remain in the service very long.  He engaged in boating on the Missouri river, and while in that occupation came to Omaha in 1866 and remained here.  He started his business career here in a fruit stand, then branched out in the grocery business, and later established a bakery.  He served a few years as chief of the local fire department.  He became employed in the hotel department of the Union Pacific Railroad company and is today manager of that department.  With his son, Pryor, he also owns and operates the Millard hotel in this city, and the name of the firm is always seen on worthy subscription papers for a generous sum.</p>
                            <p>Charles Metz is another feature of the board.  He is the only native Nebraskan in the organization.  He was born at Bellevue, February 1, 1861, and came to Omaha three years later.  When 18 years old he entered the employ of the Metz Bros. Brewing company, and is today the general manager and heaviest stockholder in that institution, the output of which last year was 26,000 barrels.  He belongs to the younger class of Omaha's business men, and he actively co-operates in everything tending to build up and benefit the city.</p>
                            <p>I. W. Carpenter was born in McHenry county, Illinois, October 10, 1856, and lived on a farm till 19 years of age, when he went to Chicago and entered a wholesale paper house, where he remained for eleven years.  He came to Omaha in 1887 and organized the Carpenter Paper company, being its president, an establishment doing business in a greater portion of the Trans-Mississippi country.  Owing to ill health Mr. Carpenter sought to resign his directorship last spring, as he was going to the coast for an indefinite period, but the board gave him a leave of absence instead, and between times, while not looking for health in California, he did much good work in that state for the exposition for which he received a vote of thanks from his co-laborers on the board.</p>
                            <p>H. A. Thompson was born in Keene, N. H., July 20, 1848, and it may be said that he has been literally raised in the dry goods business.  He unhesitatingly
                            
                            <pb n="208" xml:id="TMISB01-208"/>
                            
                            admits that he hasn't a vast amount of information out of his line, but he will doubtless know a great deal about expositions before he gets through with his present service as a directors of this enterprise.  He went into a dry goods
                            <figure><head type="sub">H. A. THOMPSON.</head></figure>
                            store as an employe when 13 years old, and spent seventeen years in one store, and three years in a wholesale establishment.  With C. C. Belden, under the firm name of Thompson &amp; Belden, he began business for himself in Fremont, O., and after two years at that place, the firm came to Omaha in 1886, opening at 1319 Farnam street.  In 1890 the business was moved to the present commodious quarters in the Y. M. C. A. building, and is one of the most popular dry goods houses in the west.</p>
                            <p>J. H. Evans is another member who presents a feature aside from his many business connections.  He is the only one not an American citizens by birth.  He first saw the light of day in North Wales, December 12, 1848.  He came to this country in 1866, and engaged with his father in the tanning business at Racine, Wis.  He came to Omaha in 1878, and purchased an interest in a steam laundry, and in 1888 organized the J. H. Evans Steam Laundry company, of which he is principal owner.  Since that time he has organized five other laundry companies  in Omaha, Lincoln, South Omaha and Council Bluffs.  He is president of the Nebraska Shirt company, with a store at 1515 Farnam street, the largest shirt factory west of Chicago.  He is president of the Drummond carriage company, president of the Southern Land and Improvement company, made up of fifty of Omaha's citizens, and president of the National Bank of Commerce.  He is a director and members of several other local business organizations
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="209" xml:id="TMISB01-209"/> -->
                            
                            which indicates his interest in the city's affairs.</p>
                            <p>W. R. Bennett was born in Little Falls, N. Y., May 10, 1868, and began his business career in Chicago in 1875, where he remained two years.  He came to Omaha in 1878 and organized the present firm of the W. R. Bennett Co., being now its president.  The original firm began business at 113 North Fifteenth street.  The business was enlarged each year until it was found necessary to move to the present location on Capitol avenue, where half a block is occupied and the house is known all over the west.  Mr. Bennett is president of the Omaha Fair and Speed Association, and is a director in the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben.  In commission western parlance he is known as a hustler, and it was in accord with the eternal fitness of things that he should be selected as a director of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith is the only unmarried man on the board.  He was born in Missouri and says he is proud of it.  Savannah is his native town, and the family bible gives September 27, 1856, as the date of his birth.  He came to Omaha in 1888, and is president of the Steele-Smith Grocery company.  He was also for a long time connected with Nave, McCord &amp; Co., at St. Joseph, Smith, McCord &amp; Co., at Pueblo, Colo., and president of the Wyeth Hardware and Manufacturing company at St. Joseph.  He is always connected with every enterprise as a public character in Omaha.  He is a director in the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, and named the organization; and is a director of the Omaha Fair and Speed Association.  He was a delegate from Nebraska to the Trans-Mississippi congress and deep water convention at Galveston,
                            <figure><head type="sub">CHARLES A. METZ.</head></figure>
                            Tex., in 1891, and Governor Crounse appointed him a delegate to the same congress at Sam <unclear reason="torn"/> in 1893.  Upon his return from this mining he advocated the Trans-Mississippi exposition in conversation with some business men of the city at the Commercial club.  He was again a delegate to the congress at its session in this city last year, and was a member of the committee of five appointed to draw up the resolution locating the exposition at Omaha.  From this is will be seen that Mr. Smith has been associated with the exposition from its very inception.</p>
                            <p>John A. Wakefield is secretary of the
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="208" xml:id="TMISB01-208"/> -->
                            
                            board, as any organization in this city to be au fait must have him in that position.  His mission in life is to be secretary, and his friends say he is qualified to be secretary of a Sunday school or one of the secretaries in the cabinet.  He was born in Allegheny City, Pa., December 3, 1851, and lived in that state till 1876, when he went to Rock Island, Ill., and engaged in the lumber business.  He came to Omaha in 1880, and entered the wholesale lumber field.  He is also secretary of the Omaha Fair and Speed association.</p>
                            <p>Herman Kountze, treasurer of the exposition company, was born in Pennsylvania, August 21, 1833, and came to Omaha in 1856, engaging in the real estate business with his brother.  In 1857 they went into the banking <choice><sic>bueiniss</sic><corr>business</corr></choice> under the name of Kountze Brothers, and later organized the First National bank, the first bank organized in Nebraska under the national banking law.  Some years after this Mr. Kountze was elected president of the bank, which position he holds today.  He has been actively identified with the financial history of the city and state for forty years, and has also been associated with his brothers in banking business in other cities, particularly in New York, where the firm of Kountze Brothers ranks among the first of the many substantial banking houses of the metropolis.</p>

                            <p>Dr. McGillycuddy, president of the school of mines at Rapid City, S. D., and Prof. F. C. Smith, a member of the faculty, were in town during the week.  They

                            are both enthusiastic over the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  The first named gentleman has, of course, more than a state reputation, and both have many friends in Omaha.  There were other

                            Rapid City people in the party on their way to attend the republican convention at Aberdeen.  They were all united in wishing the enterprise a success and willing to do anything in their power to

                            see the plans materialize.  The doctor said something like this:</p>
                            <p>"We all believe in the future of the west.  The exposition will do much for the Trans-Mississippi country.  Every state west of the great river should take an interest in what promises so much for them all.  I am quite sure that South Dakota will make an appropriation and that the state will be creditably represented in Omaha.  We think we have a great state north of you.  The mineral wealth along will produce a great exhibit, if properly handled.  The Black Hills country is rich and resourceful and will surely be to the front in an advertising scheme of this kind.  If the state should see fit to make an appropriation, it is quite that the school of mines will have an individual exhibit.  At any rate I feel certain that South Dakota will display considerable interest in the exposition.  Then we have something besides mineral wealth to exhibit to the world."</p>
                            <p>It might be added incidentally that Dr. McGillycuddy is mayor of Rapid City.</p>

                            <p>"We haven't thought a great deal about the exposition in Sioux City yet," said C. Bevan Oldfield, a banker of that town, at the Millard the other night.  "It seems to us a good way off at this time.  When the time comes for making our show, I do not doubt but that the whole state will be interested.  So far, the western part of the state, near the river, has displayed most of the enthusiasm.  Personally, I think the opportunity is a splendid one for every state in the Trans-Mississippi country.  Our corn palace down in Sioux City did us lots of good and attracted a good many strangers.  This exposition will attract hundreds where our show attracted one, and I hope thousands.  If we only get a great big crop in 1897-98, it is my opinion we will be again in clover.  With a fine yield of grain over the states, the country will look beautiful to the visitors.  One thing," added Mr. Oldfield, "we will show those eastern people that we are not stone broke yet, and clear up a great many false impressions which they have

                            of the west.  It will undoubtedly be a success and will attract tremendous crowds of visitors."</p>

                            advocates of the exposition.  His sentiments briefly expressed are:</p>
                            <p>"The Trans-Mississippi should mean much for Utah.  It is a new state with its record as a state all to make.  Full of resources, both agricultural and mineral, it is destined to be one of the greatest of western commonwealths.  At this time it is peculiarly interested in the exposition, which is to be the greatest advertisement the west has ever had.  I believe the enterprise will succeed and am satisfied that it will result in untold good to those who participate with state and individual exhibits."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>"I do not believe the people of Omaha and Nebraska or any other western state can at this time conceive what enormous crowds of visitors will view the great show of 1898."  It was a gentleman heavily interested in Montana silver mines who spoke.  Although his home is in Butte, he is at home but once or twice a year, spending most of his time just now in Omaha.  "No, I do not believe the people at all comprehend what the magnitude of this enterprise really is.  Of course, the far sighted man does.  Why I know of one man in this city who is rich, one of the wealthiest in Nebraska, who has never to my knowledge given a dollar to build up Omaha.  He is ready to put up $5,000 right now on this exposition.  Don't you believe it?  Well he knows, as everybody else does, that he will get his money back with good interest.  It is merely an investment for him and he couldn't find a better one just now.  Talking about the crowds that will be here, all the people who have a curiosity to see a wild western town will come this way in droves.  A good many imagine that wild Indians do the war dance right in the middle of the streets of Omaha.  For those people I think you ought to corral a few Indians and keep them on exhibition.</p>
                            <p>"Will Montana be here?  Ah, yes, you can count on that.  The greatest mines in the world are in the Bonanza state.  Montana was at the World's fair with her famous silver statue of Ada Rehan.  You can be sure that she will do something original at the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  Our state has something besides silver ores and cattle to exhibit to the world, remember.  We have large areas of irrigated lands improving all the time.  The state will not miss this opportunity of showing up its resources."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>An important meeting of the board of directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition was held yesterday afternoon at the Commercial club rooms.  The subject under consideration was the matter of ways and means for raising the $300,000 of stock subscriptions which had been decided upon at the meeting of the stockholders Friday as the amount which must be raised in order to insure the success of the exposition.  The directors met at 12:30 and discussed the matter informally while they ate lunch and when lunch had been disposed of a business meeting was held, which lasted all afternoon.</p>
                            <p>It was decided to classify the population of the city according to occupation and appoint a committee to call upon each line of business of classification and solicit subscriptions.  A city directory was called into play and all of the business houses, professional men, salaried men of every class, laboring men, mechanics and, in fact, every man, woman and child in the city was put under one or another of the several classifications, for which a committee was appointed.</p>
                            <p>After an animated discussion it was decided that the most effectual manner of getting at the large army of salaried people would be through the heads of the business houses or establishments in which the people are employed.  It was the consensus of opinion in the board that every person employed regularly should subscribe for at least one share of stock, the price of which is $10.  The blanks prepared for subscriptions to the stock provide that not more than 10 per cent of the amount subscribed shall be called during the year 1896 and not more than 60 per cent during the year 1897, the entire subscription being conditional upon $300,000 being subscribed.  Each share of stock entitles the subscriber to one vote in a meeting of stockholders.</p>
                            <p>It was also decided to put South Omaha in a class by itself for the purpose of raising subscriptions, and to do the same with Council Bluffs.  The stock yards and packing houses were also put in class by themselves.</p>
                            <p>Lucius Wells was designated as a committee of one to look after Council Bluffs, it being understood that the Twin city already has a finance committee, appointed for just such purposes, and it was expected by the directors that this committee would take the matter in hand without any further <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>The committee for South Omaha consists of Mayor Ensor, T. J. O'Neil and David Anderson.</p>

                            <p>All of the men named on these committees are earnestly requested by the directors to meet at the Commercial club rooms at 12:30 p. m., Monday, for the purpose of consultation and instruction.  Every man is urged to make it his especial business to be on hand promptly, as the time is getting very short and the directors desire to have the town thoroughly canvassed this week and the full amount of $300,000 subscribed.  It is expected that this can be done if every man will put his shoulder to the wheel and push it along.  Blanks for subscriptions will be provided at that time and a schedule will be agreed upon, including <unclear reason="torn"/>t which should be raised by the several classes.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the shortness of the intervening time, it will be impossible for the secretary to send out formal notices of appointment to the members of committees, and the only notice they will received will be through the papers.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MR. MERCER'S CAMPAIGN.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer is a gold man and it is entirely appropriate that he should be the nominee of the gold party.  He has been a hardworking congressman and in local matters has discharged his duties creditably.</p>
                            <p>The World-Herald cannot be accused of entertaining or showing any ill will toward Mr. Mercer.  We have given him credit wherever he has deserved credit.  But we must confess that some of Mr. Mercer's champions are carrying the thing a bit too far.  A local paper prints these two interviews:</p>
                            <p>"If Mercer is not returned," remarked Captain Palmer, emphatically, "the exposition, in my opinion, is a dead duck."</p>
                            <p>"In my opinion it will be an utter impossibility to hold the exposition in this city in 1898 if Mercer is not returned," said E. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>This is a very near approach to the ridiculous.  If the Trans-Mississippi exposition should be dependent upon one man it would be a very small affair.  The fact of the matter is that the success of the Trans-Mississippi exposition is dependent upon the co-operation of the Trans-Mississippi states.  If this great enterprise is to be affected at all by politics it will be the politics that indicates whether Nebraska is a Trans-Mississippi state or a door mat for the financiers of the east to wipe their feet upon.</p>
                            <p>If this great enterprise is to be affected by politics it will not be affected to advantage by the election of a goldbug to represent the Omaha district in congress.</p>
                            <p>It is more probable that the next house will be overwhelmingly for bimetallism.  In such a house Mr. Mercer would be like a needle in a hay stack.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer will be given credit for all the good he has accomplished, but he will also be required to defend the goldbug votes he has cast.  Upon one matter of importance to the Trans-Mississippi section&#8212;the 1898 exposition&#8212;Mr. Mercer, like Senator Allen, discharged his duty well.  But in the matter of the greatest importance to the Trans-Mississippi section Mr. Mercer lined up with Wall street.</p>
                            <p>The contest this year will be gold monometallism versus bimetallism.  Mr. Mercer will be defeated as certainly as the bimetallists of this district shall unite upon a capable man who will vote for Trans-Mississippi interests upon all questions.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer's zealous champions will do well to keep the exposition out of politics, else they will find themselves confronted with the question, "Why should the site of the Trans-Mississippi exposition line up with the site of Wall street?" or "Why should not the site of the Trans-Mississippi exposition line up with the Trans-Mississippi states upon whose co-operation, more than all else, depends the success of that exposition?"</p>
                            <p>These would be difficult questions to answer.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, July 8.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Omaha stands among the top notchers tonight, as a result of the clever presentation of its desire to entertain the international convention of Christian Endeavorers in '98.  Instead of waiting until tomorrow to hear presentation addresses, the board of trustees decided this morning to hear representatives of the cities inviting the convention in 1898 this evening at the Ebbitt house.  Fifteen minutes was allowed to Omaha, and the speeches made were of a kind to command attention.  The attractions of Louisville and Nashville were first heard.  Then Omaha came on.  Rev. Dr. Ware and George Wallace were selected to outline what Omaha would do for the convention, should that place be selected, and it is not too much to say that the trustees were generally impressed with the manner in which the representatives of the Gate City went about their work.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Ware consumed eleven of the fifteen minutes in a logical presentation of Omaha as the convention city of 1898, reviewing the different organizations which had united in invitation, including the letter from Governor Holcomb, the mayor and city council of Omaha, the Commercial club and the Transmississippi Exposition association, the Epworth league and the Baptist Young People's union, together with the pastors, mayor and many leading citizens of Council Bluffs and South Omaha.  He spoke of the spiritual needs of the west and how the convention would quicken religious thought, and then turned to 1898, as the great exposition year, stating that while Omaha might not stand on historic ground, it stood on sacred ground, sacred to many an eastern and southern home, by being trod by their own sons and daughters, who constitute the strength of Nebraska citizenship.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Ware was followed by Mr. Wallace, and for once the graybeards on the board of trustees were compelled to applaud this last speaker.  He had but four minutes but there never was more said and to the point in four minutes than George Wallace said on this occasion.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WALLACE WAKES 'EM UP.</head>
                            <p>There was snap and go about him, and he carried the trustees off their feet.  The moment he began talking a map of the United States was unrolled, upon which had been ruled in red lines half an inch wide the railroads entering Omaha, and he showed why the convention should go to the central west in 1898.  He spoke of the facilities for carrying vast crowds, which this convention would bring, and then in a graphic manner told of the ability of the Gate City to accommodate 50,000 people.  He pledged Omaha to raise the necessary amount to care for the convention, one-half of the amount having already been guaranteed.  Mr. Wallace followed this up with a recital of what the location of the Transmississippi Exposition meant for the central west, and reviewed what congress had done for the great enterprise.</p>
                            <p>"Eighteen ninety-eight," he said, "will be the great transmississippi year, and all eyes will be turned toward our city and all roads lead to Omaha.  Omaha will be upon every tongue, and we will be known the world over.  We invite you to come to the garden spot of our country, to the homes of your children, the land where your sons and daughters, the Johns, Henrys, Joes and Marys of your firesides in days of yore, have gone to make history of the great new country, the central west."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wallace was frequently interrupted by the applause of the trustees, and the hearty enthusiasm of his brief address has seldom, if ever, been equaled by the presentation of the claims of any city inviting a convention.  Many members of the board personally congratulated the speaker upon his presentation of Omaha's claims, and stated that he was on the right line.  Philadelphia, also a candidate, will have a hearing on Friday, not having arrived up to this time.</p>
                            <p>It is now thought the fight is between Louisville and Omaha, Nashville being out of the question on account of lack of railroad facilities.  The Nebraska delegation is enthusiastic over present conditions, and believes the convention will come to Omaha for '98.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BUSINESS TRANSACTED IN A HURRY</head>
                            <head type="sub">Only Required an Hour for Speeches and All&#8212;Congressional Delegates Instructed to Vote as a Unit.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>It took the republican county convention exactly an hour yesterday to select 112 delegates to the congressional convention.  They were unanimously instructed to vote for the renomination of D. H. Mercer.  The convention was one of the most harmonious and enthusiastic ever held in Douglas county.  There was only one name mentioned in connection with the nomination and the uninitiated observer would never have imagined that and different situation had previously obtained.  If there were any dissatisfactions remaining from the contest at the primaries they were not perceptible and from first to last not an inharmonious note was sounded.  It was an auspicious beginning of the congressional campaign and when the convention meets today its proceedings will be a mere ratification of the will of the three counties of the district, as expressed in the instructions to the delegates.</p>
                            <p>When the county convention met in Washington hall yesterday afternoon every delegate on the floor was for D. H. Mercer.  The Third ward delegates were the last to climb into the band wagon.  During the forenoon they got together and decided that it would be useless to oppose themselves to the rest of the convention.  Consequently they determined to cast their full vote in Mercer's interests.  During the interval while the delegates were arriving, the unsuccessful aspirants for Mercer's shoes lingered around the edges of the crowd and received the good humored chaffing of their friends with as good grace as possible.  Mercer's overwhelming victory at the primaries had settled all opposition and to hear the conversations going on in various parts of the hall one would think no such opposition had ever existed.</p>
                            <p>The delegates consumed some time in exchanging felicitations and it was 2:20 o'clock when Chairman John Lewis of the county central committee called the convention to order.  Secretary Lunt read the call, after which Chairman Lewis said:</p>
                            <p>"Gentlemen of the Convention:  The battle in the republican camp is over.  The overwhelming majority rolled up in the various wards of this city upon yesterday; the returns from South Omaha and the country precincts indicate the way the wind blows and settle the congressional struggle in our party.  Yesterday we followed the several banners of our own particular candidates.  Today, without regard to former allegiance, one and all, we gather about one banner, the banner of the republican party, which has inscribed upon it the three magic names, McKinley, MacColl and Mercer.  Under this banner, united and loyal, the republican party in this county will march on to magnificent victory in November next.  Out from the conflict of yesterday we come with no heartburnings, no enmities, with but one desire&#8212;the success of the entire republican ticket next fall.</p>
                            <p>"I have the honor of presenting as your temporary chairman, Hon. Charles J. Greene of the Ninth ward."</p>
                            <p>The applause was renewed when Mr. Greene was introduced and took the gavel.  In thanking the convention for the honor conferred Mr. Greene remarked that while the great interest in this campaign centered on the contest for the presidency, the composition of the next congress was even more important.  There had been a struggle in this county, but now that it was over all should be united and know no man except as a republican.</p>
                            <p>He called attention to the great issues that were to be decided.  "The democratic party was for free coinage, free trade and everything else that was free except free labor.  He arraigned the populist party and pointed to the riot and disaster that had followed its assumption of power in Illinois, Kansas and Colorado.  It had shown itself incapable of governing a state and still it aspired to govern the nation.  All these interests meant war on the republican party, its institutions and its policy.  The republican party stood for protection to American labor and industries and for the best financial policy that the world had ever known.  It was the best friend silver had ever had.  Up to 1873 there had been scarcely $8,000,000 of silver coined in the United States.  Since then the republican party had added nearly $600,000,000 to the silver coinage <unclear reason="cut off"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">MAINTAIN THE PRESENT SYSTEM.</head>
                            <p>"Was that an act of an enemy to silver?  The party was for bimetallism, but until that had been secured by international agreement it proposed to maintain the financial system under which we had prospered for thirty years.</p>
                            <p>"What it meant was that every dollar of the vast volume of money that circulated today, whether gold or silver or certificates, should be as good as any other dollar in the world."</p>
                            <p>The speaker followed with a strong portrayal of the weakness of the position taken by the free and unlimited coinage advocates.  He showed the unfairness of the proposition and indicated the manner in which the execution of their views would contract the currency and bring disaster to every interest of this country.  "Work was what the people wanted.  Was this to be provided by destroying the industries which afforded labor?  Would free silver or free trade give work to the American people?</p>
                            <p>"This was no new situation.  It had been confronted five times before in the history of this country and in each case had resulted in disaster.  The republican party had always been true to the people.  It had found the country in the midst of a civil war and had brought about peace within and without its borders.  It had found it in financial distress and left it in a condition of prosperity unparalleled in its history."</p>
                            <p>At the end of the chairman's address, the organization was completed by the election of B. C. Smith of the Sixth ward and W. A. Soussey of Clontarf as secretaries.</p>
                            <p>On notion of T. K. Sudborough, the list of delegates as received by the secretary were declared seated.  W. B. Taylor of the Fourth ward moved that a committee of seven be selected to name the delegates to the congressional convention.  An amendment to increase the committee to include one member from each ward and precinct was voted down, and the original motion prevailed.  The committee consisted of W. B. Taylor, T. S. Crocker, I. O. Rhoades, Frank K. Darling, T. W. Blackburn, E. C. Mayfield, South Omaha; W. R. Turner, Elk City.</p>
                            <p>R. W. Breckenridge of the Seventh ward offered the following resolution, which was received with cheers:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">INSTRUCT FOR MERCER.</head>
                            <p>"Resolved, That the delegates from Douglas county to the congressional convention to be held July 9, 1896, be and are hereby instructed to vote as a unit for the nomination of Hon. David H. Mercer for congressman from the Second congressional district."</p>
                            <p>John C. Wharton said that in one respect he was like David B. Hill.  Hill had a speech prepared to make at the Chicago convention, but had never gotten an opportunity to deliver it.  He, himself had a resolution which included Harry Brome's name, but it would have to be embalmed along with Hill's speech.  He seconded the resolution offered by Mr. Breckenridge.  Tom McVittie of the Third ward performed the same office in behalf of Mr. Cornish.</p>
                            <p>The resolution was adopted amid tremendous enthusiasm and there was a wild cry for Mercer as he entered the hall.  Mr. Mercer advanced to the platform, while the delegates applauded wildly.  Congressman Mercer said that in his opinion a public office was not a private snap.  The people wanted an official who attended to his business and was not out on dress parade three-fourths of the time.</p>
                            <p>It was not always an easy matter for a man to do his duty, but perseverance conquered all things.  He had endeavored to erase from his lexicon the word "fail" and his work was only commenced for the Second congressional district.  He stood on the republican platform now as in the past.  With reciprocity, protection and sound money, prosperity would return to this country.  If the tariff question was properly taken care of, the money question would take care of itself.  And with McKinley in the white <choice><sic>houe</sic><corr>house</corr></choice> the republican party proposed to accomplish that result.</p>
                            <p>Continuing, the speaker referred to the sentiment of standing up for Omaha and Nebraska that was becoming universal.  He vigorously urged home patronage and a determined effort to build up the industries of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>As Mr. Mercer concluded there were general calls for E. J. Cornish.  Mr. Cornish somewhat humorously accepted his position.  He remarked that when a boy he had always wanted to see how a chicken looked after it had been through a cyclone and he presumed that that was the reason why the delegates were anxious to see him.  He briefly pledged his allegiance to Mr. Mercer and gave way to Mr. H. C. Brome.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Brome responded, saying:  "I belong, like my friend, in the ranks.  I have always been found fighting in the ranks.  I have always been found fighting in the ranks.  I recognize every one has a right to be a candidate, but should understand the majority should rule, and when the will of the majority is determined to bow to its will.  The prosperity of the country is bound up in the republican party and it is due from us all to work for its success and for the election of its nominees.  If Mr. Mercer will do as well in the next two years as he has in the past four, I will be satisfied.  I do not say it in a spirit of flattery, but I do say that no man can assert he has not performed his duty."</p>
                            <p>The convention seemed to be disposed to listen to speechmaking and John L. Kennedy, W. F. Gurley, I. R. Andrews, J. W. Carr and H. G. Burbank were successively called for.  None of them responded, and a recess of five minutes was declared in which to wait for the report of the convention.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Christian Endeavorers from Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa are at present hard at work trying to capture the convention of 1898 for Omaha.  One of their principal points as to why Omaha should have the convention in 1898 is that during that year the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition will be held there.  There are several persons from the city of Omaha who as yet have not registered their names at headquarters.  So far it has been impossible to locate these people, for not even their names are known.</p>
                            <p>On Saturday evening the delegates from the states will hold receptions at their respective headquarters.  The most attractive quarters are those of the Nebraska delegation, located in the Fourth Presbyterian church.  South Dakota's are close to second place, as are likewise those of Iowa.</p>
                            <p>It will probably be settled some time tomorrow afternoon which city will have the convention in 1898.  The fight now lies solely between Omaha and Louisville, Ky.</p>
                            <p>Nearly everybody here is wearing a badge with "Omaha, 98," printed thereon.  At the present time everything looks favorable for Omaha, but still there might be a slip.  Some of the Louisville and Nashville people say that Omaha wants to hog it and to prove their assertion they point to the fact that a grand exposition is to be held in that place during the year 1898.</p>

                            <p>The following six persons arrived in this city today from Nebraska and registered at headquarters:  Jennie I. Scott, Edith A. Scott, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Scott of Hastings, and Mr. and Mrs. D. H. Basset of Tecumseh.  At the headquarters of the Iowa delegation the register showed the following names of persons residing in Council Bluffs:  Miss Lora Grass, Miss Mary E. Devol, William J. and Mrs. Julia R. Leverett, Mrs. C. H. Judson and Clarence Judson.</p>
                            <p>South Dakota has about as many delegates as has Nebraska.  The headquarters of the South Dakota delegation is located in the Gurley Memorial Presbyterian church.  The church has been handsomely decorated throughout, and those in charge are polite and anxious to assist the visitors in every manner possible.  Beautiful young ladies are stationed around the rooms to answer all questions asked of them by visitors, and as a result the church has one of the most complete information bureaus in the city.  Looking through the register of the South Dakotans the following names will be found:  Mrs. John, Jamie Ellis, Lottie S. and Helen Halley of Rapid City; Miss Blanche Metcalf, Mary V. and Helen Olmstead, Alice and Flora C. Phillips, and H. E. Brock of Sioux Falls; Miss Nellie I. Appleby and Miss Josephine Curtis of Parker; Harriet A. Brown and S. Lizzie Voorhees of Santee Agency; J. Baldridge of Iroquois; Harriet Babcock and F. E. Babcock of Bridgewater; E. D. Cassill of Hudson; Mary M. Cameron of Pierpoint; J. M. Lockard of Volga; Miss Lillian M. Fisher of Bryant; G. E. Lovell of Garner; T. G. Langdale of Clark; O. B. Slasson of Springfield; Miss Lizzie Smith of Miller; Alice M. Stover of Centerville; Walton W. Thorp and Mrs. C. S. Thorp of Britton; Mattie O. Wheeler of Vermillion; Stella M. Williams of Warner, and Carl L. Willis of Yankton.</p>

                            <p>A number of delegates are expected to arrive in this city tonight from Nebraska and Iowa.  One of the chief topics of conversation at the headquarters of the Nebraska delegation is the Omaha exposition.  Many delegates from other sections of the country assured the Nebraskans that they would be in Omaha in 1898 to see the exposition, whether the Christian Endeavor held its convention there or not.  At the headquarters of South Dakota it is said that the Revs. McCauley and Boughton of that state stopped off at a station en route to this city to marry several couples who applied for such service, but not succeeding in finishing the ceremonies in time, the train left without them.  They reached this city at about 6 o'clock this evening.  The name of the place they stopped off at was Bridgewater.  The couples they married beat them to this city by about fifteen hours' time.  One of the couples registered at headquarters today and gave the name of Babcock.  Neither one of the ministers could be found tonight, but at headquarters it was said that they feel cheap over the way in which the couples beat them to the city.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Enlargement of Trans-Mississippi Expo. Directory Will Be Considered</head>
                            <p>The stockholders of the Trans-Mississippi exposition will meet at the Commercial club this afternoon to consider the proposed amendments to the articles of incorporation recommended by the citizens' committee of twenty-five.  The principal one of these amendments is that proposing to increase the board of directors to not less than fifty.</p>
                            <p>Members of the present board and of the citizens' committee have been in frequent consultation with a view to reaching a conclusion on these points before the matter is brought up in the stockholders' meeting, that there may be as little discussion as possible.</p>
                            <p>If the proposed amendments are accepted they will go into effect at once, and it is possible that a portion of the directors will be elected at the meeting this afternoon, the others to be elected at some future meeting after a more general subscription to the capital stock has been secured.</p>

                            <p>The soliciting committees for the exposition held another very encouraging meeting yesterday.  They report great interest in the enterprise on the part of nearly all the people and a disposition to subscribe liberally, but there is a general desire to hold back to wait on the bankers and capitalists.

                            <p>The meeting of the South Side Improvement association of Omaha and the board of trade of South Omaha at the council chambers at South Omaha was a success so far as enthusiasm was concerned.  Speeches were made by Dr. Hanchett, John Rush, Mayor Ensor, T. J. O'Neil, David Anderson and others, all favoring the locating of the Trans-Mississippi exposition grounds at Riverview park.  It was stated that 1,200 acres can be had for the enterprise if desired.  One speaker claimed that the people living in that part of Omaha that lies south of the railroad tracks on a line running east and west with the Tenth street depot, together with South Omaha, comprised over half of the entire population of Omaha.  That if this part of the city should go hand in hand and work for a common interest, the exposition would be located where it should be, viz: Riverview park.</p>
                            <p>Another meeting will be held at National hall in Omaha during the coming week.</p>
                            <p>The committee on solicitation of subscription for the Trans-Mississippi exposition met with fair success yesterday.</p>

                            <p>In response to a call issued by the directors of Labor Temple for a mass meeting at which would be discussed plans furthering the interests of the Transmississippi Exposition nearly every union in the city was represented last evening.  The subject of the laboring classes being represented in the board of directors of the exposition was brought up at the last meeting of the Central Labor union and it was decided to take action in the matter by appointing a special committee headed by T. F. Sturgis to confer with the exposition directors on the subject.</p>
                            <p>After the meeting had been called to order last night, Secretary J. L. Laird of Central Labor union briefly stated the object of the mass meeting and T. F. Sturgis of the special committee then made an extensive report.  He had conferred with Secretary Wakefield of the exposition board and it was stated that under the present arrangements the body of which he was a member could not be increased beyond its number of eleven.  He, however, stated that under the articles of incorporation of the exposition company when the amount of $300,000 had been subscribed toward the fund for carrying out the enterprise, the present board of directors would be dissolved and another one of fifty should take its place.  This arrangement would allow of the admittance of more men to the board, and Mr. Wakefield was of the opinion that no objection would be made to this proposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sturgis, in concluding his report, suggested that a committee of five be elected from the labor unions of the city, and these in turn could appoint subcommittees for the work of canvassing the various organizations to which they belonged for funds for the exposition.  Secretary Wakefield was present and upon request outlined the progress of the exposition up to the present time, laying particular stress upon the fact that the outlook for its accomplishment was never brighter.  He concluded by saying that he thought every laboring man in Douglas county who was in the possession of a job should subscribe to at least one share of stock, and possibly two.</p>
                            <p>A recess was taken at the conclusion of Mr. Wakefield's address, and the enrollment of the members was then in order.  At its termination the proposition made by Mr. Sturgis that five men should be elected to take charge of the exposition's interests until such time as they might be regularly represented in the executive board was passed by a unanimous vote.  Mr. Wakefield and the reporters were then requested to vacate and the meeting went into executive session for the purpose of electing a committee.</p>
                            <p>The following committee was appointed:  H. E. Easton, Machinists' union; Robert McKennon, Carpenters' union; T. F. Sturgis, Typographical union; Julius Meyer, Musicians' union; B. P. Flood, Pressmen's union.</p>

It was arranged to meet at the Commercial club at 2 o'clock Monday to go to the depot with the reception committee that is to meet the special train of the Commercial Law league at the depot.  They will be escorted to the Millard, presented with the gilt souvenir badges of Ak-Sar-Ben and, as they register, will be asked to become honorary members of that mystic order.  Handsome souvenir invitations, bearing the crest of King Ak-Sar-Ben, two knights charging, armed cap-a-pie, will be presented to each visiting member of the law league and they will that evening witness an initiation in the second degree at the Den.</p>
                            <p>The twenty-second infantry band will furnish the music at the Den and there may also be present a number of officers from Fort Crook.

                            <p>City Treasurer Edwards thinks he can already feel the influence of the Transmississippi Exposition in the increased receipts of taxes.  Although it has been but a little over two months since the 1896 taxes were due, over 5,000 receipts have been issued.  This is half as many as were issued altogether in 1895.  The receipts of special taxes are equally encouraging and Mr. Edwards believes that the increased confidence thus indicated is very largely due to the prospects of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The north siders held a Trans-Mississippi meeting at Erfling's hall last night, Joseph Redman presiding.  John A. Wakefield was present and talked for a half hour upon the present status of the exposition project.  He gave a brief history of the enterprise since its inauguration and added that it was the purpose of the ways and means committee to have raised by Saturday night $300,000.  At the conclusion of his talk the subscription lists were circulated and considerable stock was taken by those present.  Later the meeting proceeded to organize itself into the North Side Improvement association, adopting a constitution, introducing a section which favored the location of the exposition at Miller park.</p>

                            <p>Mayor Ensor and Dave Anderson are circulating the subscription list for the Transmississippi congress and are meeting with wholesale satisfactory results.  The subscribers almost unanimously take either $50 or $30 worth of shares.  Close to $3,000 has already been subscribed, and yet but few of the heaviest property owners have been seen.  Each share gives the holder a vote in all matters of organization, and by the way we are subscribing it is believed that South Omaha will have considerable to say as to who will conduct arrangements and take charge of the affair.</p>

                            <p>The Sunday World-Herald of July 12, published at Omaha, Neb., a bright, newsy sheet, contains an article and <choice><sic>illstration</sic><corr>illustration</corr></choice> which are of interest to many New Brighton people.</p>
                            <p>The article referred to is "The Moving Spirit of the Exposition Project," it referring to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., during the autumn of 1898.</p>
                            <p>The project was started by a resolution offered by the Trans-Mississippi Congress last autumn by Hon. W. J. Bryan, candidate for President.</p>
                            <p>It is now in the hands of a board of directors and John A. Wakefield, a former New Brighton boy, is secretary of this board.</p>
                            <p>The World-Herald says of him: "John A. Wakefield is secretary of the board, as any organization of this city, to be au fait, must have him in that position.  His mission in life is to be secretary, and his friends say he is qualified to be secretary of a Sunday school, or one of the secretaries of the Cabinet."</p>
                            <p>Wakefield passed his boyhood days in New Brighton, and lived here until 25 years of age.  Even at that early age he was one of the enterprising citizens, was a member of the old New Brighton fire department, and also a player in the famous Resolute base ball club, that was the terror of the western end of the State.  He will also be remembered as a prominent member of the Goodwill marching club, a thousand strong, who followed Senator Quay through one of the memorable early campaigns.  He left here in 1876, for Rock Island, Ill., but in 1880 went to Omaha, and is a prosperous lumber dealer.</p>
                            <p>His friends here think his likeness in the World-Herald is a good one.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Soliciting Committees Meet and Report Progress.</head>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Exposition soliciting committees held a meeting at the Commercial club rooms last night, for the purpose of comparing notes and arriving at the general result of the work of soliciting subscriptions of stock.  Several of the committees were not represented, and a number of the lists were not turned in, those having them in charge stating that they had not been able to complete their work and would require further time in order to see all the parties assigned to them.  It was impossible to arrive at an accurate result of the work accomplished, but a rough estimate of the amount of stock subscriptions in sight placed the total at a figure something over $100,000.  The members of the committees present expressed themselves as highly gratified at the showing made, saying it surpassed their expectations at this stage of the proceedings.</p>
                            <p>The striking feature of the lists turned in was the comparatively large amounts subscribed by the men working for small salaries.  The employes in the Union Pacific freight house, for instance, the men who handle the freight, subscribed for stock to the amount of $1,030, while, by a curious coincidence, the men employed in the B. &amp; M. freight house subscribed almost exactly the same amount, namely $1,010.  The list circulated among the barbers and laundrymen contained subscriptions amounting to $4,590.</p>
                            <p>The lists turned in contained the subscription of only one bank, the Union National, but the showing was a good one, the total subscription from the bank itself, the officers and employes of the institution amounting to $5,030.</p>
                            <p>A general interchange of views was indulged in by all present, and suggestions were thrown out as to efficient methods.  It was decided to hold a similar meeting next Saturday evening, for the purpose of comparing notes, and in the meantime the several committees will continue their work.</p>

                            <head type="sub">RECIPROCITY AND THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>The investments in the stock of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition company are now being taken sufficiently to guarantee the success of the great enterprise.  The liberal investments of the Omaha Gas company, Frank Murphy, Frank Colpetzer, A. L. Reed and the Union National bank, amounting in the aggregate  to $30,000, show the confidence the representative men of Omaha feel in the exposition, which they realize is to be the beginning of a new epoch in the further development of the west.</p>
                            <p>The liberal action of these gentlemen should be an incentive to others equally wealthy to invest on the same progressive plan, and if need be, for larger amounts at once, to get the permanent work of the exposition immediately under way.</p>
                            <p>Omaha has set her heart on having the exposition and making it a success second only to the World's fair.  And unless the World-Herald is mistaken our people will not forget those who put their shoulders to the wheel and open their pocket books wide to push this enterprise forward in its grandeur.</p>
                            <p>The spirit of reciprocity is abroad in our midst.  Omaha will help those who help her.  Our business men, workingmen and manufacturers are now thoroughly and permanently united.  They know the strength there is in union.</p>
                            <p>At this juncture to be the friend of Omaha is to invest liberally in the stock of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition company at once and herald to the world that Omaha has promptly taken the amount of stock allotted as her share.  No better advertisement could be given the city.  It will place Omaha first in the estimation of investing capital.  It will draw the attention of the people all over the country, and it will be the signal to stimulate and invigorate every enterprise west of the Mississippi directly, and indirectly those east of the great river.  For the gentlemen who have invested so liberally, as well as those who have invested to the best of their ability, Omaha feels reciprocal and the future will show that Omaha esteems them as good citizens to whom she will be ready to extend substantial marks of the favor in which they stand.</p>
                            <p>Others will join these honorable ranks; it is possible they have done so at this writing, and it is earnestly hoped before the close of the week the investment for the full amount will be complete, and announced to the world that Omaha has begun the work of the great exposition.</p>

                            <p>Bryan himself, it is said, is now fully satisfied that the populists in the western states will support him under all circumstances.  In the south he thinks he can stand some defections among them, because the regular democratic <choice><sic>organiation</sic><corr>organization</corr></choice> is strong.  His plan from now on is to make free coinage of silver at 16 to 1 not simply the paramount issue, but the only issue, and to couple Sewall with himself as the exponent of that cause.  The populists who demand a full indorsement of their platform from him will be disappointed, though he may not take the trouble to specify what portions of it he disapproves.</p>
                            <p>The action of the silver convention in nominating Bryan and Sewall seems to be looked upon by Bryan's confidential advisers as the shrewdest move that was made toward forcing the populists to make terms.  While the silver convention in itself did not amount to much, the scheme was engineered in a way to insure the mining camp states for the Chicago ticket and to disrupt the populist organization in those states.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bryan said to-night that he did not <choice><sic>known</sic><corr>know</corr></choice> when the silver notification committee would wait upon him.  The idea of having Mr. Sewall come out to Lincoln to receive the notification finds favor.  It would help along in the spectacular campaign which Bryan intends to inaugurate by having the Chicago convention's notification take place in New York.  It is probable that Mr. Bryan will now hasten the date of the New York demonstration.  He will decide upon it just as soon as Chairman Jones and the other men who have been at St. Louis have been consulted.</p>

                            <p>ST. LOUIS, July 25.&#8212;The national committee of the silver party has issued the following address:</p>
                            <p>To the American People:&#8212;Inasmuch as it has been charged upon the national silver party assembled in St. Louis that we are a convention of repudiators, revolutionists and anarchists, we submit the following to the candid judgment of the people:</p>
                            <p>In our delegations are four veterans of our Mexican war, forty-nine ex-confederates and 196 army veterans of the late war.  Of the 731 delegates attending nine are prohibitionists, forty-nine are populists, 147 are democrats and 527 are republicans.  Under this composition of the convention we appeal to all true patriots, without regard to previous part affiliation, to vote for William J. Bryan for President, and Arthur Sewall for Vice President of the United States.  A result of their election will be the restoration of free coinage for silver on equal terms with gold, providing thereby a growing volume of money, which will tend to disseminate rather than the aggregate wealth, which will relieve the present profound depression and replace it with a wide prosperity.  We urge you to unite upon this ticket, as <choice><sic>you</sic><corr>your</corr></choice> sole hope of escape from the rigors of a grinding gold monopoly.</p>
                            <p>Ours is a poor man's campaign.  We therefore call for contributions toward legitimate expenses, the same to be sent to William P. St. John, treasurer, at 121 East Thirty-fourth street, New York City.  Contributions of $1 or more will be regularly acknowledged.</p>

                            <p>OMAHA, July 25.&#8212;The empire west of the Mississippi is on the eve of a boom.  The preparations for the Transmississippi and International Exposition are already attracting attention to the agricultural and mineral wealth waiting to be claimed by enterprise.  Western states and territories are giving pledges of hearty support, and from the east come many inquiries.  Eastern people are awakening to the enterprise of a section that can undertake so ambitious a display, and are seeking information about its resources.  There is increasing evidence from day to day that the tide of immigration and investment is being turned in this direction by the great exposition, and there is reason to predict this stimulus will continue to increase as progress is made.  The correspondence of the officers of the exposition indicates that the whole country is becoming alive to the enterprise of western states, and there are the brightest prospects of an inflow of capital and people to the favored region this side the great river.</p>
                            <p>The exposition is now a certainty.  This city has practically completed its contract with the United States government.  It has raised, or can see the way to raise, the share of the money for the fair which it pledged in order to get from congress an appropriation of $250,000.  The subscription papers have secured more than $50,000 during the last week.  The total has more than passed the halfway mark.</p>

The committee secured the passage of a joint resolution recognizing the exposition and authorizing the board of agriculture to arrange a complete and fitting display of the industries and products of the state.  This was better than a bill for a stated amount, as the board was anxious to do great things.</p>

                            <p>This was the beginning of the action on the part of the states for which the exposition is created.  Iowa came soon with a preliminary appropriation of $10,000, with the intention of increasing it at the session next winter.  Idaho showed anxiety to get a good position in the procession.  Its vice president was named by the governor with commendable speed.  Kansas took up the project.  California, always alert and enterprising, began at once the preliminary work and named a commissioner.  Arizona, Texas and Nevada saw in the scheme great opportunities to show their wealth and resources and sent men to the advisory board.  Oklahoma took a hand.  Missouri realized the necessity of sharing in the show.  South Dakota wanted a building of its own.  Nebraska was hearty in support of the plan of its metropolis and added an official representative.  All the others sent word of support and promises to have a voice in the fair, but at the end of the second month of real work the following states and territories have appointed the following vice presidents:</p>

                            <p>It will thus be seen that the transmississippi exposition is exactly what its name specifies.  It is going to be what the Atlanta fair was to the south and more.  It is the child of a resolution passed by the transmississippi congress, a body of representative men of the west which meets annually for the discussion of plans and methods for the improvement of the prairies and the development of the mines of the far west.  This congress has talked and discussed the matter in theory until the range of topics has been exhausted.  It decided to show to the world the glories of the west no longer in speeches and papers, but to make an actual exhibition of the things it had been orating over for years.  The members of the congress claimed that the west had never had a creditable exposition broader than the fairs given individually by the states.  They saw the tide of immigration stemmed and turned into the south, and there was necessity for a movement to renew the attention of settlers to the garden spots and fortunes which were yet free to all comers west of the big rivers.  Omaha was selected as the most central and the natural gateway to these gardens and fortunes, and at a meeting last November W. J. Bryan introduced the following resolution, which was the real start of the big plan:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi River, made at some central gateway where the world can behold the

                            <p>Resolved, That the United States congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a transmississippi exposition at Omaha during the months of June, July, August, September and October in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such states and territories in congress be requested to favor such an appropriation, as is usual in such cases, to assist in carrying out this enterprise.</p>

It was especially fortunate that the city and state had live men in the senate and house, and at once Senators Thurston and Allen and Congressman Mercer drafted a bill for federal support.  Senator Thurston was less <choice><sic>confidenn</sic><corr>confident</corr></choice> that his colleagues.  They were doubters, who argued it was too soon after the show at Atlanta, and should Omaha be favored it would also be only fair for the house to do the same by Nashville, already in the field for an appropriation for its demonstration.  Mr. Mercer did not propose to consider anything which had been done or anything which had been done or anything which was being proposed.  He was at the capital for Omaha and Nebraska, and that was all the concern he had as far as this particular matter was concerned.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen introduced a bill, and it was hung up in the committee on expositions, of which Senator Thurston was chairman, but finally got a favorable report.  It called for only $50,000.  Mr. Mercer did not like the delay, and he framed a second measure, calling for $250,000, with the proviso that the city should raise an equal sum.  It was a long fight and a hard fight, and the bill met the opposition of Speaker Reed on the grounds of economy.  Mr. Mercer and his friends were working day and night in its interest.  Before Mercer's determined efforts the opposition which had originally confronted the

                            <unclear reason="torn"/>ll began to disappear.  As the members were made to realize the importance of the enterprise and the benefits that it would bring to the entire transmississippi region, its opponents were won over until it became one of the most popular measures before the house.</p>

                            <p>But some difficulty was still experienced in getting a favorable report from the ways and means committee, and on April 10 Senators Thurston and Allen called up the senate bill, which had been held in the of securing the passage of the house bill, which

It was passed by unanimous consent, and as no other course was then open, it was decided to introduce the senate bill in the house.  President Wattles of the exposition association and Henry F. Wyman were in Washington at the time in the interests of the bill, and on April 20 Mr. Wattles appeared before the house committee, together with Congressmen Mercer, Andrews and Kem, and made a vigorous plea for the bill.  The report was present by Congressman Dolliver of Iowa on the following afternoon and placed on file for passage.</p>
                            <p>Omaha made a record for speed at this time which surprised the people at Washington.  The bill was passed in the house at 1:24 o'clock.  It took just sixteen minutes for the senate to agree.  The wise men had already had it engrossed, and it came to Speaker Reed at 3 o'clock.  He put his name to the document, and Congressman Mercer came from the President's room at 4:30 with the measure a law.  He wired to his constituency the good news, and Omaha felt

                            great joy over the good fortune.  There was a parade in which everybody in town took part, a banquet and speeches from all the orators of the Platte.  The fact that the government had ordered a suitable building, exhibits from its museums, arsenals, fisheries and various departments made the exposition a fact, and the workers at once started to raise the necessary guarantee.  A few men were only needed to direct the movement, as there at once appeared a general demand on the part of the people to join in the contributions.</p>

                            <p>This list comprised the original stockholders and formed the basis of organization under which all preliminary work has been done.  There were several mass meeting of citizens and a demand made that the board of directors of eleven, elected from this list, should be increased to fifty.  There was objection to this, since the enlargement of the board was to be made as soon as the stock should be increased from $10,000 to $50,000.  The board then made an offer that as soon as $300,000 should be upon the papers it would not only resign itself, but would elect a complete new board from the new list of stockholders.  This plan was one of safety, that no one selfishly interested in any of the proposed sites could get control of the stock and locate the fair with a view to his own profit.  It was acceptable and the work has been going rapidly along these lines.</p>

                                amended to make the stock $300,000, but this is only the minimum limit.  Omaha really expects to get $750,000 from its own people, from Douglas County and from the state.  There was never a more buoyant set of directors elected for any enterprise than the one chosen for this exposition.  It is their purpose, in view of the recent success of the appeal to the people, to have at least $1,000,000, including the government allowance, for expenditure before the legislatures of this winter shall have made the appropriations for their own exhibits in Omaha.  This city appreciates the opportunity which has come to it, and by its example it proposes to carry confidence to the other large cities of the west and to the states.  The board has frequent meetings and is already spreading literature over the country from the gulf to the Canadian borders and from the Mississippi to the Pacific.  It is believed the crisis has passed and that the real work of getting ready for the big show has begun.  This board is backed by the entire membership of the Commercial Club, the board of trade and all the capital of the town.  This is as far as the work has progressed, and it will be continued by the following officers until the stock shall all have been taken and the new association shall pick a new board:</p>

                            <p>Omaha is also proud of the fact that the medals and emblems of excellence for exhibits are to be made by the government at one of the mints.  The bill provides that all exhibits shall be admitted to the country free of duty, and is explicit on the matter of the part the United States shall take in the fair.  It orders that there shall be exhibited at the exposition by the government, from its executive departments, the Smithsonian Institution, the United States fish commission and the National Museum, such articles and material as illustrate the function and administrative faculty of the government in time of peace, and is resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate the nature of our institutions and their adaptions to the wants of the people; and to secure a complete and harmonious arrangement of such government exhibit a board shall be created, to be charged with the selection, preparation, arrangement, safe keeping and exhibition of such articles and materials as the heads of the several departments and the directors of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum may respectively decide shall be embraced in said government exhibit.  The President may also designate additional articles for the exhibition.  Such board shall be composed of one person to be named by the head of the executive department and museum and by the President of the United States.  The President shall name the chairman of said board, and the board itself shall select such other officers as it may deem necessary.</p>

                                is not merely one planned for Omaha and Nebraska.  It is to be of general benefit to all the region lying west of the Mississippi, comprising nineteen states and five territories.  Omaha was selected as the site because it is in the midst of a large population, and a circle, with a radius of 500 miles with it as the center, takes in much of the region most to be benefited by the show.  The line intersects and covers fifteen states east and west of the Mississippi and the Territory of Oklahoma.  The people living in these states and territory number 20,485,088.  East of this circle are Ohio, Pennsylvania,

                                New York, New Jersey and New England, having a population of 12,530,000, exclusive of the states and territories south and west of this limit.  These people comprise the "traveling public" to a large extent, and show to a certain extent the number of visitors that will be induced to visit the exposition and the west during the time it is held at Omaha.  One-tenth this number within the 500-mile circle would give an attendance of more than 2,000,000 people.  This indicates a greater number of visitors than any display ever held in the history of the west, with the exception of the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago.</p>

                            <p>Omaha has never considered the enterprise a local one or one in which it was to get all the good.  The moment the preliminary organization was effected and the government indorsed the plan invitations were sent to all the transmississippi states to join in the management.  The governors of several of them sent commissioners at once, and the Iowa legislature was ready with money at the start.  These commissioners are entitled to a vote in the board as soon as the new big board shall be chosen.  The executive plan will be arranged after the methods used at the world's fair.  The states are invited to build homes for their own products, and as each will be in competition with the other for immigration from the east and elsewhere there is expected to be a large and keener rivalry in exhibits then was displayed at the Chicago fair.  It is the first occasion of the kind in the west.  The <choice><sic>promotors</sic><corr>promoters</corr></choice> have already ceased comparing it with the Atlanta exposition and prefer to consider the Columbian show as its model.  They are encouraged to this by the flattering promises made by such hustling cities as Lincoln, Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Des Moines, Dubuque, Burlington, Davenport, St. Louis, Kansas City, St. Joseph, New Orleans, Galveston, Dallas, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Helena, Portland, Tacoma, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Denver.</p>

                            <p>There is yet much uncertainty as to the plans where the active work of construction shall be begun.  The government building is assured.  Nebraska will have one of its own.  Louisiana has practically ordered one for its use, with the board of agriculture instructed to go ahead and do what it considers essential for the proper representation of the cotton and manufacturing industries of the state.  Utah has pledged to have a great exhibit, holding the amount of its appropriation until it shall appear how much revenue the new state will have at its command.  South Dakota has land for the millions and wants several acres to show that corn up there grows as big as oak trees and the wheat as thrifty as underbrush in a slough.</p>
                            <p>Colorado, at first disappointed the Denver missed the realization of its hopes to have a western exposition, had given consent, and the papers out there are favoring a display of mineral wealth and farm products which will make Montana and Wyoming envious.  The latter two states have already been on the ground and discussed the necessities of a large representation, and their commissioners will ask their state legislatures for liberal appropriations.  California will probably build like it did at Chicago, save on a smaller scale, and Mr. De Young has already begun the agitation that an exposition could not have been located at a better point for the advantage of California than at Omaha.  This will break the journey of travelers from the east and after a rest give them courage to come the rest of the way to "the only real garden spot of this country," meaning thereby the state in which he thinks the sun not only sets but rises also.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles believes that the general plan of the exposition will follow the lines of the Columbian fair.  The plan of buildings will depend somewhat upon the site which shall be selected.  There will certainly be a building for art&#8212;not necessarily devoted to western products, but to loan collections from the best private galleries.  A great hall for manufactures is planned by the people of Omaha.  It will be used for exhibits like those shown in the similar building at Chicago.  A hail for transportation will show the changes which have taken place in travel beyond the Mississippi, even within the memory of the men planning the exposition.  One of the most interesting suggestions up to date is a building devoted to the Indians and their works.  There has never yet been arranged a complete and exhaustive show of this phase of American life, and the scheme is to make this very extensive.  The farming interests of the vast regions will also be housed under one roof.</p>
                            <p>Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Utah are anxious for a building for mining.  It is proposed to make this historical, as well as practical, and show the old processes with pan and flowing water, as well as the new ones, with electricity and all the modern inventions.  The government fish exhibit will be put under a separate pavilion, along with such similar exhibits as the states may decide to make.  The states from the south-west portion of the territory, which is responsible for the success of the enterprise, are arranging for room for cotton industries and

                            <head type="sub">There May Be a Midway.</head>
                            <p>It will thus be seen that for the first time in the history of the country there is a disposition to have a western exposition which shall benefit the west and show to the people of the great cities of the east the place to live is west of the Mississippi, where sun and rain bring good returns for labor.  The hopes are not visionary, since the smallest appropriation yet mentioned or discussed is the preliminary one of $10,000 from Iowa, which was merely a starter.  Other states are talking as high as $50,000, and the directors will be disappointed if the state appropriations this winter do not reach $500,000 as the aggregate amount.</p>
                            <p>There are already suggestions for a midway feature.  There is no desire to make the exposition too serious, and while the show will be largely educational and devoted to the promulgation of the greatness of the west, there will be abundance of lighter attraction.  The west can supply as interesting things as did the Orient for the Columbian exposition.  Camps of Indians, and life among the cowboys, representations of sodhouses and the other characteristics of the sentiment of the prairies would take the eye of the tenderfoot, as well as amuse the old hands who are familiar with such sights.  There are hundreds of ideas presented of this kind, and the trouble is not going to be to find features, but to find room for them.  It is nearly two years until the show opens its gates, and two years for Omaha men is as much as fifty for a Philadelphian.  They have started right in good season, and people going the other way had better keep off the trail.</p>

                            <p>To pick a site is the next serious problem that will confront the board.  This matter will be deferred until the fifty men from the new list of stockholders shall have been elected.  The trouble will not come over the absence of desirable grounds, but over the abundance.  Council Bluffs tried to be

                            dictator in this matter and name East Omaha.  Council Bluffs wanted this location because it is nearer to its own postoffice than is Omaha.  At one time the acceptance of this site was made the price of the support of the town across the river, but the threat was not heeded, and Council Bluffs was as loyal in support as it could be.  This is what they would call a bluff in Missouri.  It raised the stock of East Omaha, but did not carry.</p>
                            <p>Miller Park is also available.  It is a fine stretch of land comprising seventy-eight acres.  It is within the four-mile circle and easy of access.  River View Park, at the other end of town, is wooded and the same distance from the postoffice.  It has sixty-four acres.  Neither of these two has room enough to accommodate all the plans already discussed.</p>
                            <p>The last and most favorable site is the state fair grounds and Elmwood Park.  These two are adjoining and comprise together 364 acres.  The park is filled with trees and capable of beautiful effects, and the fair grounds have building which could be used for the exposition with small alterations.  This site has so many advantages over the others that all indications are that it will be chosen without much opposition.  It is also within the four-mile limit and has street car and railroad connection with the center of town.  There is also a track and sheds for the live stock department, water and electric connections and many

                            <p>Secretary Wakefield is already overwhelmed with correspondence about the exposition and says he does not believe that ever in the history of the country was the west so heartily interested in anything as it is in this exposition.  In discussing the prospects he soars into the realm of eloquence and after picturing the glories of Omaha plunges on in a strain like this:</p>
                            <p>"Why, it is the biggest boom the west has ever had.  It is the first federal indorsement of this region since the country bought the Louisiana territory and cut it up to make a majority of the states which are to take part.  I tell you the idea has caught the entire western world and it has been indorsed by Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, California, Idaho, Iowa, Indian Territory, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.  They are all preparing to take an active part in the exhibition.</p>
                            <p>"Arkansas, along with its corn, wheat, cotton and varied fruits, will show its possibilities in rich minerals, gypsum, marble, granite, grindstone, porcelain clay, coal and hot spring water.</p>
                            <p>"Alaska will give an idea of its fish and fur industries, and display facts about its

                            <p>"Colorado will exhibit samples of its gold, silver, copper, coal, salt, iron, limestone and salubrious climate, and prove by the products of its irrigated lands that it is in the procession also as an agricultural state.</p>
                            <p>"California will expose the riches of its matchless mines and fruit farms, and give detailed accounts as to how the eastern moneyed man or immigrant homeseeker can increase his prosperity and enjoy life in the golden state.</p>

                            <p>"Texas, one of the cotton states, with its wooded lands and immense prairies, its numerous and rich farm products, minerals and manufactories, will attract attention of the multitudes.  The field in this state for the cultivation of ramie is waiting to be developed.</p>
                            <p>"Iowa, one of the queen states of husbandry, will be here in all its well-earned glory to give evidence of her enormous agricultural wealth, further capabilities and general desirability.</p>

It, with the banner of health and progress wrapped about itself, will bid the sisters welcome to the festal board, and talk about its half million milk cows, 100 creameries and annual $12,000,000 worth of butter, its annual corn crop of over a hundred million bushels, its high standing in literature, wonderful climate, enormous cattle industry, public lands, stock raising facilities, sugar beet factories, manufactural possibilities and general advantages.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles is equally as confident and believes this marks the beginning of a new era in the west.  It will be the first opportunity for the west to show itself and for the west to prove the assertions it has been making.  He already sees the grounds selected, the buildings built and all the eyes of the country turned to Omaha and the transmississippi exposition it made possible.</p>

                            <p>John Powers called the meeting of the Southside Improvement club to order last night for an exchange of views on the exposition question.  There was a large attendance of South Omaha citizens.  The regular business of the club was dispatched with and everybody turned loose on the exposition question.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Hanchett was first called upon, but he gave way for E. C. Lane of South Omaha, who said that he was much interested in the question, and that South Omaha people considered themselves as southsiders and had mutual interests with the southsiders of Omaha.  The location of the exposition is of vital interest to every South Omaha citizen, and he went on to show how the location of the exposition on the southside would increase the number of houses in South Omaha and it would fill up the gap between the two towns, making one continuous city.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Lane spoke at some length upon the volume of business transacted daily in South Omaha, to illustrate the importance of the town and where it would derive benefit from the location of the exposition in the southern part of Omaha.  He ended by saying that South Omaha was willing to unite with the southsiders in insisting on the location of the exposition on the southside.</p>
                            <p>David Anderson, also of South Omaha, spoke next and he told of the beauties of Riverside park and its surroundings, where the southsiders want the exposition located.  He didn't think that there was a more beautiful place within fifty miles of Omaha, and the drainage was perfect and the water plentiful.  He promised the support of South Omaha in working for this location.  Mr. Anderson advocated combining all people living south of Farnam street and all the people of the southern suburbs and he also advocated subscribing stock without stint.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Hanchett arose to say that he was much interested in the exposition and its location, and he was heartily in favor of Riverview park as the place.  Dr. Hanchett vividly described the beauty of the park and its environments and said it was finer than anything in the Black Hills.  The park is located geographically in the center of population and it is the easiest point of access by the street cars of any in the city by extending them a few blocks.  He paid a compliment to South Omaha and the hustling abilities of her people and said he hoped that the location of the exposition at Riverview park would be the link that would unite Omaha and South Omaha into one great city.  In concluding his remarks, the doctor said the grounds would be permanent for great gatherings for all time.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Dougherty was called for and he arose from his chair and said that Riverview park was the most beautiful spot around Omaha and that he was heartily in favor of the park being the location for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>John Rush said there would certainly be a strong opposition against the Riverview park site just as there has always been opposition against any improvement south of the Chinese wall, otherwise the Union Pacific tracks.  Mr. Rush spoke enthusiastically of the beauty of the site as a place that charmed the eye and elevated the mind and he expressed as his opinion that there was no other place in or about Omaha that offered so many inducements as Riverview park.  Mr. Rush called the attention of the reporters to the fact that the southsiders made no fight against any other site; they were for the benefit of the city and state and all they asked was a fair hearing of their claims and if after listening to their claims if they decide against them they will say, "God bless you and success."  The success of the exposition is what they are after and are working for.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MUST BUY THE STOCK.</head>
                            <p>Editor Rosicky of the Pokrok Zapadu spoke next and said that the first step was liability in buying stock, thus giving them votes and every cent subscribed will come back a hundred fold.</p>
                            <p>Isaac S. Haskell said there was no question of the desirability of the site, but what was wanted was a proposition from the owners of the adjacent land for the opposition because no buildings can be built in the park, or at least only a very few.  He thought Tom Murray ought to put in his share of the land for nothing considering how much it will enhance his property, and he thought it was the duty of those who are heavily interested financially in Omaha to give big sums and he expressed himself as opposed to sending away from Omaha for men to manage the exposition, lay out the grounds and erect the buildings.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Glasgow of South Omaha arose, but he gave away to Mayor Ensor of South Omaha, who came in with several councilmen.  Mayor Ensor said that they were right with the southsiders in this movement, both in contributions and enthusiasm and that Riverview park was their choice.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EVERY ONE WILL HUSTLE.</head>
                            <p>City Attorney Montgomery of South Omaha said that he understood that the object of the meeting was to organize to hustle for the Riverview site and South Omaha was with them.</p>
                            <p>Attorney Walkup spoke in favor of the site and then C. S. Elgutter came forward and said he favored the appointment of a committee to look up propositions for land.  He said South Omaha was a power and that the combined efforts ought to get the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Joseph Breen of South Omaha said that everybody in his town favored Riverview park and he said that if he had his way only a man who had a share of the stock in the exposition would be given work on its construction.  His statement that a petition would be circulated in South Omaha this week for signatures, the petition to be sent to the street railway company asking for transfers from the South Omaha line to the Thirteenth street line at Vinton, so the South Omaha people could go to Riverview park.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.</head>
                            <p>This ended the speaking.  A motion of Anton Kment was carried for the appointment of a committee of ten from South Omaha to join the regular committee of the Southside Improvement club to look after land adjoining the park, subscribers and all necessary arrangements for pressing the claims of the site.  The committee selected is composed of Ed Johnston, Mayor Ensor, E. C. Lane, Dr. Glascow, John Carroll, W. B. Vansant, J. H. Bulla, J. J. Breen, T. J. O'Neill and Thomas Hoctor.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TO INTEREST OTHERS.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Lane said that it would be a good scheme for this committee of the whole to appoint a sub-committee to visit Council Bluffs and have a meeting and get a committee from Council Bluffs to meet in the park and go over the site and this will be done.</p>
                            <p>A vote of thanks was extended the South Omaha citizens for their attendance and words of cheer.</p>
                            <p>The meeting concluded with several vocal selections by the South Omaha pickaninny quartet, brought up by Mayor Ensor.</p>

This is a most important matter to South Omaha. and all are urged to attend the meeting and give it as much weight as possible.  The South siders are hustling like beavers in the enterprise and will no doubt be successful if assisted by the people of this city.  A large number have promised the mayor, who is actively interesting himself in every movement looking to the location of the exhibition near the city, to attend, and he believes over a hundred of our citizens will attend tonight's meeting.</p>

                            <p>Lima, Mont., Aug. 6.&#8212;This morning the Omaha excursion party divided up and called upon at least fifty leading business men of Butte and presented the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  There was but one sentiment, that Montana will do her part and will be in the front rank of western states in the exhibition of her wonderful resources.  Ex-Senator Saunders said to the delegation: "There is no question but that Montana will respond liberally when the time arrives."</p>
                            <p>The special representatives appointed by the executive committee of the exposition association and every member of the party put in a hard day's work.</p>
                            <p>Among other business men called upon were the Anaconda Copper and Mining company.  This is the long list of names: Pat Mullen, Thomas Courtney, John Caplice &amp; Co., J. Ross Clark company, Orton Bros., Stewart Music company, J. H. Leyson, B. E. Calkins, Siegel Clothing company, Connell company, Hennessy company, Babcock &amp; Co., Pramman Dry Goods company, S. W.

                            <p>At the meeting last night of the South Side Improvement club an interesting discussion of the Trans-Mississippi exposition was indulged in.  Preparations for the vigorous pushing of the claims of the South Side people for the location of the grounds at Riverview park came up.  The following is the new committee appointed to work with this end in view:  Charles Kauffman, chairman; Isaac Haskell, Dr. Hanchett, John Powers, Krank Kaspar, W. H. Redfield, F. K. Darling, Anton Kenicut, W. W. Bingham, Nels Jensen, Fritz Miller, Carl Stephen, A. E. Walkup, George J. Stryker, John Rush.  The committee will hold the first meeting Thursday night in the office of Mr. Kauffman, 1302 Douglas street.  The club will meet every Monday night instead of every two weeks until they have accomplished their object, which is securing the location of the exposition for the South Side.</p>

                            <head type="sub">OMAHA TO THE FORE.</head>
                            <head type="sub">League Wheelmen Made a Strong Bid for 1898.</head>
                            <p>Seven wheelmen of the Omaha '96 Meet club returned from Louisville, Ky., yesterday, tired out, but satisfied with the good time that the club had since leaving Omaha one week ago last Saturday night until their home-coming as the vanguard of those who saw the meet through from start to finish.  The others are scattered about over the eastern states or at Mammoth Cave, and will be home later in the week.</p>
                            <p>As to the time at Louisville&#8212;it was one continual round of pleasure, made so by the southern hospitality, the lively program, and, most of all, the big standing that the Omaha club won by its hustling.  Omaha was strictly in the push, and on every excursion or gathering of wheelmen always came in for cheers.  The Omaha crowd was known everywhere, and always led "de gang" through perilous places.  And there wasn't a wheelman who left Louisville without an Omaha badge, and the promise given that he would vote for Omaha for the national meet in 1898.</p>
                            <p>Beginning last Monday, the members of the club began working individually around headquarters, buttonholing the new arrivals as soon as they registered, pinning badges upon them and telling them all about the beauties of Omaha and the great Trans-Mississippi exposition.  This work lasted through the smokers and everywhere else until Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>Then it was that the club did its prettiest work.  In the grand parade in the afternoon, in which at least 5,000 wheelmen were in line, Omaha showed up with a uniformed club under Captain Mulhall, led by little Eddie O'Brien, the club mascot, with a full Ak-Sar-Ben suit, and with a handsome maroon silk banner carried on a gaily decorated wheel by W. C. Bouk.  The uniforms were all of spotless duck, with white flannel caps trimmed with Ak-Sar-Ben colors, and black stockings with Ak-Sar-Ben golf tops.  It was concededly the swellest appearing aggregation in the parade, and was greeted with applause along the riding line for miles to Iroquois park.  And then the club, in all of its glory, rode back to the city in the same manner.</p>
                            <p>That evening the Omaha club gave a reception at the Louisville hotel parlors, which was spoken of by the Louisville papers as the most brilliant affair of the week.  General invitations had been extended to all League of American Wheelmen members, and then, early in the evening, a committee made a round of the Louisville and Gault hotels and the League of American Wheelmen headquarters, and extended personal invitations to the swell crowds at those places.  So more than a thousand ladies and gentlemen were entertained by the Omaha wheelmen, who received in uniform.  There was a fine orchestra, great bowls of rich sweet punch and lemonade, other refreshments for the gentlemen provided for by the generosity of the Omaha brewers, and no limit to the sandwiches and cakes.</p>
                            <p>The reception was in charge of President D. J. O'Brien, who did some valiant work in bringing about its success.</p>
                            <p>That showed that Omaha meant business, and everybody was more than satisfied with her ability to entertain.  So it was like fun to convince the wheelmen that the meet in 1897 ought to go to New York or New England, and that in 1898 to the western city of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Another big card played about that time was by F. W. Fitch and W. A. Messick in attending the business meeting of the Kentucky division of the League of American Wheelmen which was the only state meeting held, and there representing the claims of Omaha.  As a result, the Kentucky division of 1,200 members unanimously indorsed Omaha for the national meet in 1898, the resolution being presented by Hon. W. W. Watts, and carried with a rush.</p>
                            <p>Those returning yesterday were A. H. Ruf, J. E. Howe, Harry Mulhall, Fred Guldner, H. W. Howell, A. D. Fetterman and Fred S. Inches.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Northsiders Urge it for the Exposition Site.</head>
                            <p>At the meeting of the Northside Improvement club at Erflinger's hall last night, but little business was transacted.  Louis Littlefield, chairman of the committee detailed to confer with the Council Bluffs people in reference to supporting the Miller park location for the Transmississippi Exposition, reported progress.  He said several of the committee had talked with parties in that city in connection with getting up a mass meeting in order to discuss the subject.  They were to make a report in a few days and the future action of the club would be guided accordingly.</p>
                            <p>In case a meeting in the Bluffs should be called, the Omaha delegates who were down for speeches would go over there in a special motor train and explain at length the advantages of the Miller park location.</p>
                            <p>John Wigman, chairman of the committee having in charge the subscriptions to the exposition stock, stated that he had taken a trip to Florence and had met with fair success among the townspeople.  He suggested that it would be a good plan for the members of the committee to make a canvass from house to house in the northern portion of the city for the purpose of raising funds, and this was discussed at length by those present.  The subject was referred to the executive committee of the club, which meets at the Commercial club rooms Friday evening.</p>
                            <p>J. Y. Craig, having in charge the drafting of maps which will show the advantages of the Miller park location as regards railroad facilities and its proximity to the central portions of the city, submitted several sketches, which were approved by the club.  Blue prints for general distribution will be made of one of the sketches.  The club adjourned to meet at Erflinger's hall next Monday evening.</p>

                            <p>The finance committee of the Council Bluffs committee of thirty-five, having in charge the work of preparing for the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition in this city, have met and discussed the matter of stock subscriptions.  The plan agreed upon is to divide the city into districts, each district to be solicited by a committee appointed from the committee of thirty-five.</p>
                            <p>The importance of Council Bluffs subscriptions for exposition stock arises from the fact that Council Bluffs desires to secure the location of the exposition in East Omaha.  The location will be decided, as the business of other stock companies is done, by a vote of the stock, and the amount of influence Council Bluffs will have in the matter will depend purely upon the amount of stock sold here.</p>
                            <p>Another meeting is to be held Tuesday.  Saturday the advocates of the Miller tract as an exposition site are expected to be here to present the advantages of that location and to enlist the support of Council Bluffs for it as a second choice.</p>

                            <p>It appears that there is less than $40,000 of stock remaining and it is expected that the whole amount will be taken in Council Bluffs.  The stock is payable as follows:  Ten per cent the first year, 60 per cent the second year and the balance the third year if called for.  It is expected, however, that the last 30 per cent will probably not be needed.  Members of the committee who spoke expressed the opinion that those taking stock would receive back their investment with a substantial return in profits.  The districts and committees are as follows:</p>

                            <p>George F. Wright said in relation to the East Omaha site that the East Omaha Bridge &amp; Terminal company had positively refused to give any assurances that its bridge and motor line could be used by 1898, and when informed that under those circumstances Council Bluffs would oppose the selection of the East Omaha site, had simply replied that they were very sorry.  The Omaha and Council Bluffs Bridge &amp; Railway company is, of course, opposed to the East Omaha site, but has declared that it will throw not a straw in the way of the selection of that site if it shall be deemed best.</p>

                            <p>&#8212;The South Side Improvement club, Monday night, appointed a committee to solicit subscriptions of stock for the exposition among the residents of the First and Second wards.  It was pointed out that with a most liberal subscriptions list the south siders could ask with more confidence for the location of the exposition at Riverview park than otherwise.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Question of Location to Be Ignored Until Funds Are Promised for the Transmississippi Affair.</head>
                            <p>The Council Bluffs committee of thirty-five held a long and earnest discussion last evening of the plans for raising about $40,000 of stock subscriptions to the Transmississippi exposition.  The meeting was held in one of the upper rooms of the city building at Council Bluffs.  Nearly all of the members were present.  Chairman Wells presided and E. W. Hart acted as secretary.</p>
                            <p>The necessity for prompt action was impressed upon the members by the announcement that the stock books would be closed September 1 and the statement in the Omaha evening papers that only $39,000 of stock remained to be taken was referred to.  The question of location was the subject for contention.  All of the members favored East Omaha, but it was generally understood that the only way Council Bluffs could hope to have any voice in the matter was to be found in an argument backed up by a big stock subscription, which should not be less than all remaining unsubscribed.  George F. Wright stated that no arrangements could be made with the East Omaha Bridge company by which the use of the bridge company that in the event of its continued refusal Council Bluffs would oppose the East Omaha site.  The motor company did not favor the site on account of the loss of patronage it would entail, but had promised not to oppose the wishes of the city.  Wright also stated that every man in Omaha who had subscribed to the stock had a location to advocate.  When the committee got down to real work and begun the preparation of the soliciting committees the plan was proposed and adopting of dividing the city into districts and appointing committee for each district and separate committees for each class of business and professional men.  The result was the appointment of the following committees:</p>
                            <p>Committee to solicit implement men, W. W. Loomis, F. R. Davis, H. H. Van Brunt; wholesale house and manufacturers, William Moore, F. H. Hill, F. H. Keys; physician and professional men, Dr. M. Treynor, Macrae, jr., T. c. Dawson, A. T. Flickinger, Dr. Hanchet and George S. Wright; horticulturalists and gardeners, J. P. Hess, J. F. Wilcox, Alex Wood; postoffice employes and clerks, Fred Johnson, Fred DeGroat, W. C. Unthank; hotels and restaurants, original finance committee of nine; county, city and Unite States officials, A. S. Hazelton, R. H. Bloomer, George F. Wright; bankers, original finance committee; traveling men, Charles Edwards, E. P. Johnson, William G. Dorland, R. J. McBride, H. E. Coffeen.</p>
                            <p>Retail dealers, divided into six districts, as follows:  First district:  Main and Pearl from Broadway and Fifth avenue, H. W. Binder, F. J. Day, R. N. Ellis; second district, Fourth street, Main and Pearl streets and Sixth street from Fifth avenue to Sixteenth avenue, P. Gunnoude, Peter Smith, T. B. Hughes, J. W. Palmer; third district, Broadway from Main to Eighth street, C. B. Randlett, E. A. Troutman, J. P. Greenshields; fourth district, Broadway from Eighth street to the river, L. M. Shubert, W. C. Boyer, J. F. Hunt; fifth district, Broadway from Main street to Park avenue, C. S. Byers, A. Whitelaw, M. Wollman, sixth district, Broadway east from Park avenue, L. A. Casper, Victor Jennings, Dell G. Morgan.</p>
                            <p>The stock is divided into shares of $10 each.  Not more than 10 per cent of it will be called for this year, not more than 60 per cent next year, and the remainder the third if it is needed.  Each subscribers to the stock will be furnished the stock he agrees to take, with the certainty that he will get back a large portion of the original cost, if not all.  The Midwinter exposition in California netted the stockholders $68,000 above par value, and the investment proved to be a profitable one.</p>
                            <p>Every member of the committees appointed is requested to meet at the city building this evening for the purpose of completing the arrangements for beginning work at once.  The meeting of the committees is of the utmost importance and there should be no absentees.  No excuses will be accepted for the absence of the chairman of each of the committees.  Several other committees will be appointed by the committee of thirty-five.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PRESIDENT WATTLES EXPLAINS DETAILS</head>
                            <head type="sub">First Assessment on Subscriptions Likely to Be Called For Within a Few Days&#8212;Other Routine Matters.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles was at Council Bluffs last evening and addressed the meeting of the subcommittees appointed to solicit stock for the Transmississippi Exposition.  He gave the members present a hearty talk upon the importance of getting to work promptly and working energetically.  He gave the committee some figures and estimates of what the exposition promised to be and to do for the people of the three cities&#8212;Omaha, Council Bluffs and <choice><sic>oSuth</sic><corr>South</corr></choice> Omaha.  The lowest estimate that had been placed upon the attendance during the six months the exposition would be open was 2,500,000.  It would cost these people at least $10 each day to stay long enough to see the big show, and this would mean the expenditure of $25,000,000.  The expenditure of this money would accrue to the interests of all.  He said that letters had been received from people at Atlanta, saying that the citizens realized $100 for every dollar they paid out for stock.  If this was the result at Atlanta where there was only a small white population to draw from and but a small number of weak states interested the results to be anticipated for the Omaha exposition must be as much greater as the territory to be drawn upon was greater and richer.  He said the immediate work was now to secure the subscriptions of stock.  Council Bluffs people, he presumed, were like the Omaha people and felt poor, but the only way to get out of a hole was to work out and not stay there and rot.  He explained how the selection of a site was to be made.  When the stock subscriptions were closed the stockholders would be called together for the purpose of voting for fifty directors, and these directors would select the site.  Every stockholder would vote as many shares as he owned, each share representing a vote.</p>
                            <p>Answering the question as to the location of sites most favorably talked of, he said that for obvious reasons he could not be expected to say much on the subject.  In fact, he knew as little as any person in the audience concerning that phase of the subject.  It was all problematical and the directors alone would decide it.  There were four site, he said, most talked of.  One was the southside site at Riverview park; another was the northside site at Miller park.  East Omaha had many advocates in all sections of the city and was looked upon very favorably by a great mass of the people.  The other site was at Elmwood park, adjoining the present state fair grounds.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles spent an hour answering questions and giving suggestions to the committees concerning their work of selling stock.  He said the big department stores in Omaha had given $5,000 each and the smaller ones $2,500.  The banks gave on an average $2,500, while the officers and employes gave enough more to foot up $5,000.  The street car company gave $10,000 and its officers and employes $17,500.  The letter carriers took from three to five shares of stock.  The smaller retail stores took from $100 to $500 worth of stock.  He advised against soliciting subscriptions from poor men and men holding uncertain positions.  He explained that the first assessment of 10 per cent would probably be called for within a few days, and certainly before the election of directors.  This was necessary to prevent boomers of sites running up a bogus subscription list for the purposes of influencing the directors.</p>
                            <p>He felt sure the committees need feel no hesitancy in assuring the stockholders that they would have returned to them the greater part, if not all, of the subscriptions and probably a premium.  He said there would be no waste of money and that no salaries would be paid to any persons except a few clerks.  The officers and the men whose brains would control and mould the great enterprise would take their pay in glory.</p>
                            <p>He also impressed upon the committee that their work of soliciting was not a work of charity, and he wanted them to get the people to clearly understand this fact.</p>
                            <p>The committee on motors and railways consists of George F. Wright, W. W. Loomis and Lucius Wells.</p>
                            <p>After the discussions were closed the chairmen of the various committees were given their subscription lists and ordered to get to work at 7 o'clock this morning.</p>
                            <p>The amounts fixed for each committee to raise was: Implement dealers, $4,000; wholesale houses, $3,000; professional men, $3,000; letter carriers and postal employes, $1,000; city and county officials, $2,500; traveling men, $1,000.  The remainder of the $40,000 is to be secured by the original finance committee of nine.  The committees adjourned to meet Friday evening at 8 o'clock.</p>

                            <p>Supporters of the exposition in Council Bluffs have gone to work in earnest to raise funds for the great enterprise.  The people across the way have a site in which they are very much interested.  They want the directory to consider their claims and this directory is soon to be composed of fifty men elected by stockholders.  Thus it is seen that the people of Council Bluffs must take stock in order to be on an equal footing with the advocates of other sites.</p>

                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha, June 1st to November 1st, 1898, is intended to exhibit particularly the products, resources, industries and civilization of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi river, embracing two-thirds of the area, one-third of the population and one-half the wealth of the United States, and, incidentally, the products, resources and industries of the other States lying east of the Mississippi river, and of foreign countries.</p>
                            <p>Since the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893 the belief has been prevalent throughout the great West that a comprehensive exposition, such as is proposed, held at some central point, would be of incalculable and lasting benefit to every State, Territory, and interest, within the Trans-Mississippi country.  California held its Mid-Winter Exposition &#8212; a State enterprise &#8212; at San Francisco, January to July, 1894.  Kansas City advocated the
                            
                            <pb n="241" xml:id="TMISB01-241"/>
                            
                            holding of a Mid-Continent Exposition.  Denver proposed a Western States Exposition.  Texas planned to have a Western and Southern States Exposition at Galveston, celebrating particularly the opening of deep water transportation from Gulf points.  Minneapolis and St. Paul advocated a Northwestern States Exposition at the Twin Cities.  Finally, the Trans-Mississippi Congress, composed of leading and representative men of all classes, professions and business interests of the States and Territories lying west of the Mississippi river, who assemble each year to discuss measures for promoting the commercial and material welfare of the trans-Mississippi country, at its meeting in 1895 discussed the value of such an exposition and unanimously adopted resolutions favoring the holding of a Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha in 1898, and requesting the United States Congress to take such steps as might be necessary to recognize and encourage the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>In pursuance of such action, and the general desire for such an exposition, the Commercial Club of Omaha took up the subject and called a public meeting, the result of which was a corporation, organized for the purpose of undertaking the exposition, and carrying the same to a successful conclusion.</p>
                            <p>The "Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition" is a corporation organized under the laws of Nebraska, with an authorized capital stock of one million dollars.  The articles of incorporation require a board of fifty directors, by whom the enterprise will be conducted.  It is also provided that there shall be a vice-president for the exposition in each of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, who will have a share in the management and direction of the interests of the expositions; each vice-president to have particularly under his charge the interests and representatives of his own State.</p>
                            <p>Three hundred thousand dollars of the capital stock has now been subscribed by Omaha citizens and the work of the exposition will very shortly be taken up on a broad and liberal plan.</p>
                            <p>The United States Congress, at its last session, passed an act recognizing and endorsing the exposition, and providing for an appropriation of $200,000 for a United States government building and exhibit.  It is believed that at the coming session of Congress a further appropriation of $300,000 will be granted in order that the United States building and exhibit may be fairly representative of the interests of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories as part of the Nation.</p>
                            <p>The State of Iowa, at the late session of its legislature, made a preliminary appropriation for its representation at the exposition, and, at the adjourned session to be held in January, 1897, it is promised that further provision will be made, so that Iowa's participation in the exposition will be, at least, equal to that of any other State.</p>
                            <p>California citizens are greatly interested in this exposition, and steps have already been taken looking to an appropriation of $75,000 by the legislature of the State, to provide for the fullest representation of the products, industries, etc., of that great State at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The State of Louisiana, at its session closing July 9th, 1896, passed a concurrent resolution instructing

                            the State Board of Agriculture to arrange for and provide fitting, ample and adequate representation of the State at the exposition, and pledging the State to pay the expenses thereof.</p>
                            <p>Utah, Wyoming and Colorado have pledged their States to large and full representation at the exposition, and from correspondence with representative citizens of other States of the Trans-Mississippi territory, it is practically assured that twenty, at least, of the twenty-four States and <choice><sic>Territorries</sic><corr>Territories</corr></choice>, will be fittingly and largely represented.</p>
                            <p>The great Trans-Mississippi country, with its vast undeveloped resources, should not hesitate in at once acting so that all the industries, products and capabilities of this great section will be fully, fittingly and amply represented at the exposition.  To that end it is the desire of the organization that each of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, through their respective legislatures, will arrange for such appropriations and representation as may be necessary to properly exhibit their resources and products.</p>
                            <p>States east of the Mississippi river, and foreign countries and nations, are cordially invited and requested to participate to an unlimited extent, and every facility will be granted for their exhibits.</p>
                            <p>Organization is earnestly requested and correspondence invited, and aid solicited in making this exposition a complete success.</p>
                            <p>Omaha was selected as the place at which this exposition will be held because of its central location, convenient alike to the people of the East, the West, the North and the South, and by reason of the vast systems of railways centering at this point, extending to all parts of the continent, its salubrious and genial climate, and the well-known enterprise of its people.</p>
                            <p>That Omaha is in the midst of a large population occupying a territory of great wealth, is proven by drawing a circle having a radius of five hundred miles, of which this city is the center.  This line intersects and covers fifteen States east and west of the Mississippi River and the Territory of Oklahoma.  The people living in these States and Territories number, according to the census of 1890, 20,485,088, an increase of 5,262,159 in ten years.  They possess an aggregate wealth of $23,576,586,897, an increase in the same period amounting to $10,008,586,897.</p>
                            <p>No opportunity has ever been offered the great West to advertise its resources, products and capabilities to the world, equal to that which this exposition will afford.</p>
                            <p>A cordial invitation is extended to all gatherings, conventions, assemblies, reunions and other meetings to convene at Omaha in 1898.  Ample assembly halls and accommodations will be provided for all such meetings.</p>
                            <p>On account of the exposition greatly reduced rates will be made by all railways centering at this point, and the exposition will afford an interesting means of entertainment for all delegates in attendance at such meetings.</p>

                                <p>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha, June 1st to November 1st, 1898, is intended to exhibit particularly the products, resources, industries and civilization of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi river, embracing two-thirds of the area, one-third of the population and one-half the wealth of the United States, and, incidentally, the products, resources and industries of the other States lying east of the Mississippi river, and of foreign countries.</p>
                                <p>Since the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893 the belief has been prevalent throughout the great West that a comprehensive exposition, such as is proposed, held at some central point, would be of incalculable and lasting benefit to every State, Territory, and interest, within the Trans-Mississippi country.  California held its Mid-Winter Exposition &#8212; a State enterprise &#8212; at San Francisco, January to July, 1894.  Kansas City advocated the

                                    holding of a Mid-Continent Exposition.  Denver proposed a Western States Exposition.  Texas planned to have a Western and Southern States Exposition at Galveston, celebrating particularly the opening of deep water transportation from Gulf points.  Minneapolis and St. Paul advocated a Northwestern States Exposition at the Twin Cities.  Finally, the Trans-Mississippi Congress, composed of leading and representative men of all classes, professions and business interests of the States and Territories lying west of the Mississippi river, who assemble each year to discuss measures for promoting the commercial and material welfare of the trans-Mississippi country, at its meeting in 1895 discussed the value of such an exposition and unanimously adopted resolutions favoring the holding of a Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha in 1898, and requesting the United States Congress to take such steps as might be necessary to recognize and encourage the enterprise.</p>
                                <p>In pursuance of such action, and the general desire for such an exposition, the Commercial Club of Omaha took up the subject and called a public meeting, the result of which was a corporation, organized for the purpose of undertaking the exposition, and carrying the same to a successful conclusion.</p>
                                <p>The "Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition" is a corporation organized under the laws of Nebraska, with an authorized capital stock of one million dollars.  The articles of incorporation require a board of fifty directors, by whom the enterprise will be conducted.  It is also provided that there shall be a vice-president for the exposition in each of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, who will have a share in the management and direction of the interests of the expositions; each vice-president to have particularly under his charge the interests and representatives of his own State.</p>
                                <p>Three hundred thousand dollars of the capital stock has now been subscribed by Omaha citizens and the work of the exposition will very shortly be taken up on a broad and liberal plan.</p>
                                <p>The United States Congress, at its last session, passed an act recognizing and endorsing the exposition, and providing for an appropriation of $200,000 for a United States government building and exhibit.  It is believed that at the coming session of Congress a further appropriation of $300,000 will be granted in order that the United States building and exhibit may be fairly representative of the interests of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories as part of the Nation.</p>
                                <p>The State of Iowa, at the late session of its legislature, made a preliminary appropriation for its representation at the exposition, and, at the adjourned session to be held in January, 1897, it is promised that further provision will be made, so that Iowa's participation in the exposition will be, at least, equal to that of any other State.</p>
                                <p>California citizens are greatly interested in this exposition, and steps have already been taken looking to an appropriation of $75,000 by the legislature of the State, to provide for the fullest representation of the products, industries, etc., of that great State at the exposition.</p>

                                    <p>In behalf of the people of Nebraska, I take pleasure in cordially endorsing the invitation which will be extended to the association to hold the convention of 1898 at Omaha.  On numerous occasions our State's metropolis has shown its ability to care for great gatherings, and I feel assured that if the Letter Carriers will come to Omaha, they will find a warm welcome.  Unexcelled railroad facilities, ample hotel accommodations and the enterprise of her wide awake citizens make Omaha an ideal convention city.</p>

                                <p>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha, June 1st to November 1st, 1898, is intended to exhibit particularly the products, resources, industries and civilization of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi river, embracing two-thirds of the area, one-third of the population and one-half the wealth of the United States, and, incidentally, the products, resources and industries of the other States lying east of the Mississippi river, and of foreign countries.</p>
                                <p>Since the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893 the belief has been prevalent throughout the great West that a comprehensive exposition, such as is proposed, held at some central point, would be of incalculable and lasting benefit to every State, Territory, and interest, within the Trans-Mississippi country.  California held its Mid-Winter Exposition &#8212; a State enterprise &#8212; at San Francisco, January to July, 1894.  Kansas City advocated the
                                    
                                    <pb n="248" xml:id="TMISB01-248"/>
                                    
                                    holding of a Mid-Continent Exposition.  Denver proposed a Western States Exposition.  Texas planned to have a Western and Southern States Exposition at Galveston, celebrating particularly the opening of deep water transportation from Gulf points.  Minneapolis and St. Paul advocated a Northwestern States Exposition at the Twin Cities.  Finally, the Trans-Mississippi Congress, composed of leading and representative men of all classes, professions and business interests of the States and Territories lying west of the Mississippi river, who assemble each year to discuss measures for promoting the commercial and material welfare of the trans-Mississippi country, at its meeting in 1895 discussed the value of such an exposition and unanimously adopted resolutions favoring the holding of a Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha in 1898, and requesting the United States Congress to take such steps as might be necessary to recognize and encourage the enterprise.</p>
                                <p>In pursuance of such action, and the general desire for such an exposition, the Commercial Club of Omaha took up the subject and called a public meeting, the result of which was a corporation, organized for the purpose of undertaking the exposition, and carrying the same to a successful conclusion.</p>
                                <p>The "Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition" is a corporation organized under the laws of Nebraska, with an authorized capital stock of one million dollars.  The articles of incorporation require a board of fifty directors, by whom the enterprise will be conducted.  It is also provided that there shall be a vice-president for the exposition in each of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, who will have a share in the management and direction of the interests of the expositions; each vice-president to have particularly under his charge the interests and representatives of his own State.</p>
                                <p>Three hundred thousand dollars of the capital stock has now been subscribed by Omaha citizens and the work of the exposition will very shortly be taken up on a broad and liberal plan.</p>
                                <p>The United States Congress, at its last session, passed an act recognizing and endorsing the exposition, and providing for an appropriation of $200,000 for a United States government building and exhibit.  It is believed that at the coming session of Congress a further appropriation of $300,000 will be granted in order that the United States building and exhibit may be fairly representative of the interests of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories as part of the Nation.</p>
                                <p>The State of Iowa, at the late session of its legislature, made a preliminary appropriation for its representation at the exposition, and, at the adjourned session to be held in January, 1897, it is promised that further provision will be made, so that Iowa's participation in the exposition will be, at least, equal to that of any other State.</p>
                                <p>California citizens are greatly interested in this exposition, and steps have already been taken looking to an appropriation of $75,000 by the legislature of the State, to provide for the fullest representation of the products, industries, etc., of that great State at the exposition.</p>
                                <p>The State of Louisiana, at its session closing July 9th, 1896, passed a concurrent resolution instructing
                                    
                                    <pb n="249" xml:id="TMISB01-249"/>
                                    
                                    the State Board of Agriculture to arrange for and provide fitting, ample and adequate representation of the State at the exposition, and pledging the State to pay the expenses thereof.</p>
                                <p>Utah, Wyoming and Colorado have pledged their States to large and full representation at the exposition, and from correspondence with representative citizens of other States of the Trans-Mississippi territory, it is practically assured that twenty, at least, of the twenty-four States and <choice><sic>Territorries</sic><corr>Territories</corr></choice>, will be fittingly and largely represented.</p>
                                <p>The great Trans-Mississippi country, with its vast undeveloped resources, should not hesitate in at once acting so that all the industries, products and capabilities of this great section will be fully, fittingly and amply represented at the exposition.  To that end it is the desire of the organization that each of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, through their respective legislatures, will arrange for such appropriations and representation as may be necessary to properly exhibit their resources and products.</p>
                                <p>States east of the Mississippi river, and foreign countries and nations, are cordially invited and requested to participate to an unlimited extent, and every facility will be granted for their exhibits.</p>
                                <p>Organization is earnestly requested and correspondence invited, and aid solicited in making this exposition a complete success.</p>
                                <p>Omaha was selected as the place at which this exposition will be held because of its central location, convenient alike to the people of the East, the West, the North and the South, and by reason of the vast systems of railways centering at this point, extending to all parts of the continent, its salubrious and genial climate, and the well-known enterprise of its people.</p>
                                <p>That Omaha is in the midst of a large population occupying a territory of great wealth, is proven by drawing a circle having a radius of five hundred miles, of which this city is the center.  This line intersects and covers fifteen States east and west of the Mississippi River and the Territory of Oklahoma.  The people living in these States and Territories number, according to the census of 1890, 20,485,088, an increase of 5,262,159 in ten years.  They possess an aggregate wealth of $23,576,586,897, an increase in the same period amounting to $10,008,586,897.</p>
                                <p>No opportunity has ever been offered the great West to advertise its resources, products and capabilities to the world, equal to that which this exposition will afford.</p>
                                <p>A cordial invitation is extended to all gatherings, conventions, assemblies, reunions and other meetings to convene at Omaha in 1898.  Ample assembly halls and accommodations will be provided for all such meetings.</p>
                                <p>On account of the exposition greatly reduced rates will be made by all railways centering at this point, and the exposition will afford an interesting means of entertainment for all delegates in attendance at such meetings.</p>

                                <head type="main">Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</head>
                                <p>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha, June 1st to November 1st, 1898, is intended to exhibit particularly the products, resources, industries and civilization of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi river, embracing two-thirds of the area, one-third of the population and one-half the wealth of the United States, and, incidentally, the products, resources and industries of the other States lying east of the Mississippi river, and of foreign countries.</p>
                                <p>Since the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893 the belief has been prevalent throughout the great West that a comprehensive exposition, such as is proposed, held at some central point, would be of incalculable and lasting benefit to every State, Territory, and interest, within the Trans-Mississippi country.  California held its Mid-Winter Exposition &#8212; a State enterprise &#8212; at San Francisco, January to July, 1894.  Kansas City advocated the
                                    
                                    <pb/><!-- <pb n="248" xml:id="TMISB01-248"/> -->
                                    
                                    holding of a Mid-Continent Exposition.  Denver proposed a Western States Exposition.  Texas planned to have a Western and Southern States Exposition at Galveston, celebrating particularly the opening of deep water transportation from Gulf points.  Minneapolis and St. Paul advocated a Northwestern States Exposition at the Twin Cities.  Finally, the Trans-Mississippi Congress, composed of leading and representative men of all classes, professions and business interests of the States and Territories lying west of the Mississippi river, who assemble each year to discuss measures for promoting the commercial and material welfare of the trans-Mississippi country, at its meeting in 1895 discussed the value of such an exposition and unanimously adopted resolutions favoring the holding of a Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha in 1898, and requesting the United States Congress to take such steps as might be necessary to recognize and encourage the enterprise.</p>
                                <p>In pursuance of such action, and the general desire for such an exposition, the Commercial Club of Omaha took up the subject and called a public meeting, the result of which was a corporation, organized for the purpose of undertaking the exposition, and carrying the same to a successful conclusion.</p>
                                <p>The "Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition" is a corporation organized under the laws of Nebraska, with an authorized capital stock of one million dollars.  The articles of incorporation require a board of fifty directors, by whom the enterprise will be conducted.  It is also provided that there shall be a vice-president for the exposition in each of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, who will have a share in the management and direction of the interests of the expositions; each vice-president to have particularly under his charge the interests and representatives of his own State.</p>
                                <p>Three hundred thousand dollars of the capital stock has now been subscribed by Omaha citizens and the work of the exposition will very shortly be taken up on a broad and liberal plan.</p>
                                <p>The United States Congress, at its last session, passed an act recognizing and endorsing the exposition, and providing for an appropriation of $200,000 for a United States government building and exhibit.  It is believed that at the coming session of Congress a further appropriation of $300,000 will be granted in order that the United States building and exhibit may be fairly representative of the interests of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories as part of the Nation.</p>
                                <p>The State of Iowa, at the late session of its legislature, made a preliminary appropriation for its representation at the exposition, and, at the adjourned session to be held in January, 1897, it is promised that further provision will be made, so that Iowa's participation in the exposition will be, at least, equal to that of any other State.</p>
                                <p>California citizens are greatly interested in this exposition, and steps have already been taken looking to an appropriation of $75,000 by the legislature of the State, to provide for the fullest representation of the products, industries, etc., of that great State at the exposition.</p>
                                <p>The State of Louisiana, at its session closing July 9th, 1896, passed a concurrent resolution instructing
                                    
                                    <pb/><!-- <pb n="249" xml:id="TMISB01-249"/> -->
                                    
                                    the State Board of Agriculture to arrange for and provide fitting, ample and adequate representation of the State at the exposition, and pledging the State to pay the expenses thereof.</p>
                                <p>Utah, Wyoming and Colorado have pledged their States to large and full representation at the exposition, and from correspondence with representative citizens of other States of the Trans-Mississippi territory, it is practically assured that twenty, at least, of the twenty-four States and <choice><sic>Territorries</sic><corr>Territories</corr></choice>, will be fittingly and largely represented.</p>
                                <p>The great Trans-Mississippi country, with its vast undeveloped resources, should not hesitate in at once acting so that all the industries, products and capabilities of this great section will be fully, fittingly and amply represented at the exposition.  To that end it is the desire of the organization that each of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, through their respective legislatures, will arrange for such appropriations and representation as may be necessary to properly exhibit their resources and products.</p>
                                <p>States east of the Mississippi river, and foreign countries and nations, are cordially invited and requested to participate to an unlimited extent, and every facility will be granted for their exhibits.</p>
                                <p>Organization is earnestly requested and correspondence invited, and aid solicited in making this exposition a complete success.</p>
                                <p>Omaha was selected as the place at which this exposition will be held because of its central location, convenient alike to the people of the East, the West, the North and the South, and by reason of the vast systems of railways centering at this point, extending to all parts of the continent, its salubrious and genial climate, and the well-known enterprise of its people.</p>
                                <p>That Omaha is in the midst of a large population occupying a territory of great wealth, is proven by drawing a circle having a radius of five hundred miles, of which this city is the center.  This line intersects and covers fifteen States east and west of the Mississippi River and the Territory of Oklahoma.  The people living in these States and Territories number, according to the census of 1890, 20,485,088, an increase of 5,262,159 in ten years.  They possess an aggregate wealth of $23,576,586,897, an increase in the same period amounting to $10,008,586,897.</p>
                                <p>No opportunity has ever been offered the great West to advertise its resources, products and capabilities to the world, equal to that which this exposition will afford.</p>
                                <p>A cordial invitation is extended to all gatherings, conventions, assemblies, reunions and other meetings to convene at Omaha in 1898.  Ample assembly halls and accommodations will be provided for all such meetings.</p>
                                <p>On account of the exposition greatly reduced rates will be made by all railways centering at this point, and the exposition will afford an interesting means of entertainment for all delegates in attendance at such meetings.</p>

                            <head type="main">GOSSIP OF THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>"Almost every man has an opportunity some time in the course of his life, which if improved, would lead him to what the world calls success," said a gentleman at the Paxton the other night.  "So has every town, village and city, the same 'flood tide' of affairs which may lead on to fortune.  The Trans-Mississippi exposition is Omaha's opportunity.  If successful, it will give it a leadership of the west which will afford the city unrivalled prestige.  For everybody knows that although the exposition is not a local affair and was never meant to benefit any exclusive locality, yet at the same time, the success of the enterprise depends in a great measure upon how it is managed from Omaha.  And if it is a success, Omaha will receive immediate and direct benefit.  The congress of Trans-Mississippians which met in Omaha nearly a year ago, selected this city as the most favorable site for the holding of the exposition and as having the right kind of citizenship to start it off in a strong, sure manner.  They had confidence that Omaha would see that the enterprise did not fail.  It thus regarded the 'Gate City,' as you call it, one of the foremost cities of the west.  And I have no doubt that Omaha will prove herself equal to the opportunity.  I have watched this city as it grew up from infancy, and the stuff that the leading men of Omaha are made of is evidenced by what they have made of Omaha in the past ten years in the face of many obstacles.</p>
                            <p>"In saying this, I would not in the least belittle the fact that the whole Trans-Mississippi commonwealth will be vastly benefited by such an exposition as this promises to be.  Coming after a season of financial depression (we hope it will be 'after'), it will give an impetus to the entire west that will rebound much to its permanent and substantial prosperity.  It will show up the 'new west' in a proper light.  People will get a more accurate idea of the prairie west, which many imagine is still run with buffaloes and Indians.  How much of an idea do you suppose a great many have of the finely irrigated farms and fruitlands of the west?  The exposition will be a great educator."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>"Times are pretty tough for getting up expositions," said Henry B. Thielson of Portland, Ore., at the Millard the other day.  "If the Trans-Mississippi exposition were to be held today it would stand a slim chance for success.  But two years will doubtless make a great change all over the country.  Oregon has never been very enthusiastic over expositions.  It had a small appropriation for the World's fair exhibit and even less for the midwinter fair.  And were the Omaha exposition to occur today it would give a very small contribution for an exhibit of its resources.  But all states are in that condition now.  If the tide of affairs turns, as it doubtless will, after election, I would not be surprised to see the state with a splendid show.  It is a grand young state with a variety of resources.  A display of its fruit, grains, lumber and stock would make a very creditable showing.  If times are not better in two years&#8212;well we wouldn't have any use for an exposition, any of us.</p>
                            <p>"I have no doubt that the enterprise is a commendable one," continued Mr. Thielsen, "it ought to be a good advertisement for the western commonwealth.  Such things always pay directly or indirectly.  The benefit may not be seen for some time, but it inevitably follows.  From all indications it would look as though two years would see us on a top wave again.  Hard times are always followed by good times.  This exposition, it would seem, will occur at about the right time to do lots of good.  One thing is certain up our way.  If anything is done by Oregon, Portland will bear the responsibility and do the rustling necessary to put the state right before the world at the exposition.  That city is to Oregon what Omaha is to Nebraska."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>"Omaha is making a gallant fight for the exposition, I see," said J. B. Rawlins of Los Angelos one day last week.  "If the exposition is at all possible your city will see it successfully through.  This is a day of expositions, it seems, and it looks to be the proper thing to call every little fair by the high sounding name of exposition.  But this Trans-Mississippi affair ought to be one of the biggest ever held in this country.  Think of the territory it covers and the immense amount of wealth it represents.  It's prairie and mountains are peopled by the most enterprising men on earth, too.  What they can't do when they undertake to accomplish could be done by no power on earth.  The western people are the aggressive, energetic people of this country.  They have learned in a rough school and have been under the <choice><sic>tutilage</sic><corr>tutelage</corr></choice> of hard old experience for many years.  They are the people who made states just as the old colonies were planted in the eighteenth century.  They are the people who can make a success of an exposition.</p>
                            <p>"Politics eclipses everything else for the present.  A presidential year is always a bad one in a business way, and this year is very apparently no exception.  But if times get better, as they must, each state will be eager to do its share toward making the success of the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  Appropriations will necessarily be small in some cases, but no state can afford to miss the opportunity to advertise its resources which the Trans-Mississippi enterprise affords.  It is purely a business proposition with them.  It is to be no show merely for the sake of state pride, but an investment which will pay nobody knows how much interest in years to come."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Large Amount of Exposition Stock Taken Conditionally.</head>
                            <p>The Transmississippi soliciting committee held a meeting at the Commercial club rooms last night to compare notes and report the result of the week's work.  After a conference it was found that the total amount subscribed was very close to the $300,000 required to be raised, but it was also found that at least $40,000 of the amount subscribed was so tied up with the conditions with which the committee had been unable to comply that the amount actually available was far from being sufficient to meet the requirements of the government appropriation.  These conditional subscriptions had no connection with any site for the exposition, but were hedged about with conditions of an entirely different nature.</p>
                            <p>The committee having charge of soliciting among heavy property owners and the corporations reported that several of the heavy capitalists and the railroad companies had positively refused to subscribe to anything until after election, the inference being that the result of the election would determine whether they would subscribe anything or not.</p>
                            <p>Among the subscriptions reported by the committees were the following:  Employes of the Union Stock yards and commission men in South Omaha, $5,090; employes of Hammond's packing house, $610; employes of Swift's packing house, $1,620; employes of W. R. Bennett Co., $1,260; employes of J. H. Evans, $2,290.</p>
                            <p>The committees adjourned for two weeks in order to bridge over fair week, and it was determined to make a strong effort in the meantime to close up the work before the next meeting.</p>

                            <head type="main">GOSSIP OF THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi exposition has been a common topic among the crowds of visitors who attended the state fair.  One could hear it almost anywhere.  It was generally conceded that a city which could do herself proud in the past week would make a success of the larger undertaking.  The splendid pageants, the great fair and the immense throngs of people all indicated that Nebraska with a strong united effort can accomplish even in the hardest times feats of which it has a right to be proud.  The fact that interest in the exposition is growing as time advances could be easily ascertained in a few minutes conversation about any of the crowded hotels.  The proposed event overshadows everything else excepting politics at present.</p>
                            <p>"The people of Nebraska are generally delighted with the prospect of the Trans-Mississippi exposition," said G. A. Luikart of Norfolk in the rotunda of the Paxton.  Mr. Luikart is president of a Norfolk bank and has an interest in several banks in other towns of the state.  "All over the state the eyes of the people are just now on Omaha to discover when the requisite subscriptions of stock shall be sold.  The interest in the event is unanimous and everybody wants to see it a success."</p>
                            <p>"In my mind," continued Mr. Luikart, "if the country gets a little more prosperous in the next two years, the exposition will certainly be a success.  And it means a great deal for Omaha and the west&#8212;the biggest advertisement the Trans-Mississippi country has ever had.  From recent travels in Illinois and other states I know there is considerable interest taken in the fact that the big fair is to be held in Omaha in 1898.  It will bring eastern capitalists to the Trans-Mississippi country in large numbers.  They will see its advantages as they have never been presented before.  Most of them will not be content with a trip as far as Omaha, but will seize the opportunity to go on further and see something of the west in general.  I am quite sure that the state will do its share in making it a success.  There is certainly lots of interest shown in it at present.  It is a great opportunity for the Trans-Mississippi commonwealth."</p>
                            <p>"It is to be the biggest thing that ever came to the Trans-Mississippi country," said Major Walker of North Platte, an old army man, well known in this and other states, and one of the early residents of Nebraska, now engaged in the business of stock-raising.  "Yes," added the major, "it will be a great big card for Omaha, Nebraska and Iowa especially.  Council Bluffs and Iowa ought to be as deeply interested in its success as Omaha and Nebraska.  And, in fact, all the western states are as much concerned in its success as the state which takes the initiative.  I think this exposition will draw immense crowds from the east.  It will start capital this way, and that is what is needed to develop the large resources of the Trans-Mississippi country.</p>
                            <p>"To illustrate the way the exposition is being talked about," Mr. Walker went on, "let me just refer to a little correspondence I have had with relatives of mine in the east.  I have received letters from them and friends in New York, Pennsylvania and other states, in which the writers spoke of a contemplated visit to be postponed until the time of the exposition, as that would be the best time to come west.  So it will be with a great many people.  They will make their plans just as they did for the World's fair and other great expositions to visit the big show.  With the proper enterprise shown, the event ought to be a splendid success.  It is what the people of the state are anticipating.  They believe that Omaha will make it succeed, and they think that in its success will be a great impetus to the west, after the long years of depression.  Election year is not a very favorable time for inaugurating such an enterprise, and things will come easier after next November.  The people will give their whole attention to it then who are apparently unenthusiastic at present."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Hon. George H. Roberts of Boise City, Idaho, was in the city during the week.  Mr. Roberts was a prominent citizen of Omaha thirteen years ago, and says he has now a warm heart for the "boys" and his "native hills."  Regarding the exposition, Mr. Roberts said:</p>
                            <p>"It is going to be the biggest thing that ever occurred in the history of the west.  I hope Omaha will secure it all right.  I understand that there is a little money to raise here yet, and I know that this city will prove equal to the task.  As for Idaho and our people of that state, we are interested in building up the country to which we are neighbors.  All of the northwest is more or less tributary to Omaha and shares its prosperity.  When it comes to state buildings and exhibits Idaho will not be found wanting.  It would only be a matter of duty for our state to make a large and creditable exhibit of its resources.  Why, we want to surprise you folks right here with a display of the kind of fruit we raise out there.  California and other famous fruit sections are simply not in it.  We not only want to show the people of Nebraska that we are a great state, but we want to convince easterners of the value of our fruit lands, and show them that there is something there besides gold and silver in the mountains and scraggy sheep upon the hills.</p>
                            <p>"Nebraska is a great state, and I shall always feel a great interest in it personally.  It is a state which can push such an enterprise as this to a glorious fruition.  The Trans-Mississippi exposition means much for the west.  It means that this commonwealth will show to the world a rich agricultural, fruit-raising country, vast areas of gold, silver, copper and coal mines, and states in which those of every avocation of life can find a sure avenue to success.  Coming at the time for which it is set, it will mark an epoch in the history of the Trans-Mississippi country.  After a period of unprecedented depression, hardship in many respects greater than that endured by the brave pioneers who first broke through the thickets and wildernesses of this country years ago, it will enter upon a new era of power and prestige.  I have a deep interest in the exposition, for I helped to break the first paths and trails over this vicinity many years ago.  Anything that I can do I shall shoulder with pleasure."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Their Attorneys Submit a Plan of Settlement.</head>
                            <head type="sub">FIGURES ON CITY TREASURY SHORTAGE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Proposition to Pay Over the Sum of $18,373.95 in Full of All Demands and Thus Avoid Litigation.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Acting under instructions, the attorneys for the bondsmen of Henry Bolln, the defaulting ex-city treasurer, have prepared the following, which they will submit to the city council at its next meeting, in settlement of the $115,000 shortage.</p>
                            <p>We are directed by our clients, the sureties upon the official bonds of Henry Bolln, formerly city treasurer of the city of Omaha, to make to your honorable body this statement and proposition for settlement:</p>
                            <p>There are a number of defenses to any action that may be brought upon the bonds, on which in case of suit, we will, of course, rely, and which we believe will be sufficient to discharge our clients entirely from liability.  We believe that the bondsmen for the first term are discharged by settlement of Mr. Bolln with the city at the end of that term, and that they are also relieved from liability by reason of the failure of the city to make known any claim against the treasurer at the time of that settlement, when the bondsmen could have protected themselves out of Mr. Bolln's individual means; whereas, by making no claim at that time, the bondsmen had been lulled into a sense of security for a year and a half afterwards, during which time Mr. Bolln's property had been dissipated, and we were thereby prejudiced to the extent to which we have lost an opportunity to reimburse ourselves.  We believe that the second set of bondsmen never became liable to the city, because they signed the undertaking upon condition that it should not become operative until legally approved, and it never was legally approved, because there could be no legal approval until all funds received during his first term were produced and accounted for.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WOULD AVOID LITIGATION.</head>
                            <p>Our clients are, however, anxious to avoid litigation, and are willing for the purpose of securing a just and equitable settlement to waive what they regard as valid, technical defenses.</p>
                            <p>We, therefore, on their behalf, make you a proposition, in which, for the purposes of this proposition only, and for no other purpose, and with a view to securing a settlement and not intending to concede any of the facts claimed on behalf of the city, we will assume that the figures given by your experts as to the amount of shortage of Mr. Bolln are correct.</p>
                            <p>These figures disclose that on July 10, 189, according to the computation of your experts, there was a total shortage in funds of both city and school board amounting to $115,188.66.  This apparent shortage, however, we understand is now conceded on behalf of the city to be reduced by the sum of $10,000, a deposit in the Midland State bank, which is shown to have unquestionably belonged to the school board, and in lieu of which the school board has recently settled for the sum of $7,000, thus making the shortage to both school board and city, after treating the deposit in the Midland State bank as school money, $105,188.66.  This amount will be further somewhat reduced by payments that have been made upon cash tickets and advances.  According to the same figures, the amount owing the school board by the city treasurer on July 10, 1895, was $40,979.23, and there was then in bank to the credit of the school board, including the $10,000 in the Midland State bank, the sum of $16,208.95, so that of the entire shortage, as shown by the figures of your experts, existing on July 10, 1895, $24,770.28 was in the school fund and $80,418.28 was the shortage in city funds.  It would seem, therefore, that the loss which would fall upon our clients in the event that the city should be successful in suits against them, would aggregate the sum of $80,418.38, provided we should fail to make out our defense either in whole or in part.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">TALK OF AN OFFSET.</head>
                            <p>But, to offset the foregoing amount, <choice><sic>inpedent</sic><corr>independent</corr></choice> of the defenses which we have on the bonds to the city, we would have a right to be subrogated to the rights of the city to follow certain city funds which have been turned over improperly to the school board, and thus, in a large measure, to reimburse ourselves.  We have had an investigation made of the books, both of the city treasurer and the treasury of the Board of Education, and are thereby able to show result of various manipulations of city and school funds.</p>
                            <p>The law requires the city treasurer to keep separate funds of the city and those belonging to the Board of Education.  It also requires him to deposit in certain banks, selected by the city, funds belonging to the city.  In compliance with these requirements of the law, the record discloses that of the $226,728.94 school funds turned over the Mr. Bolln by his predecessor, he made deposits in a number of banks that he made custodians of school funds, $222,004.23, leaving only $4,124.71 mixed
                            
                            <pb n="252" xml:id="TMISB01-252"/>
                            
                            with the city funds.  Money collected for liquor licenses was never allowed to mix with city funds, and none of it was deposited in the city depositories.  The same is true of all receipts on account of state apportionments, except the sum of $13,129.93, being part of the state apportionment received on February 6, 1894.  The same is also true of all money received on behalf of the school board on account of the sale of bonds, except as to the sum of $1,390, which was realized on the sale of some Omaha bonds held for the benefit of the sinking fund of the school board, $205,808.22, taxes collected for the sinking fund of the school board, $221.02, miscellaneous receipts, such as police court fines, peddlers' licenses, etc., $122,139.65.  There was also drawn out from the board banks and placed in the drawer of the treasurer's office, mixed with city funds, for the payment of both board and city obligations, the sum of $129,000, thus making a total of $475,863.53 of school money which was mixed with the city money at the time it was received.  A large part of this money was separated from the city money at the treasurer's office, but part of it went into the city depositories, charged with a trust in favor of the Board of Education.  We are able to trace these separations as follows:</p>
                            <p>There was deposited directly from the treasurer's office into the board banks out of the funds above mentioned as mixed with the city funds the sum of $63,175.08, and there was used in the shape of cash, paid over the counter for school board warrants, the sum of $370,129.61, making $433,304.69 out of the $475,863.53 thus separated from the funds of the city, and leaving only $42,558.84 of board money that went into city banks impressed with a trust on behalf of the board.  There was also transferred from the board banks to city banks the sum of $61,202.75, making a total of transfers and deposits of school moneys that went into city banks, impressed with a trust in favor of the Board of Education of $103,761.59.  Against this amount, however, the treasurer drew checks upon the city banks for the payment of school board warrants to the amount of $70,076.23, thus leaving a net balance of board money in the city banks to the board banks the above sum of $33,685.36, the separation of board and city moneys would have been complete.  Instead, however, of transferring that amount to the board banks, he transferred from city banks to board banks the sum of $95,729.79, thereby taking out of the city banks and turning over into the Board of Education banks the sum of $95,729.79, thereby taking out of the city banks and turning over into the Board of Education banks the sum of $62,044.43 more than the amount necessary to apportion the funds between the two corporations.  This amount, therefore, of $62,044.43 went out of the city depositories  into the Board of Education depositories, impressed with a trust in favor of the city, and was never returned from the board depositories to the city.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">REDUCING THE SHORTAGE.</head>
                            <p>To the extent, therefore, of $62,044.43 is the city entitled to pursue the Board of Education and require a payment of that amount, and, if that is done, it will reduce the apparent shortage for which we understand the city now seeks to hold our clients, from $80,418.38 to $18,373.95.</p>
                            <p>We realize that there may be some reluctance on the part of the city to pursue these funds into the hands of the school board, on the theory that the board, having made a settlement with its bondsmen, may be liable to lose whatever amount is recovered from it and that a recovery on behalf of the city against the school board would be but the taking of funds from one public treasury and putting them into another, thereby resulting in no practical benefit to the taxpayers.  We fully appreciate the force of this reasoning, but will ask your honorable body to follow out the result a little further.  In the event that suits should be brought against our clients and that all the defenses which we may have, and on which we now believe we are entitled to rely, should fail us (although we do not believe they would), and if the city should thereby succeed in recovering judgment against our clients, aggregating $80,418.38, we would be subrogated to the rights of the city against the Board of Education, and could recover from that body the amount of $62,044.43, and thus the public, after long and expensive litigation, and the payment of unknown costs, would be gainer only by $18,373.95, while our clients, in the meantime, would be harassed with vexatious litigation and otherwise very seriously hampered and inconvenienced.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HERE'S THE PROPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>We, therefore, under the direction of our clients, and with a view solely of avoiding troublesome and vexatious litigation, and securing a just and equitable settlement, hereby propose that our clients shall pay to the city of Omaha the aforesaid sum of $18,373.95, and, upon so doing, shall be discharged from further liability.  We do not desire any undue haste in the disposition of this matter, but ask that it be given your attention at the earliest possible opportunity.  We are prepared to go into whatever examination of the accounts may be necessary with your finance committee and the city attorney, and believe that we can demonstrate to your entire satisfaction that the amount for which our clients may be ultimately liable to the public will not exceed the sum here offered.</p>
                            <p>One reason that impels us to ask as early a disposition of this matter as practicable is that our clients are being daily urged to make liberal subscriptions to the stock of the Transmississippi Exposition.  They are all men who would gladly do that, but feel seriously embarrassed by the large claims the city asserts against them, and, while they feel certain of being able in the long run of reimbursing themselves for most of the claim, they fully realize that before they are so reimbursed they may have a long road to travel, through years of litigation, and, with that prospect before them, they cannot make the subscriptions to the exposition stock which they would otherwise gladly do.</p>
                            <p>We append herewith a table showing the various distributions and separations of the funds above described in detail:</p>

                            <head type="sub">MEETING TO ELECT DIRECTORS CALLED</head>
                            <head type="sub">As Soon as This is Accomplished Active Preparations for Putting the Exposition in Shape Can Be Taken Up.</head>
                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition is assured beyond doubt, the $300,000 necessary to make the government appropriation available having been subscribed.  In accordance with the requirements of the articles of incorporation a meeting of stockholders has been called for the purpose of electing fifty directors and an assessment of 5 per cent on all stock has been levied.</p>
                            <p>The board of directors met at the rooms of the Commercial club last night for the purpose of canvassing the stock subscriptions and determining if the $300,000 mark had been reached.  After a long session, during which the situation was carefully canvassed, it was announced that the unconditional subscriptions amounted to $313,000, while there was an additional $40,000 which was hedged about by conditions which the board of directors said would be complied with within a few days.  In addition to these amounts it was stated that the Council Bluffs subscription had not yet been turned in and it was known to contain over $10,000.</p>
                            <p>The directors decided that efforts must not be relaxed, but that subscriptions should be solicited until at least $500,000 was subscribed.</p>
                            <p>The articles of incorporation provide that when $300,000 has been subscribed a meeting of the stockholders must be called for the purpose of electing fifty directors, who shall have full charge of the exposition, including the preliminary work.  In accordance with this requirement a meeting of the stockholders was called to be held in the large hall of the Board of Trade, on the second floor of the Board of Trade building, October 1 at 7 p. m.  This meeting will be adjourned from time to time and from day to day until the fifty directors have been elected.  As there are nearly 6,000 stockholders it will require some time for all to vote and the meeting will therefore be continued for the purpose of giving all a chance at the ballot box.</p>
                            <p>An assessment of 5 per cent on all stock was levied, the assessment being made due and payable before 6 p. m. of September 29, being forty-eight hours before the election of directors.</p>
                            <p>The secretary was instructed to mail to each subscriber to stock a notice setting forth the call for a meeting to elect directors and calling for an assessment of 5 per cent on stock subscriptions, including in the notice the statement that no subscriber would be allowed to vote at the election unless he paid his assessment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TO SECURE EXPOSITION FOR MILLER PARK</head>
                            <head type="sub">Have Already Secured Optional Lenses on Four Hundred Acres of Land Adjoining the Park on the South.</head>
                            <p>The North Side Improvement club has started to work in earnest to carry out its desire to location of the Transmississippi exposition at Miller park, and in furtherance of this object a meeting of subscribers to exposition stock was held in Erfling's hall last night.  There were over 200 subscribers present, and the liveliest interest was manifested in the business of the meeting.</p>
                            <p>R. W. Richardson called the meeting to order and stated that the meeting had been called for the purpose of bringing together those interested in seeing the exposition located on the site in the north part of the city.  He reviewed the work which had been done by the club to bring to the attention of the public the advantages offered by Miller park, referring in glowing terms to the many natural advantages possessed by the site in question, the accessibility to street railway and steam railway transportation, the natural drainage without necessitating expensive grading, sewer facilities, large water mains, and so on.</p>
                            <p>He called attention to the importance of securing the election of directors who would favor the selection of this site when it came to choosing a location for the exposition.  The first consideration, he said, would be to elect men who would be capable of carrying the exposition through successfully; the next consideration would be the choosing of men who would favor the location at Miller park.  In order to accomplish the desired object he said it would be necessary to consolidate the stock of all those interests in seeing the exposition located at the place proposed, and combining it with such other interests as would favor the same site, and thereby effecting the election of the proper men.  He suggested the appointment of a committee who should be empowered to gather up the proxies of those who favored Miller park, but would not be able to cast their votes for lack of time or any other reasons.  A number of subscribers, he said, had already paid their assessments and had mailed their proxies in blank to the secretary, having received the impression from the letter sent out by the secretary that that was the proper thing to do.  The speaker cautioned all subscribers against giving their proxies to any person unless they knew that person would vote the stock in accordance with the desires of the subscriber.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of Mr. Richardson's talk the following resolution was introduced by W. A. Saunders and unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That a committee be appointed by the president and secretary to procure the names of all stockholders and secure proxies of subscribers and also obtain all the support possible for candidates for directors favoring the location of the exposition at Miller park, the object being to concentrate the strength of all parties favoring Miller park so that it will be possible to elect a directory favorable thereto.</p>
                            <p>Following this the committee was empowered to have blank proxies printed and to take any steps deemed necessary to secure a list of the stockholders of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Another resolution was also passed requesting all stockholders favoring Miller park to either send their proxies, signed by themselves, but not filled in, to the committee appointed at the meeting, or else hold their proxies until the committee could call for the same.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed some time ago by the club to secure leases on lands adjoining Miller park reported that it had secured leases on 400 acres adjoining the park, extending on the east side of Thirtieth street as far south as Fort street.  This makes 480 acres with Miller park and is immediately adjoining the old Fort Omaha reservation.</p>
                            <p>A short recess was taken to allow the appointment of the committee provided for by the resolutions adopted.  The chairman then announced the following as the committee to collect proxies and carry out the spirit of the resolution creating the committee: W. A. Saunders, D. H. Christie, G. W. Holbrook, W. S. Wedge, John S. Carson, John Wigman and R. W. Richardson.</p>
                            <p>The meeting then adjourned for one week.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The long postponed conference between the representatives of the city and the bondsmen of ex-City Treasurer Bolln was held in the committee room of the city hall yesterday forenoon.  It was largely an exhaustive relation of facts and theories previously stated and resulted in little beyond emphasizing the impression that the Board of Education had very much complicated the situation when it settled its claim for $7,000.</p>
                            <p>The bondsmen were represented at the conference by W. A. Paxton, John F. Coad, Gustave Anderson, George E. Barker, L. D. Fowler and their attorney, T. J. Mahoney.  Councilmen Wheeler, Kennard and Benawa of the finance committee, City Attorney Connell and Louis Wettling were present to act for the city.  Kennard wanted to have a star chamber session, but his suggestion was denied by the bondsmen, who stated that they had nothing to conceal.  Mr. Mahoney explained the position of the bondsmen.  His statements were on the same line that was covered in his written proposition to the council, and his position rested on the allegation that after the $62,000, which he alleged had been illegally transferred from the city to the school fund, was subtracted, the bondsmen were only liable for something over $18,000.  He said that the only question to be considered was whether the city wished to sue the bondsmen for the full amount and then allow the bondsmen to reimburse themselves from the school fund, or to settle with the bondsmen for the amount for which they would be ultimately liable, and themselves collect from the Board of Education the amount which had been wrongfully transferred to the school fund.  He declared that there was no question from a legal standpoint but that the Board of Education was liable for the amounts that had been transferred from city funds.  In support of his position he quoted a Massachusetts case in which one man was trustee for two corporations.  He had transferred money from the treasury of one to that of the other, and the court had decided that the wronged corporation had undoubtedly the right to follow the money into the treasury where it had been received.  He argued that this was exactly a parallel case.  If the city now had a right to follow this $62,000 into the school fund and recover it, its rights would certainly subrogate to the bondsmen in case the whole amount in controversy should be recovered from the bondsmen.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COMPLICATES MATTERS.</head>
                            <p>Councilman Wheeler inquired why, if they believed that the shortage to the school fund was so great, the bondsmen had settled with the Board of Education.  He was assured that this was done by an altogether different set of bondsmen, and in fact, Mr. Mahoney continued, he could not criticise the bondsmen of the Board of Education for settling for $7,000 an apparent shortage of $34,000 when the members of the Board of Education themselves had been so anxious to effect the settlement.</p>
                            <p>City Attorney Connell stated that from a legal standpoint the city had a plain right of recovery against the bondsmen for the full amount claimed.  Whether the suit of the bondsmen against the Board of Education would lie in turn was not for him to consider.  In his opinion the only thing the committee could do was to sue the bondsmen for the full amount.  Then, if the bondsmen should recover from the Board of Education, it would place the responsibility where it belonged.  He added that there was no question but that the action of the Board of Education had seriously complicated the situation.  It had been done against his earnest protest, but when he tried to induce Attorney Covell for the board not to advise the settlement Covell had told him that he did not need any advice and proposed to run the business of the board to suit himself.</p>
                            <p>The bondsmen then tried to induce the representatives of the city to consent that all the issues of the case should be included in one suit, the result to determine what proportion of the defalcation should be made up by the Board of Education and how much by the bondsmen.  This was argued for some time, but was opposed by the city attorney and councilmen.  They contended that the city had nothing to do with the alleged accountability of the Board of Education, but that the only policy they could pursue was to bring suit against the bondsmen for the full amount and leave the bondsmen to obtain relief from the board if they could.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Barker brought up the proposition that if the city would accept the offer of settlement, the bondsmen would guarantee to raise a subscription of $50,000 for the exposition.  He would give $5,000 himself, but if he had a suit for $100,000 hanging over his head he would consider himself too poor to give a dollar.  It was also proposed that if this proposition should be accepted the bondsmen would assign their stock in the exposition to the city.</p>
                            <p>City Attorney Connell advised that it would be best to file the petition against the  bondsmen at once, but Chairman Kennard of the finance committee decided against it.  Consequently action was <choice><sic>posponed</sic><corr>postponed</corr></choice> until after the committee reports to the council.</p>

                            <head type="sub">United Effort to Secure the Exposition for Miller Park.</head>
                            <p>The North Side Transmississippi club was fully formed as a factor to work for the selection of Miller park as the exposition site at a meeting of north siders at Twenty-fourth and Cuming streets last night.  At a previous meeting the club had been partially organized by the election of S. B. Lake as president and J. H. Hussie as secretary.  The organization was last night completed by the adoption of a constitution and by electing the remaining two officers, J. H. Smith as vice president, and E. Jepsen as treasurer.  About fifty stockholders in the exposition company signed the roll.</p>
                            <p>J. H. Smith, Charles Peterson, Frank Johnson, J. H. Hussie and A. L. Patrick were appointed a committee of five to secure the proxies of residents of the city favorable to the Miller park site, to be used in the election of the board of directors.  This committee will work in conjunction with the similar committee of seven that was appointed by the North Side Improvement club to do a like work.  The committee was invited to use the headquarters in the Bee building which the North Side Improvement club committee has opened.</p>
                            <p>R. W. Richardson, president of the North Side Improvement club, stated that his club had secured leases for 500 acres of ground about Miller park and was doing everything it could to advance the interests of that site.  He invited the new club to join with his in the work that both desired to do.</p>
                            <p>W. A. Saunders was also present and related some of the work that had already been accomplished.  He advised that great care should be taken that competent directors should be elected in addition to being in favor of the Miller park site.</p>
                            <p>An invitation was accepted to meet with the North Side Improvement club on next Saturday night.  Adjournment was taken until next Friday night in the same hall.</p>

                            <p>A meeting of the South Side Improvement club was held last evening at Tenth and Hickory streets, and steps taken to corral the location of the Transmississippi Exposition.  A report was received from the committee on grounds which had a proposition from Thomas Murray.  It was accepted.  Mr. Murray will give the use of 148 acres of land adjacent to Riverview park, provided the taxes for the next two years are paid; that he is paid $1,500 in cash and certain grading is done on Valley street between Thirteenth and Tenth streets, at no cost to himself.  Speeches were made by Lee Estelle, A. E. Walkup, E. J. Cornish, Dr. Hanchett, Ernest Stuht and Isaac Hascall.</p>
                            <p>The following candidates for directors in the Exposition were named: Dr. Hanchett, E. J. Cornish and John Rush.  These gentlemen, acting with a committee consisting of Messrs. Cole, Darling, Estelle and McHugh, were appointed to place other candidates in the field and directed to make a slate with South Omaha and West Omaha interests to put through a large list of directors favorable to the south side.  It was stated that the street railway favors Miller park.  To offset this, gentlemen present proposed to get the influence of the railroads on their side.  A committee is going to raise the $1,500 to pay Mr. Murray by popular subscription in Omaha, the First ward and from the railroads, each being expected to pay one-third this sum.</p>

                            <p>The office of the secretary of the Transmississippi Exposition association is a busy place since the notices of the first assessment on the stock of the exposition were sent out.  The subscribers have responded promptly and many people, anxious to comply with the notices, are coming and going all the time.  The notices were mailed last Thursday and Friday and reached the subscribers Friday and Saturday.  The subscriptions commenced coming in Saturday and at noon today 419 had paid their assessments.  Many of these were sent by mail, but a large number of persons visited the secretary's office in person and made their payments.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield expressed himself as being gratified at the promptness with which the assessments were being paid and said a very creditable showing would be made if the present rate of payment continued until the date of the election of directors.</p>

                            <p>The Bee has ventured the opinion that all interests concerned in the exposition and represented on its stock subscription books should have representation of some kind in the exposition directory.  This applies to South Omaha, North Omaha, Council Bluffs and all parts of Omaha.  At the same time no one should be made a director who is not going to contribute actively to the success of the enterprise.  It would be better to have a vacancies on board than to have places filled by men who want to use the position for their own personal ends or whose connection with the management would do it more harm than good.</p>

                        <div2 type="article">
                            <p>The South Side Improvement club is determined that the northsiders shall not outdo it in the matter of offering inducements for the exposition site.  The <unclear reason="torn"/>orts of each faction center upon a public park adjoining which many acres of land have been conditionally secured.  South Omaha will doubtless pool with advocates of Riverview park, while powerful influences will be at work for the north end.  Partisans are trying to get as many directors as possible pledged in advance to one site or the other.  If one faction succeeds in this it follows that one site is to be selected without reference to the claims of another.  The directory would be like a packed jury.  Would it not be more rational to elect men to the directory who are big and broad-minded enough to consider the claims of every site and render an impartial decision?</p>

                            <p>Exposition stockholders are said the be paying the first assessment promptly, and it is confidently expected that nearly every share will be voted at the election of directors.  We doubt whether every stockholder appreciates the vital importance of this assessment.  It will not only make shareholders eligible to a vote in the election, but it will be an earnest of the validity of the subscriptions.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The election of a board of fifty directors for the Transmississippi and International Exposition association, which election has been called for October 1, is a matter which is exciting a great deal of interest among the citizens of Omaha who are stockholders in the association.  An interest has developed which is overshadowed only by the momentous issues of the impending national political campaign.  The various classes which have subscribed to stock each have their candidates and are electioneering in the interest of these candidates.  The advocates of particular sites are taking an active part in the canvass for votes, and the situation is rapidly becoming complicated by the multiplicity of interests.  Outside of the candidates presented and urged by the interests <choice><sic>refered</sic><corr>referred</corr></choice> to very few names have been mentioned for the directory, but there are indications that before the date of the election rolls around there will be a large number of names for the voters to choose from.</p>
                            <p>The members of the present board of directors, who were elected at the organization of the association and who have brought the project to a condition where its success seems assured, are candidates for re-elections as members of the new board, although none of them, so far as can be learned, are making any canvass for votes.  As it is now constituted the board of directors comprises the following:  G. W. Wattles, president; J. E. Markel, vice president; W. R. Bennett, J. H. Evans, Dudley Smith, Dan Farrell, jr., G. H. Payne, Charles Metz, I. W. Carpenter, H. A. Thompson and C. S. Montgomery.</p>

                            <p>The most aggressive campaign so far has been by the residents of the northern part of the city, who are inspired by a desire to see the exposition located in Miller park, a site near old Fort Omaha.  The North Side Improvement club has had the matter in hand and has been industriously organizing for the past few months.  A new club has been organized within the past few days for the purpose of working for the same object.  Representatives of these clubs say they have not selected any candidates to represent them in the directory, but have been concentrating all their efforts to secure votes in the interest of Miller park, and with these votes they purpose to secure the election of men who will agree to support Miller park when the question of location comes up for decision.  The northsiders say, however, that they do not intend to play "dog in the manger," but are open to conviction if a more available or better site is presented.  They have opened an office of the secretary of the exposition and are devoting all their energies to gaining converts.</p>
                            <p>The Southside Improvement club, which has been agitating the location of the exposition in Riverview park, has selected W. H. Hauchett, E. J. Cornish and John Rush as their candidates for directors, and the name of F. K. Darling has since been added, making four men whom the southsiders will endeavor to elect.  The southside residents do not make the question of location an absolute condition of their support, but say they are willing to let the question be settled in the theory of the greatest good to the greatest number.</p>
                            <p>The Retail Dealers' association has called a meeting for this evening to select candidates for directors.  The plan indicated by some of the members is to select two men to represent the retail dealers of the city and decided upon a plan of action to secure their election.  President Hospe is spoken of as being one of the men to be chosen and the secretary of the association, C. D. Thompson, is being talked of as the other man.  The object of the retailers' association, as indicated by some of the prominent members, is to secure the election of men of ability as directors, who will manage the exposition along business lines, allowing the question of location to be determined as the best interests of all concerned seem to indicate.</p>

                            <p>The Advertising Men's association is favorable to the election of C. D. Thompson as director, Mr. Thompson being a member of that association.</p>
                            <p>The Retail Grocers' association is another organization which has a candidate in the person of its president, C. R. Courtney.</p>
                            <p>The Letter Carriers' association has endorsed W. M. Victor as its candidate for director, and the members are busy in making deals to secure his election.</p>
                            <p>The Manufacturers' and Consumers' association has endorsed its secretary, O. C. Holmes, as a suitable man for director and the members of the association are working for his election.</p>
                            <p>The members of the city fire department have urged Chief Redell to become a candidate for director, and the chief has consented to stand for election to the position.</p>
                            <p>The local fire insurance men, with one exception, that one exception being by far the heaviest subscriber among the fraternity, held a meeting within the past few days and decided upon Chris Hartman as their representative, and they have been busy in canvassing for votes for his election.</p>
                            <p>The labor organizations of the city will hold a meeting Friday evening to decide upon a man to represent them in the directory, and will also decide upon a course of action to secure his election.  The labor organizations have solicited subscriptions among their members with a view of getting a representative on the board, but the leaders among them express some disappointment at the result of the canvass.</p>
                            <p>Besides <choice><sic>thes</sic><corr>these</corr></choice> movements of organizations to secure the election of representatives a few individuals have announced themselves as candidates for election and there are surface indications which point to the sprouting of several more ambitions before the day of election appears.  John A. Wakefield, the present secretary of the exposition association, has announced himself as a candidate for election as a director.  Mr. Wakefield is not a director in the board as at present situated and the amended articles of incorporation do not require that the secretary shall be a director, but it is claimed that there are many reasons why the secretary should be a member of the board of directors.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Ensor of South Omaha is another who has announced himself as a candidate for election as a representative of South Omaha, but some of the citizens of that flourishing suburb do not take kindly to the idea and are opposing the ambitions of the mayor.</p>
                            <p>W. B. Taylor has shied his castor into the ring and is a candidate for the position of director.</p>
                            <p>The payment of the 5 per cent assessment on stock subscriptions is being made with reasonable speed, over 700 subscribers having paid their assessments before noon today.  The amount paid in is about $2,100 and it has been found necessary to increase the office force in the secretary's office by the addition of a clerk to receive subscriptions and issue receipts.</p>

                            <p>PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 24.&#8212;John R. Gentry today, at Rigby Park, paced the fastest mile ever made in harness, and placed the world's record at 2:00½.</p>
                            <p>The day was cold and a light northwesterly wind was blowing up the stretch when John R. Gentry, with W. S. Andrews behind him, came out to go against his record of 2:01½ made on September 8, this year, at Glenn's Falls, N. Y., in the second heat of a race with Star Pointer.  Gentry had been given two warming up heats during the afternoon.  When he came out for the third the sun was rapidly sinking.  The famous paced scored once or twice with the runner, which was to pace him, and then went up the stretch in what was to be the fastest mile ever done by a horse in harness.  There was not a big crowd present, but what there was gave the pacer a great ovation as he came down the stretch for the word "go" and
                            
                            <pb n="258" xml:id="TMISB01-258"/>
                            
                            hundreds of watches caught the pacer at the start.  The runner was at the pacer's throat latch as they made the first turn on the stretch.  Gentry went steadily and with apparent ease, the runner having hard work keeping his position.  The judges caught the quarter mile at 0:19¼, and the second quarter was made in 0:30¼, making the half mile in 0:55½.  The runner, by the use of the whip, was keeping up at Gentry's wheel, but was making hard work of it.  The third quarter was made in 0:30¾, making the three-quarters in 1:30¼.  As they turned into the home stretch and caught the wind in the teeth the crowd began to yell wildly and both Andrews and the runner's driver commenced to ring encouragement to their horses and to use the whip a little.  With the shouting of the crowd, which was now cheering like mad, the pacers spurted for the wire and, considering that he had the wind in his teeth, made the most remarkable quarter of the heat, in 0:30¼, making the mile in 2:00½, just one second less than the former best record, first made by Robert J at Terre Haute in 1895, and equalled this year by John R. Gentry.</p>
                            <p>When Starter Culberson announced the time the crowd broke through the fence and crowded out on the track and around the pacer, cheering wildly.  It is believed that had Gentry not had to contend with the wind he would have made the mile in 2:00 easily.</p>
                            <p>During the afternoon Fantasy went against her record of 2:06, but only made 2:07¾.  After Gentry's great mile, Robert J came out to beat his record of 2:01½, but only succeeded in making the mile in 2:03½.  Tomorrow Star Point, John R. Gentry and Frank Agan will all go against time.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>At the regular meeting of the board of directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association, held at the Commercial club rooms at noon today, a large delegation of business appeared and presented a formal request to the directors to postpone the meeting of stockholders called for October 1 for the purpose of electing directors.</p>
                            <p>Among the prominent business and professional men present were General C. F. Manderson, J. H. Millard, Herman Kountze, Frank Murphy, A. L. Reed, A. T. Rector, Thomas Kilpatrick, C. E. Yost, E. Rosewater, C. F. Weller, John Brady, Milton Barlow, F. P. Kirkendall, W. A. Paxton, W. A. Redick and about twenty-five others.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson acted as spokesman for the delegation and asked that the stockholders' meeting and the election of directors be postponed until after the campaign and election.  He referred somewhat at length to the prevailing unrest, caused by the excitement incident to the campaign and to the business depression, due largely to the uncertainty prevailing in business circling on account of the financial agitation.  The speaker also urged a postponement on account of the conflict which had developed over the question of the location of the exposition.  He said it would be most unfortunate and would undoubtedly be fatal to the ultimate success of the exposition if men should be elected directors who were pledged or partial to any particular site.  General Manderson also referred to the fact that a large number of the largest corporations and many of the wealthiest citizens had refused to subscribe before the November election, and he appealed to the directors to postpone any further action in the direction of electing a board of fifty directors.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PAID ON THE SUBSCRIPTIONS.</head>
                            <p>As the conclusion of General Manderson's remarks Vice President Markel, who presided at the meeting in the absence of President Wattles, called upon Secretary Wakefield for a statement of the subscriptions which had been paid.</p>
                            <p>The secretary stated that 1,340 subscriptions had already been paid, being about 10,000 shares, or about one-third of the total amount subscribed.</p>
                            <p>It was asked if anything in the articles of incorporation would interfere with a postponement and C. S. Montgomery, the legal member of the board of directors, replied in the negative.</p>
                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick said he would bring the matter up for discussion by moving that the directors be requested to postpone the election of the new board of directors until November 20.</p>
                            <p>In the discussion which ensued C. S. Montgomery detailed the reasons which had actuated the directors in calling the meeting for the election of directors under the amended articles of incorporation, the main reason being that the time intervening before the holding of the exposition was all too short and it was thought best to have the election as <choice><sic>son</sic><corr>soon</corr></choice> as possible in order that the work might be got under <choice><sic>was</sic><corr>way</corr></choice> as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>W. R. Bennett opposed any postponement.  It had been reported, he said, that if Bryan was elected no exposition would be had.  He thought it would be dangerous to the success of the exposition to allow anything like politics to enter into the matter.  If there were good reasons other than political ones why the matter should be postponed he said he would support the movement.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AGREED UPON A DATE.</head>
                            <p>E. Rosewater was called for and said he deplored any postponement, but it appeared to be a necessity.  While it was advisable to exclude politics, he said it was almost impossible to do so when this campaign turned on the question of the money standard.  He thought, however, that it was unnecessary to postpone the election of directors so long and moved to amend the motion by fixing the date for November 10, and said the present board could do anything that might be necessary in the way of preliminary work.</p>
                            <p>The amendment carried, as did the motion, and the business men then withdrew, after which the directors took up the matter for consideration.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery introduced a resolution reciting the fact that "more than forty of the largest stock subscribers, representing about one-half of the aggregate subscriptions" had requested that the election of directors be postponed, <choice><sic>nd</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> providing that the said election be postponed, leaving the date blank.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith moved to make December 1 the date, for the reason that the railways and other large corporations insisted on having <choice><sic>representtion</sic><corr>representation</corr></choice> on the directory, and would not be able to <choice><sic>maye</sic><corr>make</corr></choice> any subscriptions until after election.</p>
                            <p>The amendment carried and the resolution was adopted as amended.</p>
                            <p>On motion of Mr. Montgomery, the time for the payment of the 5 per cent assessment on stock was postponed until 6 p. m. November 28.</p>
                            <p>The idea was advanced that a ticket of fifty business men should be nominated for directors, in order that men of unquestioned standing might be placed in the field.  After a general discussion this matter was made the order for the regular meeting next Friday.</p>

                            <p>There are a great many considerations that should bear upon the selection of the exposition site besides the particular end of town in which it is situated.  Questions of accessibility, adaption to architectural and landscape work, should all be carefully investigated and given due weight.  While there is no time to be lost in getting the preliminary work under way, there is some merit in the axiom about making haste slowly.</p>

                            <p>That the northsiders are using all the efforts in their power to have Miller park chosen as the exposition site was further evidenced today at the meeting of the North Side Improvement club last night.  Leases for 160 acres of ground in the immediate vicinity of the park were exhibited and it was reported that efforts were being made to secure still more land.  It is intended to offer the exposition company enough land for the big enterprise without compelling it to offer any bonuses.</p>
                            <p>The land which has been leased lies north and south of the park.  A portion of sixty acres extends from the south limits of the park to Fort street and Twenty-fourth to Thirtieth.  The balance lies to the north.  The leases are for three years and provide that only the taxes shall be paid, the company to retain possession <choice><sic>fo rthat</sic><corr>for that</corr></choice> length of time.  The owners are Lucretia R. Seymour, C. S. Shepard, the State National Bank of Cleveland and S. J. Firestone.</p>
                            <p>Fits <choice><sic>wer</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> exhibited to show the availability of the grounds as a site.  One colored plat contained the entire plot that will be obtained in addition to the park grounds in case the north side is favored with the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Speeches in favor of the site were made by R. W. Richardson, W. A. Saunders, J. H. Hussie, Emerson Benedict, G. Stortz and others.  While all the speakers desired the election of directors favorable to their site they urged that reputable and capable men should be voted for in every case.  Several believed that the question of a site should be overlooked entirely.</p>
                            <p>An adjournment was taken until next Monday night.</p>

                            <p>The North Side Improvement club held another big meeting in Erfling hall on Sherman avenue near Corby street last night, which was attended by some of the members of the North Side Transmississippi club, a newly organized body to advance the interests of Miller park as an exposition site.  During the course of the proceedings George F. Shepard reported that he had succeeded in obtaining leases upon grounds north and south of the park for three years without rental.  Speeches in favor of the site were made by R. W. Richardson, W. A. Saunders, J. H. Hussie, Emerson Benedict, G. Stortz and others.  While all the speakers desired the election of directors favorable to their site they urged that reputable and capable men should be voted for in every case.  Several believed that the question of a site should be overlooked entirely.  Another meeting will be held on next Monday night in the same place.</p>

                            <p>OMAHA, Sept. 24.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  Your editorial in regard to the unseemly haste of the men in certain sections of the city trying to locate the exposition regardless of the greatest good to the exposition was timely and to the point.  The scramble to get certain men on the board of directors because they are prejudiced in favor of a particular location is the most serious blow that has been given the project.  The board of directors should be composed of broad minded business men who are capable of handling a large proposition and who will not consider or countenance any corner lot or land scheme, but the place where experts, landscape engineers, etc., determine the place where the exposition can be made a success and the pride of Nebraska and the whole Transmississippi country.  Any man who has his mind made up to vote for a certain location regardless of the interests of the exposition is the very last man that should be elected to the position of a director.  Not many realize the magnitude of the work that is before us.  Yours truly,</p>

                            <p>The regular meeting of the directors of the Omaha Retail Grocers' association was held last evening.  The exposition question was discussed at length and it was decided to leave no stone unturned to secure the election of C. R. Courtney and George F. Munro to represent the grocers on the Board of Directors.</p>
                            <p>Telegrams from a Chicago soap manufacturer were read asking the association to take such action as would restore the output of that particular factory to the good graces of the grocers of the country.  As the Omaha grocers have had nothing to do with the boycott against the Chicago manufacturer that has been inaugurated in eastern cities no action was taken.  The question will probably come up before the next regular meeting.</p>

                            <p>Every South Omaha citizen who owns transmississippi exposition stock and who wishes to have the show located at least within a hundred miles of the Magic City should leave his proxy with Frank Moriarty, cashier of the Packers' National bank.  Frank will vote them for Riverview park, and the more he has of the proxies in advance the greater effect will it have in influencing outsiders to pay some consideration to our wishes.  The first meeting of the stockholders will be held October 1, and the fight for the location of the site will then begin in earnest.  The Riverviewers are strong in numbers and enthusiasm both in Omaha and South Omaha, and by getting together will all their individual and collective strength it is believed their project may be made successful.  Frank is working as hard as anybody to get the fair near South Omaha and has already exerted <choice><sic>considerble</sic><corr>considerable</corr></choice> favorable influence.</p>

                            <p>A very interesting little fight is getting on to its feet over the South Omaha membership of the exposition directoryship.  Hoctor has a number of friends who want to see him get it but it is thought he is in favor of someone else getting it.  Col. Hunt is no candidate, but there are several who believe he ought to have it.  Ed Johnston is no candidate either, but there are a lot of them who see no reason why he shouldn't have it.  John Doe does want it and is making quite a little canvas for it.  Ensor is the leading aspirant so far, however, and the chances are he will get it as the only direct opposition to him comes from those who amount to nothing in an influential way.</p>

                            <head type="sub">REASONS FOR CHANGING DATES.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exposition Directors Explain Why the Election Was Postponed.</head>
                            <p>OMAHA, Sept. 29.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: In justice to all the subscribers to the stock of the Transmississippi and International Exposition it is proper to explain the reasons which induced the board of directors to postpone the stockholders' meeting for the election of fifty directors until December 1, which action was taken at the last meeting of the present board, held on Friday, September 25.  At this meeting a large number of the subscribers, representing fully one-half of the total stock subscribed, were present and presented a resolution asking that the election of permanent directors and the assessment be postponed.  The subject was thoroughly canvassed, and after careful consideration the directors, conceding that the wishes of so large a part of the stockholders should be complied with, unless of serious disadvantage to the Exposition, by unanimous vote decided to postpone the meeting as requested.</p>
                            <p>The considerations which influenced the directors were as follows:</p>
                            <p>1. On account of the present stringent condition of financial affairs it was inconvenient for many of the business men, who had subscribed large amounts, to pay the assessments ordered on the short notice given, and unless paid, these men would not be allowed to participate in the election of directors.</p>
                            <p>2. Without having considered the matter the assessment was called September 14, to be paid prior to September 29, while the railroad employes and many other subscribers are not paid until the 1st to the 10th of the month, thereby making it inconvenient for them to pay by the date necessary to entitle them to a vote at the election.</p>
                            <p>3. The railroads, the packing houses and many business houses have declined to subscribe for stock until the business of the country is in a more settled condition.  They have signified their willingness to make liberal subscriptions as soon as better conditions prevail, and have in several instances expressed the desire to participate in the election of permanent directors.  Congress does not meet until December 1, and it was reasoned that if these subscriptions might be obtained and the amount raised to $500,000 before the certificate of the secretary of the treasury was made, we would be in better condition to ask for the proposed increase of $300,000 in the appropriation of the United States government.</p>
                            <p>4. It was urged that more subscriptions could be obtained by December 1, if the election of directors were postponed, than could possibly be obtained if the directors were elected on October 1, thereby depriving all future subscribers from having a vote for permanent directors.</p>
                            <p>It was therefore decided to postpone the election and continue vigorously the soliciting of subscriptions.</p>
                            <signed>JOHN A. WAKEFIELD, Secretary.</signed>
                        </div2>
                        <div2 type="article">
                            <p>Any attempt to make political capital out of the postponement of the election of exposition directors is silly and contemptible.  While the necessity of any delay is deplored, it is believed that postponement at present is in the interest of a greater exposition and more complete achievement hereafter.  The most cogent reason for it, and one which of itself should be sufficient, is the universal stringency in financial affairs and the consequent unwillingness of large corporations, property owners and business houses, which are nevertheless favorable to the exposition, to take up the matter actively during a month when every community is chiefly concerned with politics.</p>

                            <ab>ATLANTA, September 22.</ab>
                            <p>The 18th day of September, just passed, marked the first anniversary of the opening of the Atlanta Exposition.  The fact is a significant one, full of suggestion and import.  In the first place, to go back of things a little, the Exposition itself was, in a certain sense, a marvelous thing.  Not so much, perhaps, in the actual success of the undertaking, though that was great enough, nor the perfection, the completeness of the affair in point of design, execution and display.  That it was at all successful along these lines was a great thing, but the real greatness of the Exposition lay first in its conception and second in its results.</p>
                            <p>It was a marvelous sort of thing that such an enterprise should have been thought of at such a time by a Southern city.  To follow as it did so closely upon the heels of the greatest Fair the world has ever known, seemed in a certain sense an impertinent, as well as preposterous.  The fact of the matter is, the Atlanta Exposition was simply a great exhibition of a great faith&#8212;the faith of the Atlanta people in Atlanta.  That is the keynote to the Exposition's success, as it is the secret of the city's growth and prosperity.  Her people believe in her; they revere her past, admire her present and adore her future.  They believe in her as they believe in the whole South, and as representing in many respects the best of the South, which they love.  The spirit of Grady rests over the place, enthusing to noble enterprises, stimulating to brilliant successes.  It is this spirit that gave birth to the Exposition itself, and which has since been so sustained and strengthened in the results of the Exposition, directly upon Atlanta, and indirectly upon the whole South.</p>

                            <p>In many respects Atlanta's Exposition experience has been a unique one.  In the first place, all great enterprises are attended with risks that usually materialize into actualities; any unusual expansion or elevation is logically followed by its concomitant depression.  The history of all cities where great expositions have been held shows that while the direct result has eventually been for good, the period immediately following the holding of the fair has been one of marked depression.  The year just passed proves that this has not been true in Atlanta's case.  In point of fact, the two years just gone have been the most prosperous of her history, for of course the impetus to trade in the way of stimulating enterprises and attracting labor began to make itself felt long before the Exposition actually occurred, and it is safe to say that all and more that Atlanta gained by the anticipation of her fair she has been able to hold.  The increase in her population alone during the past two years is estimated to be in the neighborhood of 25,000.  This is enough to make a good-sized town of itself, and, added to the 80,000 shown by her last census before the Exposition, sends her reckoning to a pretty considerable figure.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps the most significant evidence of the city's increase and prosperity is given in the fact of her enlarged assessment roll.  So great has been this increase during the year that she has been enabled to reduce her taxes from one and a half to one-fourth per cent.  This reduction represents a very appreciable increase, and directly in line with it is the recommendation within the last few days by the Superintendent of the Water Works that water be made free to consumers.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The schools have but recently reopened, and a fair estimate may not be given, but reports already show such extraordinary increase over last year's numbers that the authorities are taking steps to furnish increased accommodations for the extra pupils.  The stimulus given to business has been in every respect a wholesome one.  There has been no undue inflation anywhere, and not a single failure of consequence has occurred within the year.  On the other hand, new enterprises have been numerous and increased trade invariable.  Two national and several private banks have been opened within the year, and new buildings representing nearly two million dollars have been erected.  A woolen mill costing about $200,000 and a $150,000 plant for planing and manufacturing interior furnishing have been built.  Two large cotton mills have both doubled their capacity within the year, and the saw factory, the only plant of the kind in the South, whose exhibit at the Exposition received the highest award over the oldest works in the country, has increased its trade fifty per cent.  These particularities are but evidence of the general advance and may be cited as representative enterprises.</p>
                            <p>And not in a business way only is this stimulation felt.  Enthusiasm and prosperity are contagious, and Atlanta has a severe attack of both, which are making themselves felt all alone the line.  There is perhaps no city of the size in the country, and certainly none in the South, where so much is done in a social way, and while this has always been so, the Exposition has in no small measure, by the series of lectures and conferences then presented, given an impetus to intellectual life and thought, suggesting new lines of study and research.  In this connection it is pleasant to note Atlanta's interest in the way of women's clubs, organizations whose direct object is the broadening and upbuilding of woman's sphere of usefulness by pure, sound wholesome study and thought.  Prominent among these may be mentioned the History Club, the oldest organization of the kind in the city, and of which Mrs. Buck is president; the Woman's Club, which has eight departments, each with a separate chairman, Mrs. W. B. Lowe, president; the Nineteenth Century Club, Mrs. Albert Cox, president; the Peabody Alumni Club, Miss Young president, and the Every Saturday Club, Mrs. Isaac S. Boyd president.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Just now these several organizations are no doubt all more or less interested in the great national movement, which is to <choice><sic>culcinate</sic><corr>culminate</corr></choice> in the Home Congress soon to convene in Boston, Mass.  Mrs. Ellen A. Richardson, the director of the Home Congress, was a visitor to Atlanta during the exposition, acting as a juror of awards in the exhibit of decorative arts, and it is her direct influence that is creating the interest here in the Home Congress, and its far-reaching, practical educative work.  Atlanta is a city of homes, beautiful, hospitable, cultured homes, and her home-keepers are interested in the congress by reason of the fact that during its six weeks' session&#8212;from October 5 to November 7&#8212;topics bearing upon the practical life and interests of the people in home responsibilities will be considered in the light of scientific knowledge, experience and observation, and doubtless some member of one of her clubs will represent her at the congress, but just who this will be has not yet been determined upon.</p>
                            <p>I have said that Atlanta is a city of beautiful homes; situated in the midst of a Georgia wood, her natural growth of forestry is wonderfully pleasing.  In fact, to use a homely expression, one can scarcely see the town for the trees, and even in the very heart of the city beautiful shaded lawns are the rule and not the exception.  Naturally, it is also a city of beautiful streets.  No place in the land can board a finer thoroughfare than beautiful Peachtree, which during the late afternoons or early Southern "evenings" presents a panoramic picture of Atlanta life, gay with handsome equipages and charming women.  At such times it would seem that all Atlanta was on wheels, and that is just what she is; on wheels that revolve with enterprise and purpose in every spoke, and which will carry her on to that future which her faith has prepared.</p>

                            <dateline>THE OMAHA DAILY BEE: <lb/> SUNDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1896.</dateline>
                            <head type="sub">Location of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>OMAHA, Oct. 10.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  Every day makes it more apparent that to secure a solid, broad-minded, business men's directory for the exposition it is absolutely imperative that the question of location shall be divorced from the selection of directors.  This becomes an impossibility when it is known that one of the first duties of the new directors is to choose a site.</p>
                            <p>There is a strong fight being made in favor of three different sites and a large number of stockholders will vote for no candidate for the directory not known to be pledged to the voter's choice.  Business qualifications, if considered at all, are but secondary.  Such being the state of affairs, a yellow dog would stand a better show to get on the board than a capable man not in sympathy with a majority of stockholders on the location.</p>
                            <p>This matter is easy of solution.  It is the inevitable consequence of the charter directors failing to provide for the stockholders to settle this question by their ballot, nothing being easier than to vote on the site when voting for directors.  There is also a stronger reason for the justice of this plan in the right of all investors in an enterprise to have a say where their money shall be risked, for the reason that some locations would mean failure, while a more accessible site might insure success.</p>
                            <p>Now, I wish to attribute honest motives to all that has been done so far, but any observer can not but look with suspicion on any refusal by the board of directors of the right of the stockholders to locate this site.  While the board may have thought that the public was not competent to deal with this question I venture to say that every share subscribed will vote for the location most likely to return a dividend and there will be less opportunity for a ring to work for the benefit of a few interested ones who get on the inside.</p>
                            <p>The suspicion is frequently and openly avowed that the present board has made up a slate and will control the complexion of the new board by fair means or otherwise and this suspicion will grow until the board takes action as well silence it.  The threat is made by many stockholders that if they are tricked in this matter their first assessment of 5 per cent will be the last which they will pay.</p>
                            <p>The American citizen wants fair play, an honest expression of the majority, and then he always gracefully abides by the decision.  Any questionable move at this time would raise such a storm that the whole enterprise will be endangered by the very ones who, if treated by fair means, notwithstanding their disappointment, would stand nobly by any enterprise for the good of our city.</p>
                            <p>Let us locate this exposition where a majority of the shares desire, and let there be no possible question about the honest collection and count of the ballot, then there will be no "kick coming" and nothing will stand in the way of electing a board of capable managers for a directory.</p>

                            <l><hi rend="emphasis">President Omaha Real Estate Exchange.</hi></l>
                            <p>Since John G. Saxe wrote these verses in the early part of the seventies, Omaha has passed through all the phases of civilization that many Eastern cities have passed through in one hundred and fifty years, and that many European cities have passed through in a thousand years.</p>
                            <p>The verses did justice to the town when written; to-day Omaha has as good schools, as good churches, as good stores, as good factories, as good theatres, as good office buildings, as good streets, and as good methods of street transportation as any city of 140,000 people anywhere.</p>
                            <p>Its percentage of illiteracy is less than that of Boston, the city of culture.</p>
                            <p>Its percentage of church membership is greater than that of Brooklyn, the city of churches.</p>
                            <p>If there be truth in the old adage "The good die young," not much can be said for the city's piety, for its death rate is less than that of any other city in the United States.</p>
                            <p>All railways do not lead to Omaha, but with two exceptions all the great railways in the central Mississippi Valley do, and one of these, the Illinois Central, is only waiting for normal business conditions to prevail again to come in.  There are, however, extensions and connections to be made and gaps to be filled in, which, when completed, will open up to Omaha a vast field for trade from which it is now excluded.</p>
                            <p>There are four direct lines to Chicago, any one of which will carry you through in a night; three to St. Louis; three to Kansas City; two to St. Paul and Minneapolis; three to Denver.  You can eat a 6 o'clock dinner in Omaha and the Union Pacific will deliver you in Denver, 572 miles away, for a 7 oclock breakfast.</p>
                            <p>This, as well as its other fast trains, is pulled by locomotives built in the Omaha shops, at least five of which locomotives are heavier by from 22,000 to 67,000 pounds than the now famous New York Central locomotive, 999, exhibited at the World's Fair.  Besides these there are lines radiating in nearly every direction from Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Situated as Omaha is at the gateway between the East and the great cattle ranges of the West, and in the center of a wonderful corn belt, it is not strange that it should be the third beef and pork packing center of the world.  Its geographical position makes these great packing houses a natural sequence.</p>
                            <p>But it is not so plain why, situated as it is five hundred miles from the nearest gold or silver mines, and remote from the source of fuel used in smelting, it should have the largest smelting works in the world; but such is the case, and every mining State and territory, and even Mexico, British Columbia and Alaska, contribute to its support.</p>
                            <p>Profiting by the experience of larger cities that waited too long to adopt a park system, Omaha has laid out a park system commensurate with a large city which it is destined to be.  Besides two inside parks, it has four large outside parks, the adjournment of which is hardly more than begun, and all are to be connected by broad avenues and boulevards.</p>
                            <p>In connection with these a boulevard to Fort Crook is now being constructed.  Fort Crook occupies a beautiful site of 640 acres just south of the city.  In extent of ground and buildings it is the largest military post in the United States and will, to a certain extent, always be considered a part of the park system.</p>
                            <p>Omaha has been built up not by any forced pressure but by the demand of the trade which centered there.  Her wholesale merchants practically monopolize the trade of Nebraska and Wyoming, a part of Western Iowa, a part of South Dakota and Northern Kansas, and compete for trade in all the Western territory clear to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                            <p>The eastern half of the State is a phenomenal crop country.  The western portion is sparsely settled and subject to failure of certain kinds of crops.  These failures have been heralded as crop failures in Nebraska, while as a matter of fact they cut but a small figure in the annual product.</p>
                            <p>Crop failures in Western Nebraska are a thing of the past.  Their misfortune has proved to be their fortune.  Their failure has led to what will be their abundant success.  Since the failure of 1893 (the only total failure known) irrigating ditches have been built and are yet being built with such rapidity that it is not practicable to get accurate statistics on the subject.</p>
                            <p>The State Board of Irrigation reports 1,121 miles of complete ditches and 811 miles under construction.  The number of acres under these canals (number of acres that can be irrigated from them), is given at 863,000.  Some idea of the extent of these ditches can be grasped when you consider that they would make one continuous canal that would reach from Omaha to New York and from thence to Montreal.  The area that may be irrigated by these ditches is about equal to the entire State of Delaware.</p>
                            <p>It is generally estimated that one acre
                            
                            <pb n="283" xml:id="TMISB01-283"/>
                            
                            under irrigation has a productive power equal to at least three acres in the most favored localities and under most favorable circumstances where artificial watering is not resorted to.  Of course, it has not been possible in the short time of three years to get a large proportion of the lands available into actual cultivation; in fact, but a small proportion is actually under irrigation, 
                            <figure n="drawing">

                            but the crops raised "under the ditch" in 1894 gave an impetus to ditch building.  The unprecedented yield of 1895 and 1896 of lands thus watered makes it only a question of time when every available stream will be tapped and every available acre put under irrigation.  The element of risk is entirely eliminated in farming by irrigation.</p>
                            <p>The importance of these canals to the State and to Omaha, its metropolis, can hardly be estimated, and few people even in the Eastern part of the State have any conception of what is going on in this direction in the Western half.</p>
                            <p>Sugar beet raising has become an important industry in Nebraska in the last few years.  The Oxnards have two large factories in the State, and it has been demonstrated that beets raised by irrigation are equal in quality to those heretofore used, and the yield is from three to five times as great.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the sugar beet industry, Secretary of Agriculture Rusk said Nebraska was the sweetest State in the Union.  It is "sweeter" now than when he said it, and is destined to be much sweeter still.</p>
                            <p>An idea of Nebraska's growth may be obtained from the following crop reports:</p>

                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi Congress, a body composed of delegates from every State and Territory west of the Mississippi River, has long cherished the idea of holding an exposition at which would be exhibited the agricultural, horticultural, mineral and manufactured products of the entire Trans-Mississippi country, and to tell as far as possible by reproductions and representations the history of the West from its earliest settlement by the early Spanish missionaries, nearly a hundred years before the landing of the pilgrims, down to the present time&#8212;a story of adventure, of hardship, of enterprise, of success that has few if any parallels in the annals of the race.</p>
                            <p>The project grew, and at the annual meeting of the Congress in 1896 it was determined to hold the exposition in 1898, and to make it international in scope, and by a unanimous vote Omaha, on account of its commanding position in the Trans-Mississippi country, was selected as the site of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government appropriated $250,000 for a building and exhibit.  Some of the Trans-Mississippi States have, and all are expected to, make liberal appropriations, and the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition will come off in Omaha from May to November, 1898.</p>
                            <p>If our Eastern friends will only turn their faces to Omaha instead of Europe in 1898 they will see a good many things; they will learn a good many things; they will learn to unlearn a good many things.  They will see from the Mississippi River to Omaha an agricultural country with no superiors and few if any equals east of that river.  They will see the biggest show ever given, barring the World's Fair at Chicago.  They will learn that two-thirds of the area of the United States is west of the Mississippi River, and that it is there that the surplus population of the East must find homes.</p>
                            <p>They will learn that there is no provincialism in the West, that its population is cosmopolitan.  If they have learned from editorial writers in the East, who have never seen the West, that there is a prejudice in the West against the East, this is one of the things they will learn to unlearn.  They

                            will learn that the West does not overestimate its importance or underestimate the importance of the East.</p>
                            <p>The West knows what it wants and is not afraid to ask for it.  It wants money to develop its dormant resources.  It wants factories to supply the growing demands of its people.  It wants honest, industrious, patriotic citizens from the East, who love the home of their birth and will love the home of their adoption.</p>

                            <head type="sub">An Enterprising and Progressive City in Missouri.</head>
                            <p>Springfield, Mo., October 2.&#8212;This busy and beautiful little city has not yet been represented in your enterprising paper.  It is high time its advantages and attractions were made known to the migrating public, and no better means could be desired than through the columns of the National Real Estate Guide.</p>
                            <p>In the first place it has an unrivaled climate.  One was more forcibly convinced of this from the reports of the heat victims during the past summer much farther north then this.  Its altitude, situated as it is on the plateaus of the Ozark range, gives a clear and invigorating atmosphere.  The summers are long, but bright and breezy, with cool, restful nights.  The winters are short, dry and open.</p>
                            <p>The face of the country is singularly attractive, being a happy union of prairie and woodland.  The soil is rich and well adapted to agricultural and horticultural purposes, particularly in small fruit growing, the shipping facilities for which are good&#8212;railroads going out in every di-</p>
                            <p>It has large tributary territory, being the distributing point for all Southwestern Missouri and Northern Arkansas, and in consequence its wholesale houses and manufactories do a thriving business.</p>
                            <p>While Springfield is the center of an extensive farming, fruit growing and stock raising region, it is not wholly dependent upon it.  Lead and zinc mines are being operated at different points, and, still in comparative infancy of development, are of the richest grade of ore and deposit.  Building stone of different kinds, fire and potters' clay, and splendid forests of oak, ash, walnut, maple and cedar add their abundance to the untold wealth of this section.</p>
                            <p>The city itself is quite metropolitan.  There are many miles of electric railways, and many more partially completed, but temporarily abandoned for lack of means.  This is a splendid opportunity for the investor, for the property is to be had at a bargain.  The water supply is abundant and pure, being brought from springs some miles from the city.  Educational advantages are of the very best, and the public schools equal any in the land.  The normal school buildings are fine, and the facilities offered are unsurpassed by any other school.  Drury College, by the number of its rich endowments, is especially equipped, and its curriculum as advanced as the older Eastern colleges.  Living is comparatively cheap here, and to the investor or homeseeker there is no place that offers so many advantages and so few drawbacks.</p>
                            <p>Many things afford opportunities not to be overlooked by those who have money to invest.  Another good hotel is much needed, the uncompleted railways are worth considering.  Small fruit growing is very profitable and poultry raising has become quite an industry.</p>
                            <p>The discovery of lead and zinc is recent, but sufficient has been done to show that there are large bodies of ore here only waiting for capital.  There are two camps in operation and paying good dividends.  One is owned by an English company and the other by a home company.  Another English and Scotch company has begun operations in an adjoining country with fine prospects.</p>

                            <p>In speaking of the condition of the real estate market the Times says: "The present is a good time for those who have cash on hand, which they can spare, to obtain bargains in real estate.  It is during such times as the present that shrewd investors make money.  While some nervous persons are hesitating as to the immediate future, the man of cool nerve and good judgment steps in and secures property which may net him a profit of 50 per cent, within six months."</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">A WORD WITH OMAHA.</hi></head>
                            <p>Under this head the Denver News recently served notice upon Omaha that the re-election of David H. Mercer and the rejection of William Jennings Bryan by the voters of this city will be resented by the people of Colorado and the silver states as a declaration of war upon their interests, and that from that hour on Omaha must forego their support for the Transmississippi exposition.</p>
                            <p>This threat can be viewed in only one light.  It is an insolent attempt to coerce the voters of Omaha into retiring from public service the man who has served them in congress with signal ability and fidelity, and upon whom they must rely for getting the exposition appropriation through the house of representatives.  Without disparaging Judge Duffie's ability as a lawyer and crediting him with the best of intentions, we venture to assert that it would take him ten years in congress to do what Mercer has done in the last session.  Mr. Bryan himself represented this district two years without getting a dollar voted for any public improvement, and the only appropriation he was able to secure in his second term, with a democratic speaker and a democratic house, was for an elevator in the Lincoln postoffice.</p>
                            <p>It is equally insolent for any one in Colorado to try to swing a club over the heads of the voters of this city by telling them that unless they vote for Bryan and free silver Colorado will refuse to exhibit its minerals and products in the proposed Transmississippi Exposition.  The Bee has shown no disposition to drag this great enterprise into local politics, but in view of the fact that the supporters of Bryan and Duffie are seeking to make capital out of the Colorado manifesto, we are impelled to speak without reserve on the subject to the citizens of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>It may as well be understood first as last that there will be no exposition held in the city of Omaha in the year 1898 if Bryan is elected president.  That much must be apparent to every rational person, whether he be democrat, populist or republican.  With less than nineteenth months from the day of election to the date set for opening the exposition, it will tax the energies of the managers to the utmost to prepare the plans, select the grounds, erect the necessary buildings and make provision for displaying the exhibits.  It is conceded even by Bryan himself that his election would be followed by a temporary convulsion incidental to the revolution in our monetary system.  It would take months and maybe years before business could adjust itself to the new conditions.  And nobody could foretell what changes would take place in the construction of buildings and the price of machinery and other appliances requisite to an exposition of first magnitude.  Nobody could, with any degree of safety, venture into an undertaking without knowing what sums will have to be raised and with no probability of being able to increase the stock subscriptions beyond those already secured.  Whatever visionaries and enthusiasts may say, nobody who has the slightest conception of the business disturbance that must precede a change of money standard can fail to understand that for the time being, at least, the Transmississippi exposition would have to be abandoned.</p>
                            <p>Leaving out of consideration whatever political preferences men may have, these facts stand out in bold relief:  The Transmississippi exposition cannot be held in the year 1898 unless assurance is given by the election of McKinley that no change will be made in our monetary standard.  Assume that the threat made in the name of Colorado will be carried out, the choice resolves itself into this&#8212;between an exposition without a Colorado exhibit and no exposition whatever.</p>
                            <p>For our part, we do not believe the Colorado paper has any right to speak for Colorado.  The people of Colorado are intelligent and enterprising.  They have never yet failed to advertise their resources when they have had a chance to do so and they will not stand in their own light in 1898 even if disappointed in the election of president, which they are sure to be.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TO PLAY HER PART IN A TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <head type="sub">TO BE HELD AT OMAHA</head>
                            <head type="sub">Two Years From Date &#8212; Secretary Pinney, of the Commercial Club, Is Taking Up the Proposition&#8212;What Is Proposed by the Promoters.</head>
                            <p>The Commercial club is gathering statistics about the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha from June to November, 1893, with a view to giving Minnesota people reliable information pertaining to the manner and extent to which the several Western and Southern states will participate in the big event.</p>
                            <p>Minnesota's record at the world's fair was excelled by few, if any, states, and our people have an opportunity to enroll the state's fame far in the lead at Omaha, if the enterprise is thoroughly understood and then vigorously handled by the state, county and city officials, especially in the preliminary details.</p>
                            <p>From a letter just received by the Commercial club, in response to inquiries made by Secretary Pinney, the following interesting facts about the exposition are selected, from which it will be seen that Minnesota must begin to discuss what this state will do at Omaha, and follow at once with careful and intelligent action if we are to "keep company" with the neighboring states of the Mississippi valley:</p>
                            <p>"The committee having the exposition in charge is an incorporated body.</p>
                            <p>"A stockholders' meeting will be held Tuesday, Dec. 1 prox., for the purpose of electing a board of fifty directors.  Three <add>hundred</add> and forty thousand dollars of the capital stock of the corporation has now been subscribed for, which does not include the brewers, packing houses, smelting works, railroads and some other large interests.  From these sources additional subscriptions are expected sufficient to bring the total amount up to $600,000.  All of this amount has been raised here in Omaha.  Then it is the purpose to go out into the State of Nebraska and into the other Trans-Mississippi states and endeavor to secure subscriptions sufficient to bring the total up to the authorized capital stock of the corporation, viz., $1,000,000.  (If this can be done, then it is practically assured that we will not have to assess the stock subscribers more than 50 per cent of the amount of their subscriptions, as $500,000 is all that the corporation shall want for its corporate uses.)  The County of Douglas, in which Omaha is situated, is expected to vote $200,000 to the exposition.  The State of Nebraska will probably vote $300,000 additional.  The Trans-Mississippi states and territories will undoubtedly appropriate a total of $500,000 or more for the representation of their various states.</p>
                            <p>"Congress has passed a bill appropriating $200,000 for the government building and exhibit, and at the coming session of congress the assurance is given that an additional $300,000 will be appropriated, making a total United States appropriation of $500,000.  This showing contemplates the expenditure of $2,000,000 on the exposition, which does not include the large amounts to be expended by holders of concessions, privileges, etc.</p>
                            <p>"It is the unanimous belief that an exposition of this character will be of incalculable and far-reaching benefit to the entire Trans-Mississippi country, and it is the desire that the interest and participation of the various states in this exposition will be of the fullest and most complete character, that the best resulting benefits may obtain.</p>
                            <p>"Louisiana will make a noble presentation of its products, resources and capabilities, as its state board of agriculture has been given carte blanche by the legislature of the state in this matter, pledging the state to pay the expenses.</p>
                            <p>"Iowa and Utah have promised the fullest representation.  California has already taken steps for the introduction of a bill in its legislature this winter providing for an appropriation of $75,000 for the representation of California's interests at the great show.  From all of the other states come words of cheer and commendation for the enterprise, and promises that when their legislatures meet this winter, the strongest efforts will be made to present the matter in the broadest and best manner, so that generous appropriations may be made for the fitting and ample representation of these states.</p>
                            <p>"All these things lead to the belief that the time is ripe for an exposition of this character, and that Omaha should have here in 1898 the greatest exposition this country has ever seen, excepting only the World's Columbian exposition, held in Chicago in 1893.</p>
                            <p>"It goes without saying, of course, that the great State of Minnesota is sure to be largely and fittingly represented at this exposition.  Minnesota is not the sort of state that hangs back, nor the state to allow of the holding of an exposition of this character at this near-by point without providing that Minnesota's great resources, varied products and immense capabilities are fittingly and properly represented thereat."</p>

                            <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 11.&#8212;The result of the national election, which insured a safe governmental financial policy, has restored confidence in this section and brought evidence of renewed business activity.  The Tennessee Centennial exposition is now an assured success, and no such enterprise ever had better and more encouraging prospects.  The work of erecting buildings and beautifying the grounds has gone on, despite the excitement of the political campaign and visitors from other states are amazed at the extent and scope of the enterprise and splendid proportions of the great buildings.  The enterprise has steered clear of debt and will be pushed forward with redoubled energy and increased expenditure to make it the most beautiful and complete exposition ever held in the south.  There is a constant demand for space for exhibits coming from every state in the union and from foreign countries.  The exposition will open May 1, 1897, and it is the determination of the management to avoid the mistakes of other expositions, and have everything complete on the opening day so that the very first visitors will enjoy a full exposition, without the annoyances of unfinished work.  Evidences are multiplying that this great agricultural, commercial and industrial celebration of Tennessee's centennial will be one of the most successful occasions in the new era of prosperity and business activity which is promised by the renewal of confidence and the manifest spirit of progress which is now abroad in the land.  An appropriation for a government exhibit, which was passed by one house at the last session of congress, is expected to be provided at the coming term, and that and the state appropriation and greatly increased subscriptions in Tennessee, will add to the already assured success of a state celebration under exceptionally auspicious circumstances.</p>

                            <p>It is to be hoped that the directors of the exposition association will lose no further time in serving notice on the secretary of the treasury that the conditions embodied in the act of congress granting official recognition for and pledging the co-operation of the United States government in the Transmississippi and International exposition have been complied with.  There is always a great deal of red tape in the Washington departments, and it may be weeks if not months before the treasury officials complete their inquiry and certify to the president that the requisite subscriptions to the exposition stock have been made.  It is also to be taken for granted that some time may elapse after Secretary Carlisle's report has been handed to the president before the proclamation announcing to the people of this country and all the world that a great exposition will be held in Omaha in 1898 shall issue from the white house.  This proclamation cannot be issued too soon.  It will take months for American ministers and consuls abroad to bring the exposition to the notice of foreign governments and exhibitors who may desire to participate.  It is, moreover, desirable, if not absolutely vital to the success of the exposition, that the president's proclamation shall issue before congress reconvenes, or, at any rate, before the various state legislatures of the Transmississippi states shall begin their sessions.  It must be borne in mind also that up to this time there has been no official action take by the United States government that can be construed as definitely assuring the Transmississippi exposition beyond pledging an appropriation of $200,000 for a government building and exhibit.  This pledge is of no value unless congress at its coming session shall make it good by a specific appropriation.  In order to make sure of this appropriation congress must be furnished tangible proof of our financial ability to carry the project to successful completion.  We must bring to its knowledge the sufficiency of the stock subscriptions and donations to the exposition association to constitute a guaranty of good faith.  Inasmuch as the coming session of congress must terminate on the 4th day of March next, there is no time to be lost in securing the requisite treasury certificate and proclamation of the president.</p>

                            <p>Senator Allen's position on the exposition is sufficiently reassuring to put an end to all rumors and reports that the populists propose to antagonize or obstruct the exposition.  On the contrary the senator, as well as the state officers, will, we feel sure, do all that lies in their power to make the enterprise a success.&#8212;Omaha Bee.</p>
                            <p>Don't worry over the populists.  They are not opponents of the exposition.  But if the Transmississippi Exposition officials are in search of an "influence" that promises little advantage to the exposition they will turn their attention to The Omaha Bee.  The persistent and malignant attacks of The Bee upon western states and western men would be a positive injury if The Bee's claim to influence was not a thing of the past.&#8212;World-Herald.</p>
                            <p>The Bee claims to have no influence over anybody, whether populist, democrat or republican.  It can, however, truthfully claim to have done more for the upbuilding of Omaha, of Nebraska and of the whole west than any man or all the men put together whom it has antagonized politically.  It would be a great community upon the people of the mining states if they were to boycott an exposition of their own resources because The Omaha Bee in a campaign which involved not only the credit and honor of the nation, but imperilled its entire financial fabric, has stood up for McKinley, sound money and the policies of protection and reciprocity that had given prosperity to this country in former years.  If The Bee has struck hard blows for what it believed to be right and just and against what it knew to be deceptive, delusive and destructive, why should that in any way work to the prejudice of an enterprise that has for its aim the development of the resources of the Transmississippi country?</p>
                            <p>But The Bee would not retract or unsay one word it has uttered in support of McKinley and the principles for which he stands if it knew absolutely that the exposition would have to be abandoned.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately the men who shape the destinies of the states west of the Rockies are built on the broad-gauge pattern.  They possess in the highest degree the qualities requisite for building up an empire.  They know enough to know that no enterprise has ever been projected that would present as great an object lesson to capitalists and thrifty people contemplating a change of base as will the Transmississippi Exposition.  They also know that no medium in this region will be more potential in promoting the success of this enterprise than The Omaha Bee in spite of the alleged loss of influence.</p>

                            <dateline>DESERET EVENING NEWS:  SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1896.</dateline>
                            <head type="main">NOW, FOR BUSINESS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Transmississippi Congress Which is to Meet in Salt Lake.</head>
                            <head type="sub">BIG EVENT LIKELY TO BE SOON.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Hon. W. J. Bryan is President and Will Be Present&#8212;Bright Suggestions to Think About.</head>
                            <p>Now that the election is over and that the excitement attendant upon it has subsided thinking men are turning their attention to business&#8212;to the more certain and substantial affairs of life.  This is true in Salt Lake City as well as elsewhere.  It should be so to a greater extent that it is.  The prospects are that a revivification movement will shortly be started.</p>
                            <p>The opportunity will be furnished by the Transmississippi Congress which was to have been held in Salt Lake prior to the election, but which was postponed until after the great battle; also by the Semi-Centennial celebration of this State which is to be held here during this summer of 1897.  Additional interest will be aroused over the former in the announcement that Hon. William J. Bryan, its president, will be here to preside over the great body's deliberations.  Concerning the celebration referred to it can be said that the committee which was recently appointed by Governor Wells will shortly get down to earnest active work.  Good results are sure to follow.  Mr. C. E. Wantiand who has taken a great deal of interest in both movements, when queried by a NEWS man today said:</p>
                            <p>If the people of Salt Lake will wake up and shake themselves a splendid opportunity can be grasped just now to do some good work and put some new life into the mountain states.</p>
                            <p>"Denver will lose no time in finding a chance to honor W. J. Bryan and incidentally call the attention of the country to the fact that it will take more than a political defeat to destroy the hopes and blast the prospects of that energetic city.  Salt Lake can do more.  A movement can be started now to pull the Western states together in a great reciprocal trade movement which will put the industrial interests of the inter-mountain states before the people who have money to burn.  No matter what regrets we have over the results of the election we must recognize that money will be easier at least temporarily and the states offering the best inducements will get the greatest proportion of the money that will be turned loose during the next four months.</p>
                            <p>"The Transmississippi congress was to have been held in Salt Lake in October.  The time of meeting was postponed until after election.  W. J. Bryan is the president of this congress and it is to be held in Salt Lake City.  The State of Utah is to have a semi-centennial celebration next summer and an intermountain fair ought to be held in connection with that event to exhibit the resources of the greatest undeveloped region of the United States&#8212;the group of intermountain states&#8212;Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada and Montana.</p>
                            <p>"The Transmississippi exposition will be held in Omaha in 1898 and the legislatures of the various states west of the Mississippi will be called upon to make appropriations during the first three months of 1897.  The great opportunity of the western states is now opened up.  If action is ever taken effectively to offset the work of the past few years in the southern states it must be done soon.  Gold mines give us the first point for advertisings (i. e.) push the button and the necessity for preparatory work for our semi-centennial celebration and the Transmississippi exposition will do the rest.</p>
                            <p>"Omaha, Denver and all other Western cities are interested and will co-operate with Salt Lake.  Now throw all these points together and we must conclude that Salt Lake ought to get a great big move on herself.  The Transmississippi congress ought to called to to meet here in December.</p>
                            <p>"W. J. Bryan will be the president and the guest of honor.  The members of the legislatures of the inter-mountain states must be invited and men of national reputation must be put upon the list of speakers and given topics which will enable them to discuss the great questions affecting the development of the West&#8212;the public lands manufacturing, reciprocal trade, bimetallism, co-operation between transmississippi states, colonization, state land development and the many live issues now pressing for solution.  Utah will ask her neighbors to be profusely represented in her celebration of the settlement of the wonderful State&#8212;the fiftieth birthday of the new star, the pioneer of civilization in the great region west of the Great Divide.  Omaha will be on hand with her best men to plead for the exposition of 1898.</p>
                            <p>"The legislatures of the mountain states in joint convention assembled&#8212;preliminary to their work in January following&#8212;will profit by the discussions of this meeting and all the states will be benefited.  Utah will be a successful host and Salt Lake's people will be broadened and encouraged to enter with proper energy upon the work of 1897, which ought to be made a banner year in the history of the intermountain metropolis.  If the dead men who walk our streets can be buried or brought back to life now, 1897 will be a good year for us."</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">DENVER WOLF AND OMAHA LAMB.</hi></head>
                            <p>A wolf meeting with a lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea which should justify to the lamb himself his right to eat him.  He thus addressed him: "Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me."  "Indeed," bleated the lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."  Then said the wolf "You feed in my pasture."  "No, good sir," replied the lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."  Again said the wolf, "You drink of my well."  "No," exclaimed the lamb, "I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me."  On which the wolf seized him and ate him up, saying:  "Well I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations."&#8212;The Fables of Aesop.</p>
                            <p>This fable is forcibly recalled by the editorial which appears in the Denver News under the caption of "Omaha's Exposition."</p>
                            <p>"Successful expositions," says our Denver contemporary, "are not held in times of financial and industrial depression.  The policy as outlined by McKinley's manager and approved by The Bee is one that will bring no general prosperity to the western states.  Gold mining will doubtless be greatly stimulated, but not other industries.  Wages will be low and the consumption of all products will be kept at the minimum.  The prices of all the products of the farm, the mine, the garden, the dairy, the orchard, the quarry and the range will be on a gold standard basis, which means that the cost of production will barely be realized.  Economy will be enforced on all classes, and this means that there will be little spare cash for the making of exposition exhibits or for travel to visit the same.  These conditions are not favorable for this transmississippi enterprise and yet The Bee has done its level best to force them on the transmissouri region and on the nation."</p>
                            <p>Anybody intelligent enough to read between the lines can scarcely fail to perceive that Tom Patterson's Denver organ is simply trumping up a pretext for antagonizing the exposition because it is to be held in Omaha, instead of Denver.  If it were true&#8212;as it is not&#8212;that the election of McKinley would force down prices, curtail wages and sentence workingmen to enforce idleness and retard the resumption of prosperity, why should Omaha be held responsible?  Why should an enterprise be abandoned, which more than any other agency will make known the vast and varied resources of the greater and best half of the continent, and attract capital and population for their development?  Has anything happened since the election of McKinley to justify these gloomy forebodings, and dolorous prophecies?  Has not the assurance of financial stability and prospective restoration of the protective policy already caused a marked advance in the price of the products of the farm, orchard and dairy?  Has it not already increased the value of American securities by hundreds of millions, knocked down the rates of interest at the money centers and restored $600,000,000 of gold to our money circulation?  Has not the election of McKinley already reopened the mills and factories and caused the re-employment of more than 150,000 factory hands and skilled workmen at good wages?  Out upon such arrant demagogy?  It is a disgrace to Colorado.</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Exposition will be held in Omaha in 1898.  Whether Denver is willing to participate or not, Colorado will be creditably represented.  We do not underrate the magnitude of the enterprise or make light of the tremendous task which its prosecution imposes upon this city and state, but we can assure our wolfish friend that Omaha will prove equal to the emergency.</p>

                            <head type="main">PUSHING THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">$365,000 OF STOCK NOW SUBSCRIBED</head>
                            <head type="sub">President Wattles Certifies to the Amount to Show that the Government Appropriation is Now Available.</head>
                            <p>The eastern mail out of Omaha this afternoon bore a document of great interest to Omaha and the entire Transmississippi region, being the certificate of President Gurdon W. Wattles of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association addressed to the honorable secretary of the treasury of the United States, notifying that officer that the conditions surrounding the appropriation of $200,000 by the government for a building and exhibit at the exposition have been complied with.  The condition specified in the act passed at the last session of congress was that the exposition association should secure subscriptions of stock amounting to at least $250,000 before an appropriation would be made by congress, and pledging an appropriation of $200,000 in case the amount named was subscribed.  President Wattles' certificate notifies the secretary of the treasury that the exposition association has secured stock subscriptions amounting to $365,000.</p>
                            <p>The same mail also carried a copy of this certificate, addressed to Congressman David H. Mercer, together with a number of facts and details connected with the exposition work.  The certificate and papers accompanying it were drawn in accordance with the suggestions offered by Mr. Mercer, who has promised to do all in his power to induce the president to issue his proclamation to the governments of the world, informing them of the proposed exposition and inviting them to make exhibits thereat.</p>
                            <p>Subscriptions to stock, which were held off until the result of the election was known, are coming in at an encouraging rate.  Among the matter which have been hanging fire largely on this account was the subscription list of the brewers in Omaha and of the brewers in outside cities who do business in Omaha.  The home brewers subscribed $5,000 each, on condition that the outside brewers subscribe amounts in proportion to the amount of business done by them in Omaha.  At the same time the home brewers indicated the respective amounts they considered the outside dealers should contribute.  Committees visited the headquarters of the outside brewers and endeavored to secure subscriptions, which would comply with the conditions referred to.  A voluminous correspondence was carried on and the result was that the outside brewers refused to subscribe anywhere near the amounts indicated.  For instance, the amount that the home brewers thought the Schlitz Brewing company should subscribe was $3,750, but the officers of that company refused to subscribe more than $500.  This was finally pushed up to $1,000 after hard work on the part of the soliciting committee, and this amount was accepted.  The same procedure in the case of the other outside brewers resulted in the following subscriptions:  Anheuser-Busch company, St. Louis, $650; Pabst, Milwaukee, $500; W. J. Lemp Brewing company, St. Louis, $500; Schoenhofer Brewing company, Chicago, $300.  The home brewers then reduced their subscriptions and the Metz Brewing company, Krug Brewing company and Omaha Brewing association each subscribed $3,000, and the South Omaha Brewing association, $1,000.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield received notice this morning from Lucien Wells, chairman of the Council Bluffs soliciting committee, that he had $4,000 of subscriptions from residents of the sister city, which he would forward at once to the secretary.</p>
                            <p>The subscription list has been swelled by subscriptions of $1,000 each, from Kelley, Stiger &amp; Co., and Browning, King &amp; Co.</p>
                            <p>The committee which has been canvassing the railway and other large corporations, all of which refused to subscribe before the election, reports encouraging prospects of substantial subscriptions from these corporations.  The latter has been laid before the reviewing officers of all of the large corporations, and definite results are expected very soon.</p>
                            <p>Henry P. Steel, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade of Denver, has been appointed by the governor of Colorado as vice president of the exposition association for that state.</p>
                            <p>The commission appointed by Governor Holcomb to look after the Nebraska exhibit at the exposition to be held at Nashville, Tenn., next year, has called upon the officers of the Transmississippi exposition and expressed a desire to work in harmony with them in making a creditable exhibit at Nashville and working in the interest of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

                            <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 14.&#8212;(Special Correspondence of The Bee.)&#8212;Nashville people like to refer to their city as the "Athens of the South," presumably as corresponding for the new world to the position the Greek metropolis held as the seat of learning for the old world.  On this point, however, it is idle to dispute.  Nashville is a city of beautiful churches, excellent young women's seminaries and numerous pretty girls.  The churches are scattered well all over town, their steeples and spires piercing the sky at every point of the compass.  The young women's seminaries are located here and there in nearly all the fashionable residence quarters.  The pretty girls are omnipresent&#8212;walking, driving, riding in the street cars, but above all marching two and two in processions, strictly boarding-school fashion, headed usually by two grim-visaged teachers and trailed up in the rear by a lynx-eyed sentry.  In the printed statements of Nashville's resources and attractions it is asserted that it boasts in addition to its nineteen magnificent public schools over eighty universities, colleges, seminaries, academics, and private schools, and contains during the school year a non-resident school population of over 5,000.  While this makes it impossible to attribute to Nashville the parentage of all the pretty girls to be seen on its streets, it is certainly highly creditable to the region from which this part of the population is drawn.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Nashville just now is in a state of impatient and feverish expectation of great results to accrue from the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, which is to be held in this city from May to November, 1897.  The exposition is a decided go.  It has been taken up by the whole people of Tennessee and especially the energetic and public-spirited citizens of Nashville, and it will without doubt be opened on schedule time, substantially complete and in every respect ready for public inspection.  The Nashville exposition has a two-fold aspect.  It is to be the crowning fete of the centennial anniversary of Tennessee's statehood and an exhibition of the resources and products of the Volunteer state and the territory immediately surrounding or tributary to it.  In the enterprise have been centered not only patriotism and state pride, but individual public spirit and the private determination of the managers not to be behind in comparison with other similar undertakings of like scope and purpose.  The project is notable for the harmonious co-operation of its promoters.  Not even on the question of the site was there any acrimonious contest.  Two locations were taken into consideration, but the one chosen was so preeminently superior and better adapted to the proposed exposition that its selection was practically without dissent among the directors who had the matter in charge.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The managers of the Tennessee Centennial exposition call attention with great satisfaction to the fact that they have undertaken no part of the work without first having the money in sight with which to pay for it.  They have already spent about $315,000 with few obligations yet to be met and numerous prospective obligations to be created and met before the gates are opened.  The way this money has been raised is a grand testimonial to the enterprise of the men who are behind it.  The state of Tennessee has thus far contributed nothing whatever in the shape of funds.  The last legislature, however, passed a law authorizing counties and cities to make donations and under this law the city of Nashville voted $100,000 in bonds, which were turned over to the exposition management and sold for its benefit: the county of Davidson, in which Nashville is situated, donated $50,000 in county warrants; Shelby county, in which Memphis is located, voted $25,000, and other counties that have acted have swelled the funds by $35,000 more.  Knox county, of which Knoxville is the seat, is expected to make a liberal contribution and a bill will be brought up before the coming legislature and passed by which $200,000 will be fixed as the donation of the state of Tennessee.  This is all aside from the bill pending in congress for an appropriation of $240,000 for a government building and exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The stock subscriptions by individuals and private corporations, while already mounting to a handsome figure, are regarded generally as merely first installments, to be increased all around as the necessities of the exposition require.  The liberality of the railroads toward the huge undertaking stands in marked contrast with the usual attitude of the railroads that profit by Omaha's patronage.  The lines entering Nashville have given outright $50,000 in 100-cent United States dollars, besides as much again in transportation for both passengers and freight.  As there are really only two systems terminating in Nashville&#8212;the Louisville &amp; Nashville and the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis&#8212;this means $25,000 in cash apiece.  In addition to this, three or four connecting southern railroads have given $1,000 each and transportation almost without limit.  The subscription of the Nashville Street Railway company is $7,500, of the gas company, $3,000; of the electric lighting company, $1,500; the principal newspapers, $500, and an additional amount to be taken in advertising; from the three leading hotels, $2,500 each and something from every smaller hostelry and public boarding house.  The largest individual subscription is $4,000 and the smallest received $5.  But as all of these are viewed as first payments, to be increased later, most of them will reach much larger figures in the end.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>I went out to the exposition grounds yesterday and verified for myself everything that had been told me about the progress of the work.  The park contains 200 acres, only slightly hilly and partially wooded, with three artificial lakes recently constructed.  It lies within the suburbs of Nashville just beyond the building belonging to Vanderbilt university.  The walks and drainage and water supply are finished and three-fourths of the exposition buildings substantially completed.  The buildings are modeled very much on the order of the World's fair architecture, on not quite so colossal a scale, yet large, commodious and well lighted.  They are, all with one exception, of heavy frame covered with staffs 
                            
                            <pb n="289" xml:id="TMISB01-289"/>
                            
                            beautifully moulded and snowy white.  The exception is the art gallery, which is an exact reproduction of the old Athenian Parthenon, which is built as a permanent structure with brick walls and steel and glass roof.  The statuary on the pediment is not yet placed, but otherwise it is complete even to the red and blue color ornamentation of the cornice.  Other unique features are a miniature of the great Egyptian pyramid, which is being erected for Shelby county; a reproduction of the far-famed Rialto, two long arbors to be covered one with vines and the other with gourds.  The amusement end of the grounds is to be designated "Vanity Fair," and is already ornamented with the pagoda towers of the Chinese village.  Everywhere are bandstands and flagstaffs.  There is an auditorium with seating capacity for 6,000 and a tower 140 feet high.  There is to be no special building for electricity exhibits, it being the design to have the electrical displays mostly by night in the form of illuminations of all the buildings and grounds.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>While Tennessee is expected to occupy the central place in the exhibits, the scope of the exposition is to be by no means confined to a single state.  The entire south is expected to come to its support, as it came to the support of the Cotton States' Exposition at Atlanta.  An unprecedented and unexcelled display of marbles and building stones is promised, among them several unique designs.  In tobacco and cotton also special effort is to be made to secure good representation.  For foreign exhibits, the management is acting on the theory that the only way to get them is to go after them and has employed as foreign commissioner a man who acted in the same capacity for the Atlanta and San Francisco expositions, and who is now in Europe, arranging for filling this department of the great show.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The plan of organization of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition will doubtless be of interest to the people of Omaha just now when they are about to effect the permanent organization of their Transmississippi Exposition.  The full conception of the Nashville venture was developed in 1895.  The original intention was to have opened it on June 1, 1896, the centennial anniversary of the admission of Tennessee into the union.  But the shortness of the time for preparation prompted a postponement until May, 1897, while the anniversary was celebrated with memorial exercises and the dedication of the exposition grounds.  For the active management of the enterprise an exposition company was formed.  The exposition stock is divided into share of $5 each.  The stockholders elected a directory of 200, which meets once each month.  The board of directors elected a president, three vice presidents, director general and other officers, and an executive committee, having all the powers of the board of directors when the board is not in session.  The executive committee has immediate control of the exposition affairs, outlines policies, and passes on each appropriation above $500, to which amount the director general is authorized to contract.  The system of expenditure is exact, requiring requisition from a department on the director general, and the signature sanction of the director general before a debt is created, and the signature of the director general, chief of department and auditor on an explanatory voucher before the debt is paid by the treasurer.  The president and vice presidents, board of directors, executive committee and a majority of the officers and chiefs of departments of the exposition serve without salary.  The officers are as follows:</p>
                            <p>Executive department:  John W. Thomas, president; V. L. Kirkman, Nashville, vice president; W. A. Henderson, Knoxville, vice president; John Overton, jr., Memphis, vice president; Charles E. Currey, secretary.</p>
                            <p>Executive committee:  E. E. Barthell, Horace H. Lurton, J. W. Thomas, Jr., A. H. Robinson, Samuel M. Murphy, W. L. Dudley, G. H. Baskette, E. W. Cole, J. H. McDowell, Tully Brown, M. J. Dalton, Luke E. Wright, Horace E. Palmer, W. H. Jackson, J. W. Baker, J. H. Fall, J. Vanderventer, John J. McCann, J. C. Neely, B. F. Wilson, Thomas D. Fite, H. W. Buttorff.</p>
                            <p>Officers in charge:  E. C. Lewis, director general; W. H. Bruce, chief clerk; A. W. Wills, commissioner general; S. J. Keith, chairman finance committee; S. A. Champion, general consul; Frank Goodman, auditor; W. P. Tanner, treasurer; C. T. Berry, bookkeeper.</p>
                            <p>Woman's board:  Mrs. Van Leer Kirkman, president; Miss Ada Scott Rice, secretary.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Aside from the exposition, Nashville has its share of attractions for the visitor.  Most interesting is the state house, whose construction dates from back in 1845, and cost $1,500,000.  It is of severe classical design, perched high upon the most prominent hill in the city, and visible for miles around.  It is handsomely finished in the interior and filled with the usual relics bearing upon the history of the state.  There are pictures of Jackson and Polk and other prominent Tennesseans and a queer portrait of a fat, chubby old woman labeled "Mrs. Andrew Jackson."  Out on the campus is the famous bronze equestrian statue of Old Hickory, the huge piece of metal balanced to a nicety on the hind legs of the rearing animal.  A little further on is the marble canopy monument over the remains of President James K. Polk and his wife.  The inscriptions recite how Polk had been honored with almost every public position within the gift of the people, and had died in 1849 beloved and mourned by all.  He was buried by special permit of the Nashville city council in the front yard of his own residence, and the monument was first erected there.  The story of its removal illustrates how some great men miss great opportunities and precipitate great quarrels among their survivors.</p>
                            <p>Tennessee, it seems, provides no official residence for its governor, and does not even make an appropriation to reimburse him for his house rent.  Polk was childless, and had no relatives except his wife dependent on him.  He had been governor of Tennessee.  Here was his opportunity to leave his home to the state for use as an executive mansion, and then if he wanted to be buried in his front yard he would be sure of having a resting place on public ground cared for by the state.  But he did nothing of the kind.  He made a will, or rather tried to make a will.  He left the property to his wife during her lifetime, and then for occupancy during their lives by the most meritorious person in the Polk family bearing the name of Polk, the question of merit to be decided by the legislature.  Mrs. Polk did not die until 1891.  The heirs immediately objected to the will, and took it into court with the result that it was smashed to smithereens.  The property will soon have to be sold for the benefit of the estate, and the proceeds divided among some fifty of the Polk kith and kin.  The remains of the ex-president and his wife had to be removed to the capitol grounds, and the beautiful monument torn down and rebuilt.  No one knows into whose hands the Polk house may fall, or for what purpose it may be used, and the state of Tennessee is still without an executive mansion, and its governor, on that account, usually absent from the capitol.</p>

                            <p>The committee that has had in charge the work of soliciting subscriptions for stock in the Transmississippi Exposition among the laboring men has called a mass meeting of the executive officers of all the labor organizations in Douglas county, and the members who have subscribed for stock.  The meeting is to be held this evening at 8 o'clock at Labor temple.</p>

                            <p>It is probable that the Iowa legislature will again be invited to join the Trans-Mississippi association organized for the purpose of booming Omaha lots.  This state has no real interest in Nebraska real estate speculations and should not become a member of any outside advertising bureau.  Iowa has done well by Nebraska.  Our wives have donated our old clothes to the people of that common-wealth until many of us have been short on wearing apparel during the unexpected hard times of the past year or two.  They have shown their by calling us all sorts of insects during the campaign and sent a presidential candidate through Iowa scattering a paris green political destruction powder.  The people of this state will forgive them of all their sins provided they do not insist upon the legislature subscribing for stock in the Omaha real estate agency.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ALL READY TO VOTE FOR DIRECTORS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Over Two-Thirds of the Stockholders Pay Up, Representing a Large Majority of the Subscriptions.</head>
                            <p>One of the busiest places in Omaha yesterday was the office of Secretary Wakefield of the Transmississippi Exposition company.  Yesterday was the last day for paying the first installment on stock to enable the holders to vote for directors of the company, and from the number who paid it appears that a great majority of the stockholders are desirous of having their say as to who shall direct the affairs of the exposition.  Secretary Wakefield was not able to state last evening just how much of the stock had been paid on, but was confident that over two-thirds of the stockholders had paid up.  As to what percentage of the stock this represented he was unable to state until he had had time to foot up the cash book and enter up a large amount which had come in the mail in the form of checks.  At 9 o'clock last evening there was a large stack of letters on his desk which he was just starting to open and with few exceptions these contained remittances from stockholders and as a rule they were from the large subscribers.</p>
                            <p>"Practically all of the large subscribers have paid, as far as I can remember," said Mr. Wakefield.  "I have not yet run across the check of the Burlington, but there are a large number of letters to be gone through with.  I understand that the check has been mailed, however.  The gas company, the street railway company and Frank Murphy, representing the next largest subscription, is paid so far as this assessment is concerned, as are also most of the heavy subscriptions.</p>
                            <p>"The manner in which the subscribers have come up with these payments is most encouraging to the directory and the friends of the exposition and will go a long way to convince the authorities at Washington of the bona fide character of the stock subscription.</p>
                            <p>"It would be impossible at this time to tell how much of the stock has been paid on," said Mr. Wakefield at 9 o'clock last night.  "As I said a moment ago, the amounts contained in that pile of letters have not yet been entered on the cash book, and they represent a large amount of stock and I have made no effort to foot up the cash book as far as the entries have been made; neither have I had time to make any count of the cash taken in and it will probably be almost this time Sunday night before I will be able to give an accurate statement."</p>

                            <head type="sub">SEVERAL INFORMAL BALLOTS TAKEN</head>
                            <head type="sub">Regular Meeting Will Be Held Mondays, at Which Proxies of Those Who Cannot Attend Sessions Will Be Disposed Of.</head>
                            <p>The gentlemen who have taken stock in the Transmississippi Exposition were called by Chairman Wells of the finance committee to meet in the city building last evening for the purpose of completing the payment of the 5 per cent assessment and discussing the part that the Council Bluffs capitalists are to take in determining who shall be members of the board of directors and the selection of a site for the Exposition.  There was but a small percentage of the stockholders present, but those who braved the cold or left Saturday evening business took a deep interest in the discussions.</p>
                            <p>The report of the finance committee showed that the assessment had been generally paid, and that all of the Council Bluffs stock would be voted at the meeting to be held in Omaha on December 1.</p>
                            <p>The question of the number of directors that the paid-up stock subscriptions would entitle Council Bluffs to was discussed, and it was believed that the Iowa stockholders would be entitled to at least two.  A vote was taken for the purpose of indicating the wishes of the stockholders present as to who these two directors should be.  Lucius Wells received the largest number of votes, and M. F. Rohrer, A. S. Hazelton and E. F. Test followed in the order named.  Mr. Wells thanked the stockholders for their complimentary vote, but declared that he was not a candidate for the directory.  The question of selecting the <choice><sic>candiates</sic><corr>candidates</corr></choice> was left undecided and will be determined before Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>The matter of proxies brought forth a good deal of discussion.  The fact that only a very small percentage of the stockholders was present at the meeting last night was taken as a good indication that only a proportionate amount of the stock would be represented by its owners in Tuesday's meeting, and it was deemed necessary to take some steps that would be effective in securing the proxies of all stockholders who could not be present at the Omaha meeting.  For this purpose the finance committee was instructed to secure the proxies of all who could not attend the meeting.  Chairman Wells and other members of the finance committee demurred to this, and declared that about four members of that committee had done all of the work for the exposition that had been done.  They desired to have a special committee appointed to do this work.  A motion to this effect was made and carried, and A. S. Hazelton, who occupied the chair, named ex-Mayor J. H. Cleaver, W. A. Maurer and Dr. Robertson.  They were instructed to co-operate with the finance committee, and to complete their work by Monday noon.  They were instructed to prepare a notice for the morning papers, calling for the proxies of absent stockholders to be delivered not later than 10 o'clock Monday.</p>
                            <p>After the adjournment of the meeting the special committee prepared the following notice:</p>
                            <p>All subscribers to the Transmississippi Exposition stock who cannot attend the meeting on December 1 are requested to call at the office of Deere, Wells &amp; Co., in the Sapp block, today from 11 to 12 and on Monday before 10 o'clock, and leave their proxies to be voted in the interest of Council Bluffs in the election of the board of directors and the selection of a site for the Exposition.</p>

                            <p>Holdrege Citizen:  This is a good time for every loyal citizen of Nebraska to vow that during the next few months he will put in some good licks for the Transmississippi Exposition.  Every county in Nebraska should make a special effort to have its resources advertised there in some attractive manner.</p>
                            <p>Sterling Eagle:  Mr. Bryan is to be in the show business after all.  He is president of the Transmississippi congress, which is to boom the Omaha exposition, and everybody will wish him every success in that undertaking, because everybody wants Omaha's show to be a good one.  Here's luck to Bryan as a showman, and to Omaha's exposition as a show.</p>
                            <p>Kearney Hub:  Senator Allen speaks hopefully of the outlook for the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha in 1898, and pledges himself to do all in his power at the earliest possible moment to aid in securing a liberal appropriation for a government exhibit.  The prospects for the west are very bright and the business revival that will be witnessed during the coming two years will contribute to the success of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Humboldt Standard:  The Transmississippi Exposition is the next thing to turn our attention to, and our people should see to it that no stone is left unturned to make the display one that will reflect credit on our fair state.  With the present pace kept up, by the time the exposition opens the entire country will be enjoying a season of unparalleled prosperity, and we should put away from us the gloomy past and look out on the bright future, which is evidently in store for all.  Boom the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Tilden Citizen:  Every enterprising citizen of this great commonwealth is watching with increasing interest the preparations being made for the Transmississippi Exposition in Omaha during the year 1898 and hoping for its unqualified success.  The transmississippi region can put up an exhibition that would scarcely be excelled by the great Chicago show if the states composing it would lend their united aid toward making the necessary arrangements.  Here's to the success of the exposition; may it be worthy the name of the Queen of American exhibitions.</p>
                            <p>Hildreth Telescope:  Some of the papers over the state, it is needless to say they are of the calamity howling class, are worrying themselves for fear the next legislature will make an appropriation for the coming exposition at Omaha.  There undoubtedly will be an appropriation made, and it is right that there should be.  The cry that it is a scheme to boom Omaha at the expense of the state is the silliest kind of bosh.  This exposition will be a grand thing for Nebraska.  It will attract vast multitudes to our state, and they will not stop with a visit to Omaha, but will go all over the state.  Nebraska needs something to set her straight with the world, and the Omaha exposition is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
                            <p>Minden Gazette:  Every citizen who has the development and progress of Nebraska truly at heart will constitute himself a committee of one to help push along the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha.  The time is none too long to make it what it can and should be.  The man who hangs back because he thinks it only a scheme to boom Omaha is simply too narrow-minded, on general principles, to be a thorough Nebraskan.  That which helps Omaha, or any other town in Nebraska, helps the whole state.  Nebraska doesn't begin to be settled up yet.  We have room</p>

                            <head type="sub">Over Three-Fourths of the Total Stock Subscriptions Respond to the Call for the First Assessment.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Sunday is a day on which the most people expect to rest, but Secretary Wakefield of the Transmississippi and International Exposition company and his office force were deprived of any opportunity to show what they could do in that line.  It was not until 11 o'clock last night that they completed the work of entering up the payments on stock subscriptions made the day before and making the totals.  It was necessary that the work should be completed at once, for the election of directors takes place Tuesday and unless this work is all done it would be impossible to tell who had a right to vote.  Some idea of the amount of labor involved can be formed from the fact that there are 6,315 subscribers to the stock of the exposition company and of this number 4,247 have paid the first assessment on the stock.  Some of these paid in earlier, but by far the greater portion of them sent or brought their money in during the last few days.</p>
                            <p>Saturday night Mr. Wakefield stated that he was confident fully two-thirds of the stockholders had paid up the assessment and the figures show he was correct, the number being a trifle in excess of that.  Figured on the number of shares there is considerable more than two-thirds of the stock paid on.  In round numbers there is a total subscription of 37,000 shares and the first payment has been made on 29,000 of these.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">EVERYBODY FEELS ENCOURAGED.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield went home last night very tired, but feeling very much encouraged over the prospects of the exposition and the same may be said of all the officers and men who have had anything to do with pushing the project.  One of the most important things just now is to secure a favorable report from the secretary of the treasury on the certificate of the officers that the requisite amount of stock had been subscribed to meet the conditions of the act passed at the last session of congress.  That act pledged the government of the United States to make an appropriation of $200,000 for a government exhibit when $250,000 of bona fide stock subscriptions had been secured.  The officials of the exposition company sent a certificate to the secretary some time ago, setting forth the fact that such subscription had been made, but this can now be supplemented with the statement that more than the amount specified by the government had been paid up as far as it is assessable this year under the terms of the subscription.  If there had ever been any doubt as to the securing of a favorable report this prompt and almost universal response to the call for payment on the stock should remove it.</p>
                            <p>The heavy payment on stock also demonstrates that the people of this city are in dead earnest on the exposition question.  Talk is cheap, but when a community puts up its money for any enterprise it is in earnest.</p>
                            <p>Tomorrow occurs the election of the permanent directors of the exposition company who will have charge of the actual work of creating the big show, and as soon as they are inducted into office active preparation for the fair itself will be commenced and pushed through with all possible dispatch.  There is no time to lose and the promoters of the enterprise realize this.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MUCH WORK TO DO.</head>
                            <p>In addition to completing the work of securing further subscriptions, the appropriation of a suitable amount for the representation of the state and the actual appropriation of money by the federal government there is a vast amount of preliminary work to be done before the actual work of preparing the grounds and the buildings for the great fair can be commenced.  The enterprise has progressed sufficiently, however, that the directors can take this up and have everything in readiness for active operations as soon as the weather will permit in the spring.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen and Congressman Mercer are hopeful, in case a favorable report is secured from the secretary of the treasury at an early date, of having the appropriation for the exposition tacked onto the urgency deficiency bill, which is the first appropriation measure to get through congress and is usually enacted into law before the Christmas holidays.  In case this is done it will enable the government to proceed at once with its plans and will be of great service in securing appropriations from other state legislatures to have their states represented.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FIVE PLACES PROMINENTLY MENTIONED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Something About the Various Places and the Advantages They Offer and the Means of Communication with the City.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Since the Transmississippi Exposition seems to be assured the question of the particular piece of ground upon which the great fair shall be located has assumed prominence and the advocates of some of the sites which have been suggested have become most aggressive in their efforts to secure every advantage in the election of directors of the Transmississippi association, in order that their favorite site may be chosen.  So determined did this fight become that it threatened to engulf every other consideration and this, of itself, formed one of the principal reasons why it was decided to postpone the election of directors until December 1, instead of holding it October 1, as was intended.  Some of the business men present at the meeting at which the postponement was urged upon the present directory expressed the opinion that by postponing the election some of the pernicious activity might die out and men would be chosen as directors who would decide the question of location purely upon its merits and without regard to local influences and advantages.</p>
                            <p>However this may be, there are a number of sites which have been proposed and which will be presented to the directors when the proper time comes.  All of these have their earnest supporters and all have their advantages, and it has developed very strongly that the duty of picking out the particular spot upon which the multitude of buildings shall be located will be one of the most difficult of the many duties devolving upon the board of directors.</p>
                            <p>Up to this time five sites have been brought to public notice.  The advocates of some of these have been more aggressive than others, but all have been given more or less prominence.  These sites are as follows:  East Omaha, Elmwood park, Miller park, Riverview park and a large plat of ground lying west and northwest of Hanscom park.  These sites offer a great scope as to topography.  Some are flat as a floor, others are decidedly the reverse, while others are a combination of these extremes.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">EAST OMAHA'S ADVANTAGES.</head>
                            <p>"East Omaha" is the name given to a site lying north of the locality usually designated by that name.  As applied to the exposition it refers to a tract of ground lying between Cut-Off and Florence lakes.  There are nearly a thousand acres which are available for exposition purposes.  The ground is as level as a floor, dotted liberally with trees of a mature growth and plentifully supplied with water.  On the south is Cut-Off lake, a crescent-shaped body of water about two and one-half miles in length and nearly a quarter of a mile in width at some points.  On the east is the Missouri river and the advocates of this site claim that the water of the river may be diverted into the two lakes named and also into such lagoons and smaller lakes as may be desired and then returned to the river again. thus making running water in all of the lakes.</p>
                            <p>The supporters of this location call attention to the fact that the minimum of grading will be necessary in order to put the ground in shape for the erection of buildings, but they lay particular stress upon the fact that an unlimited supply of water is at hand, which may be utilized by simply turning it in any direction without having to pay for the water.  The accessibility of the site is also made a prominent argument in favor of locating the exposition there.  It is pointed out that it is less than three miles in a direct line from the postoffice and that there are already railroad tracks galore within a short distance of it, and plenty of room for more.  A paved street, Sixteenth, already extends almost to the spot, and the new bridge across the Missouri river makes the site readily accessible from the Iowa side.  This location has been in strong favor with Council Bluffs people and it has been announced a number of times that Council Bluffs would  refuse to subscribe to exposition stock unless the East Omaha site was selected.  This report is partially supported by the fact that the list of Council Bluffs subscriptions so far filed with the secretary of the Transmississippi association contains subscriptions amounting to only $4,000.</p>

                            <p>At the opposite side of the city lies another site which has been prominently mentioned as a desirable location for the great exposition, viz.:  Elmwood park.  This is a public park. 215 acres in extent, lying three and one-half miles west of the postoffice.  The park was acquired by the city in 1890, a part of the present tract being donated and the remainder purchased by the city.  Nearly $50,000 has been expended in beautifying the park and it has become a popular resort.  The land is rolling in character, with a deep "draw" or ravine running through it which might be transformed into a lake of considerable extent.  Several natural springs in the eastern part of the park furnish a considerable quantity of water and the park board has expended a large sum of money in boring an artesian well, but without any marked success as yet.  The State fair grounds are located directly south of this park and the use of this site for exposition purposes contemplates the use of the 160 acres contained in the fair grounds.  The site is reached by one line of street cars and three railway lines.</p>
                            <p>On the north side of the city is Miller park, another public park which has been suggested and urged as a proper location for the exposition.  This park covers eighty acres and has a gradual slope.  It is about four miles from the postoffice and great stress is laid upon the fact that the streets leading to it are all of light grade.  Two lines of street cars run nearly to the park and the advocates of this site represent that two other lines may be extended to that point without great expense.  The location is provided with sewer facilities and the large main of the water works company passes near the park.  There is no natural water available for lakes.  The supporters of this site have secured leases to surrounding property to the extent of about 400 acres, and the abandoned army post, Fort Omaha, lies immediately to the west, making about 550 acres which would be available for exposition purposes.</p>

                            <head type="sub">RIVERVIEW PARK.</head>
                            <p>In the southeastern part of the city is Riverview park, another public park which has been prominently before the public for some time as a site for the exposition.  This park contains sixty-six acres and is situated a little over two miles from the postoffice.  The land comprising this park is very hilly for the most part, but the advocates of this location as a site for the exposition have secured leases on land adjoining the park on the north and west and also on the level ground lying southeast of the park, aggregating about 300 acres in extent.  The hilly character of the park itself is urged as a strong argument why it should be chosen as a site.  It is proposed to construct a viaduct over the railroad tracks lying between the park proper and the low ground adjoining on the southeast, and also to construct a pontoon bridge across the Missouri river to the Iowa side, landing passengers from the east at the end of the bridge and bringing them across by means of vehicles.  The main argument upon which the advocates of this site rely is its proximity to the center of the city.  The Tenth street line already runs to a point within a short distance of the park and the Sixth street, Thirteenth street and Sixteenth street lines, it is argued could easily be extended to the park, while railroad facilities could be provided on the east side.</p>
                            <p>There is another site which has met with very strong favor with those who see what they regard as almost fatal objections to the other sites which have been mentioned.  This is a piece of ground, about 200 acres in extent, lying west and northwest of Hanscom park.  This tract is bounded on the south by Center street, on the north by Pacific, on the east by Thirty-third street, and extents west to the county road in the rear of the county hospital, the grounds belonging to the poor farm proper not being included in the plat.  In the main this is a level tableland, sloping slightly to the west, where a valley is formed through which the Belt Line railway passes.  Beyond the Belt Line the ground rises again, reaching almost the same level as the eastern portion.  This formation gives a rolling aspect to the site, which its advocates claim would afford the most picturesque site for the erection of beautiful buildings.  It is nearer the center of the city than any of the other sites, being two miles away from the postoffice.  It is accessible from all directions and may be reached from almost any direction on paved streets.  The plans advanced by the supporters of this location include, also, a chain of lakes extending in a northeasterly direction from Thirty-third and Pacific streets to about Thirtieth and Davenport streets, a point less than one mile from the postoffice.  This takes in the valley in which was formerly a creek and would afford an excellent boulevard for an entrance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION ELECTION TO BE HELD TONIGHT</head>
                            <head type="sub">Ruling of Secretary Wakefield on Proxies Causes Much Dissatisfaction Among Stockholders Who Desire to Pay Up.</head>
                            <p>The election of the new board of directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association, which is scheduled at the Board of Trade hall at 7 o'clock tonight, is regarded as one of the most important junctures in preliminary work for the exposition.  This idea seems to be thoroughly shared by the smaller stockholders, for with a unanimity far beyond the expectations of the managers they have paid up the assessment on their stock in order to vote on the question.</p>
                            <p>When the books were closed Saturday night nearly $300,000 of the stock subscribed had been paid on, and yesterday Secretary Wakefield and his clerks were kept busy all day receiving additional payments.  They claim to be too busy to give any information today, but it is apparent that practically the entire assessment has been paid in.</p>
                            <p>A number of stockholders who have been unable to attend to their payments the day before were on hand with their cash this morning, but received no satisfaction.  They were told that they could pay if they wanted to, but no receipts could be issued; that proxies would not be certified to and that they could not vote tonight.  The receipts would be mailed to them as soon as the rush of business was over.  Among those who received this reply were a number of city officials, and they are considerably worked up over the matter.  They assert that Secretary Wakefield should have hired an additional clerk for a day or two if necessary, as he knew the rush that was coming and should have prepared to meet it.</p>
                            <p>The difficulty in getting proxies registered is creating no little discontent among stockholders, both big and little.  In some instances registration has been refused on the ground that the same party had already given his proxy to some one else.  Speaking about proxies, a lawyer of considerable experience in corporation matters said to-day:</p>
                            <p>"A proxy is simply empowering another person to vote for you in your absence.  It does not have to be registered to be legal.  A man may give a proxy and revoke it at any time and then by giving a second and later proxy revoke the first one.  He can appear at the stockholders' meeting in person and exercise his own right to vote without regard to previously given proxies.  The refusal to recognize a legally executed proxy would cause trouble and give ground for attacking the validity of an election held under such a ruling."</p>
                            <p>There is a great deal of mystery about some features of the election tonight and a good many stockholders are very curious to know something in regard to one or two slates that have been incubated under the hat and which are still studiously concealed.  They have the impression that the largest stockholders have united on a list of names with sufficient votes behind them to elect them, but the men who are reported to be behind the movement say they know nothing about it.</p>
                            <p>An effort has been made by some persons to allow stock to be voted cumulatively, but this will not be allowed under any circumstances.  Any stockholder can cast as many votes as he holds shares of stock for each of fifty men, but he will not be allowed to concentrate his votes on any less number.</p>

                            <p>The new exposition directory has now been elected, and as a whole its personnel will commend it to public confidence.</p>
                            <p>The reorganization and enlargement of the board was primarily designed to open the way for fuller representation of all classes of contributors and to broaden the scope of the management.  That object was partially thwarted by the star chamber combinations which insisted on excluding some of the most public-spirited and experienced men and forced into the board some who had no claim to such recognition.  The most short-sighted part of the combine's policy was the failure to consider the claims of the wage working class.  The workingmen have contributed more, according to their means, than any of the wealthy corporations or individuals, and are entitled to participate in the exposition management.  It is within the power of the new board to rectify this error, and it is to be hoped it will improve the opportunity, in the interest of the success of the exposition project.</p>
                            <p>It is scarcely necessary for The Bee to emphasize the importance and necessity of efficient and capable officers and executive committee, upon whom the greater part of the actual work and responsibility will devolve.</p>

                            <l>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</l>
                            <p>Denver, Colo., Dec. 1.&#8212;The Rocky Mountain News tomorrow morning will print the following in its editorial columns:</p>
                            <p>"The Omaha Bee continues to slur the devotion of the silver states to Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Bryan himself, at every possible opportunity.  At the same time it is trying to work up interest in the Trans-Mississippi exposition and expect those people whom it is constantly slandering and blackguarding to dance attendance on that show.  These 'silver lunatics' and 'anarchists' and 'repudiationists' will be very slow in accepting the invitation of the Bee.  That traitorous sheet has made this industrial project an issue in politics and used it as a means of ruining the industries of the mountain states.  There will have to be some very satisfactory explanation if these states take anything more than a passing interest in this exposition.  Mr. Bryan's connection with it will do more than all other agencies combined to secure the favor of the silver communities in an enterprise which the Bee is doing its utmost to kill."</p>

                            <p>While the official count has not been completed has not been completed and the official result will not be announced for at least a day or two, there seems to be no doubt that the ticket bearing the names given above was elected as directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association by a large majority by the stockholders of the exposition last night in the Board of Trade hall.</p>
                            <p>The name of W. R. Bennett was "scratched" very generally on account of his public withdrawal, and it is possible that he will drop out as the county progresses.  Of the other candidates, Thomas Hoctor of South Omaha and George W. Lininger are ahead of their competitors and some of the canvassing board think one or both of these men may be elected.</p>

                            <p>When President Wattles called the meeting to order at exactly 7 o'clock the large hall was filled with holders of stock ready to vote for a board of fifty directors to manage the great exposition.  Without any unnecessary delay the meeting proceeded at once to business.  G. W. Wattles was chosen chairman of the meeting and the following stockholders were chosen to conduct the election: Judges, C. S. Montgomery, R. W. Richardson and E. J. Cornish; clerks, J. A. Wakefield, A. Hospe, jr., and W. C. Patterson; tellers, J. M. Daugherty, C. E. Ford and W. Farnam Smith.</p>
                            <p>The clerks took their seats at a long table placed at the south end of the hall and the judges and tellers retired to one of the adjoining offices and prepared to count the ballots.  The stockholders formed in a long line extending around the room and the voting commenced.</p>
                            <p>There has been no event in this city in recent years in which so much interest was manifested as this election of directors for the exposition.  The large hall in which the election was held was crowded to its utmost capacity until nearly midnight, and the halls adjoining were also filled with stockholders interested in what was going on.  Electioneering was prevalent in all quarters of the large room and in the halls.  Men with tickets were on every hand and the whole proceeding resembled nothing so much as an old-fashioned primary election.</p>
                            <p>There were three tickets in the field.  The ticket made up at the meeting of stockholders held at the Commercial club rooms Monday night was one of these; the ticket named at the beginning of this article was another, both of these being printed on white paper.  The third ticket was made up of twenty-four men on the ticket which was elected, seventeen from the other tickets and the balance made up of men on neither ticket.  No one could be found who would admit the paternity of this third ticket and it did not cut any figure in the election.  The entire fight was between the other two tickets.</p>

                            <p>The ticket was successful was printed on a sheet of paper almost square in shape and was referred to as "the square ticket," while the other ticket was printed on a long, narrow strip of paper and was generally called "the long ticket."  When the square ticket appeared on the scene it was quietly whispered about that that was the only ticket to vote.  Gradually its supporters became more confident and it was openly stated that the square ticket was supported by all of the hearty stockholders, the corporations, the banks and, what seemed the pet argument of its supporters, by the present directory.</p>
                            <p>One of the most energetic supporters of Miller park as a location for the exposition has been Councilman D. H. Christie and last night he openly boasted that the question of location was settled.  "These fellows who are now directors came to us and offered to lie down," he exclaimed, "if we would elect them to the new board.  The street railway, the B. &amp; M. and all the corporations are with us and have been on our side all along.  There will be twelve votes cast which will decide the whole thing and it don't make any difference how the little fellows vote.  The square ticket is pledged to Miller park and the question of a location was settled before the voting commenced."</p>
                            <p>There was a strong sentiment of resentment manifested toward the "square ticket" by several elements which were present.  The laboring men were ignored entirely in making up the ticket, South Omaha was not represented nor was anyone known to be favorable to Riverview park on the ticket.  It was openly charged that the present board of directors had been mainly instrumental in making up the ticket and this change was born our by the fact that the entire board of the present directors were first on the ticket.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles denied that there was any thought of location in the composition of the ticket.  He said that the only thing which had actuated the makers of the ticket had been a desire to reconcile all interests and, at the same time, secure a board composed of representative citizens.  He denied that there was any understanding about the location and said that question would be settled on its merits when the proper time came.</p>

                            <p>The voting progressed very rapidly, the facilities for receiving the ballots being all that could be desired, but when it came to counting the votes the preparations were decidedly lame and a tedious delay ensued.  The counting board worked until midnight and then adjourned until this morning when its labors were resumed in one of the rooms of the Commercial club.  There were 538 ballots cast, representing 31,492 shares of stock.  The total number of shares on which the assessment had been paid is placed by the secretary at about 35,000, so that almost the full vote was cast.</p>
                            <p>Early in the progress of the balloting a protest was lodged with the election officials against allowing the stock to be voted which has been subscribed conditionally.</p>

                            <p>The task of counting the ballots cast for directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association was completed this forenoon, and this afternoon the canvassers entered upon the tabulation of the vote.</p>
                            <p>The count was very slow on account of the manner in which the ballots were scratched, and even this morning votes were found for several candidates whose names had not been found on the ballots before.  A meeting of the board of directors has been called at the Commercial club for Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock.  At this meeting it is expected that the board will be organized and preparations will be made to actively prosecute the work of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The total amount now subscribed by stockholders is $404,340.  This is by 6,468 subscribers, indicating an average subscription of about six shares.  Of these subscribers 4,720 have paid their 5 per cent assessment, making 35,087 paid up shares.  Of these, 31,492 shares were voted Tuesday night, when 538 ballots were cast.</p>
                            <p>It is now certain that the full ticket as announced by The Bee yesterday morning is elected.  G. W. Lininger received the highest vote of any of the candidates not on the winning ticket, but he lacks a good many of enough to elect.</p>

                            <p>That a new city has sprung from the dead hopes of Omaha's past and is firmly planted on the united enthusiasm and the cold cash of her citizens no one could for a moment doubt last evening at the election of the new directory for

                            the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  Business men, professional men and laboring men were all there by the hundred, and the man with the one share which was all he could afford, voted it as proudly as did the man with the 3,000 or the 1,000.</p>
                            <p>As an indication of the intense interest shown, there were voted 31,492 shares of the 34,000 in round numbers upon which the first assessment had been paid.  There were two tickets, on which was waged a sharp but friendly rivalry, and the advocates of Miller park or Riverview park, or Elmwood park, or the Belt line district each had candidates on the two tickets for whom they worked with ardor.  The laboring men had three nominees and were out in force urging their claims.  The retailers did some heroic pulling for their share of one of the tickets.  South Omaha had several active campaigners pushing about in the crowd.  Some were there to urge names not on the ballots.  But every man seemed to feel that, though he be defeated in the election, there was a greater victory for every one, himself as well.</p>

                            <p>Of the two tickets, one had been known for several days, while the other was of more recent makeup, and was said to represent the heaviest moneyed interests of the city, and good authorities say that it has been elected by an overwhelming majority.  This is the ticket:</p>
                            <p>G. W. Wattles, J. E. Markel, Dan Farrell, jr., Dudley Smith, W. R. Bennett, I. W. Carpenter, G. H. Payne, H. A. Thompson, Charles Metz, John H. Evans, C. S.

                            <p>The other ticket was the one indorsed by the citizens' mass meeting at the Commercial club rooms Monday evening, and was supposed to represent the interests of the retailers and organized

                            labor as well as the large stockholders.  This was the make-up:</p>
                            <p>G. W. Lininger, Fred M. Youngs, William H. Bell, Fred Schuebel, Henry Hardy, John Hussie, C. M. Wilhelm, A. Hospe, jr., Major R. S. Wilcox, Thomas Kilpatrick, H. A. Thompson, Fred H. Davis, John A. Creighton, E. Rosewater, George H. Payne, G. W. Wattles, Frank Murphy, A. L. Reed, O. C. Holmes, E. A. Cudahy, A. H. Noyes, A. C. Foster, G. M. Hitchcock, J. L.

Weller, J. H. Dumont, Z. T. Lindsey, Walter Jardine, Frank Colpetzer, A. R. Dufrene, Senator C. F. Manderson, J. H. Millard, W. J. Connell, James Walsh, William R. Adams, Lucius Wells, Chris Hartman, J. A. Johnson.</p>
                            <p>As will be observed, these names appeared on both tickets:  G. W. Wattles, Dan Farrell, jr., W. R. Bennett, G. H. Payne, H. A. Thompson, Thomas Kilpatrick, Frank Murphy, Z. T. Lindsey, John A. Johnson, E. Rosewater, G. M. Hitchcock, R. S. Wilcox, A. L. Reed, Walter Jardine, C. F. Manderson, John A. Creighton, J. H. Millard, A. H. Noyes, C. M. Wilhelm, J. H. Hussie, C. F. Weller, Lucius Wells, J. L. Brandeis and Alvin Saunders.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BADLY SCRATCHED.</head>
                            <p>Yet the tickets were scratched unmercifully.  The voters began on the desks before they fell in line, and then continued changing names after they were in line, using the backs of the men ahead of them for writing desks.  And so it comes about that there are on an average of ten or more scratched names on every ballot, and counting results is a long task.</p>
                            <p>At 8 o'clock proceedings began, when the stockholders present were called to order, and on motion G. W. Wattles was elected president and G. A. Wakefield secretary.  Motions were made and carried that the president appoint the necessary officers to proceed with the election of the new directory, and that the election being at once.</p>
                            <p>These were the officers appointed: Judges, J. A. Wakefield, W. F. Holmes and Ben Robideaux; tellers, R. W. Richardson, Ed J. Cornish and C. S. Montgomery; clerks, John Daugherty and W. Farnam Smith.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FORTY-FIVE MINUTE WALK.</head>
                            <p>Soon the balloting began, the voters forming in the center of the room, the long line, which made a small circle, converging into the line that marched around three sides of the room.  And it meant forty-five minutes' time to get from one end of that line to the ballot box,</p>
                            <p>When each voter arrived at the ballot box, he gave his name, and a clerk certified to the number of shares which he was entitled to vote, after which one of the judges stamped the ballot and placed upon it the number of votes which it represented.  Then it was passed on to another judge and found its way into the box.  In the case of proxies, of which there was an endless number, each proxy was looked up in the same manner as if the bearer were the original holder of the stock, unless the proxies had been previously registered at Secretary Wakefield's office.</p>
                            <p>There were enthusiastic men, such as Walter Jardine and John A. Johnson, who went out and rustled proxies and showed up in the line every few minutes as soon as they had secured them, thus passing in front of the box half a dozen times during the evening.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROTEST FILED.</head>
                            <p>At this juncture Thomas F. Sturgess filed a protest against permitting the acceptance of any votes representing stock that had been subscribed under conditions which would exempt the subscribers from collection by legal process.  This protest was in behalf of organized labor and was designed to head off certain corporations which had been reported as having made threats that no further payments would be made on any stock subscriptions unless certain conditions were fulfilled.</p>
                            <p>For the first two hours the hall was a struggling mass of men through which the long, circuitous line forced its way, and then the majority had voted and soon left for home.  For the next hour there were but few voters, although the election officers were still kept busy.  Then shortly after 11 o'clock, when the theaters were over, three gentlemen came rushing in.  The first was Senator Manderson with the Burlington vote, representing $30,000, and his own personal vote, representing $2,000 more.  Immediately followed Mr. G. M. Hitchcock with his personal vote, representing $2,000, and he was followed by Mr. W. R. Bennett with his own stock and proxies, which represented an amount in four figures.  President Wattles then mounted the platform to put the motion to adjourn for the night, when Walter
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="319" xml:id="TMISB01-319"/> -->
                            
                            Jardine straggled in, puffing like a steam engine, and offered proxies for eleven shares.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">AN ALL-NIGHT JOB.</head>
                            <p>Then it was moved that the polls be closed, and that the meeting adjourn to 9:30 o'clock this morning.  The motion was carried.  In this connection, it was announced that the counting of the ballots would be an all-night job, which the election officers did not desire to undertake, therefore the postponement until today.</p>
                            <p>During the evening a double set of ballot boxes was arranged so that the counting and voting could proceed at the same time.  After an hour's work the officers found that they had counted fifty ballots and the enormity of their job became hugely apparent.</p>
                            <p>From those that were counted, and from a hasty glance over the others as they were straightened out, the indication pointed to the election of the "official" ticket, or the one indorsed by the old directory, and commonly designated last evening as the "square ticket," owing to its shape, the other being printed on a narrow strip.</p>
                            <p>The results, however, may be affected somewhat by the fact that W. R. Bennett yesterday announced that he had withdrawn from the race, and this furnished capital for the adherents of candidates not on the printed tickets, among them being Captain Palmer and J. Y. Craig.</p>
                            <p>The men who have been at the helm ever since the inauguration of the plans for the exposition were heartily congratulating each other last evening over the interest that had been aroused, as indicated by the fact that 95 per cent of the shares eligible to representation were voted, that the most harmonious feeling prevailed, and that there was every assurance of the Trans-Mississippi exposition being a grand success.</p>
                            <p>The board of directors met this morning and adjourned from time to time during the progress of the count, that the session might be prolonged till the result became known and officially announced.  The count proceeds slowly, and it may be late this afternoon before the end shall be reached.</p>
                            <p>As an indication of how far the use of proxies was carried the 31,492 votes were cast by 538 parties.</p>

                            <p>The task of counting the ballots cast for directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association was completed yesterday forenoon, and in the afternoon the canvassers entered upon the tabulation of the vote.</p>
                            <p>The count was very slow on account of the manner in which the ballots were scratched, and even yesterday morning votes were found for several candidates whose names had not been found on the ballots before.  A meeting of the board of directors has been called at the Commercial club for Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock.  At this meeting it is expected that the board will be organized and preparations will be made to actively prosecute the work of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The total amount now subscribed by stockholders is $404,340.  This is by 6,468 subscribers, indicating an average subscription of about six shares.  Of these subscribers 4,720 have paid their 5 per cent assessment, making 35,087 paid up shares.  Of these, 31,492 shares were voted Tuesday night, when 538 ballots were cast.</p>

                            <head type="sub">RESULT OF THE RECENT ELECTION</head>
                            <head type="sub">But Forty-Nine of the Many Candidates for the Directory Win&#8212;Scope of the Great Show Discussed.</head>
                            <p>The meeting of the stockholders of the Transmississippi Exposition association, held last Tuesday night for the purpose of electing a board of fifty directors, was convened this morning for the purpose of receiving the report of the canvassing board on the result of the election.  The report was read, showing the number of votes received by each person voted for, the detailed report being given herewith.  The total number of shares of stock voted aggregated 31,942; number of shares, or votes, necessary for election, 15,747.  Forty-nine men only received the number of votes necessary to elect, and they were duly declared by President Wattles, as follows:</p>
                            <p>C. F. Manderson, J. H. Millard, Z. T. Lindsay, T. Kilpatrick, E. E. Bruce, H. A. Thompson, C. M. Wilhelm, Lucian Wells, G. W. Holdrege, E. Rosewater, R. S. Wilcox, J. A. Creighton, W. A. Paxton, sr., W. N. Babcock, John H. Evans, George F. Bidwell, E. Dickinson, A. H. Noyes, Dan Farrell, jr., A. C. Smith, Charles Metz, G. W. Wattles, J. L. Brandies, C. F. Weller, Dudley Smith, I. W. Carpenter, J. E. Markel, T. L. Kimball, F. P. Kirkendall, C. E. Yost, G. M. Hitchcock, Herman Kountze, G. H. Payne, L. H. Korty, J. A. Wakefield, A. L. Reed, J. H. Hussie, E. C. Price, Walter Jardine, C. W. Lyman, C. S. Montgomery, Alvin Saunders, J. J. Brown, John A. Johnson, J. L. Webster, F. B. Hibbard, Dr. E. W. Lee, F. Murphy, J. C. Wharton.</p>
                            <p>The next highest man was W. R. Bennett, but he received only 14,759 votes, almost 1,000 votes less than a majority.  C. S. Montgomery, the legal advisor of the old board, gave it as his off-hand opinion that Mr. Bennett would still be a director until January 1 by virtue of the fact that the old board of directors had been elected to serve until that time and that that fact would make him a member of the new board.  Mr. Montgomery also said that he was of the opinion that the board had the power to fill the vacancy caused by the failure to elect the fiftieth man.</p>
                            <p>Acting upon this opinion the meeting of the stockholders was adjourned sine die and the matter will be discussed at the first meeting of the new board, to be held at the Commercial club rooms at 2 p. m. tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bennett said he was determined not to serve as a director on the new board, for the reason that his business demanded all of his time and attention.  He said he had not given the complication which had arisen any consideration and could not say whether he should resign at once or not, but was firm in his determination to carry out the spirit of his public announcement, although he said he should not do anything that would further complicate matters.</p>
                            <p>Now that the election of directors is settled, the question that naturally arises is the organization of the board.  Several of the directors were seen this morning after the result of the election was declared and all were of the opinion that due deliberation should be given to the question of officers and plan of organization.  There are no candidates in the field for any of the elective offices.  The only approach to a candidacy for any position has been the move of some of the banks toward the election of a treasurer who will place the funds in certain of the depositories.  There are no candidates openly in the field for this position, but some of the banks are quietly pushing men who are favorable to their interests.</p>
                            <p>For the position of president six men have been mentioned, viz:  General C. F. Manderson, ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, Herman Kountze, J. H. Millard, Frank Murphy and the president of the old board, Gurdon W. Wattles.  None of these men are candidates for the position, but all are being pushed more or less vigorously by their friends.  The consensus of opinion among the directors seems to be in favor of the utmost deliberation in choosing the president, and it is very doubtful if any one will be elected to that position at the meeting tomorrow afternoon.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="297" xml:id="TMISB01-297"/>
                            
                            <p>Mr. Wattles gave expression to the thought which seemed to be in the minds of several of the other directors when he said that the president should be a man of wide reputation in order that he might add weight to the exposition.  Mr. Wattles said the exposition was a big movement and was important enough to command the best efforts of the best man in the city.  He suggested General Manderson as a desirable man for the position, on account of his national reputation and his wide experience in public affairs.  Mr. Wattles said he was not a candidate himself and did not desire the position.  His private interests, he said, required his attention and he felt as though he had already sacrificed too much of his time in bringing the affair to its present stage.  In reply to a direct question as to whether he would decline the position if it was tendered him, Mr. Wattles said he was not prepared to say what he should do under the circumstances; that he was ready to make any reasonable sacrifice in order to promote the best interests of the city, but did not anticipate that there would be any difficulty in inducing a man to accept the position who was better known to the country at large.</p>
                            <p>Inquiry among the directors developed the fact that, with the exception of Mr. Wattles, none of them had given the question of the general plan of work any attention.  Mr. Wattles was therefore asked to outline his ideas of the lines along which the work of the exposition should be started.</p>
                            <p>"I believe that an executive committee should be elected, each member of which should be the head of a bureau having in charge one branch of the work.  The number constituting the executive committee and the number of bureaus to be formed would have to be determined by the board.  The executive committee should have charge of the entire work, subject, in all matters, to the full board.  The most important bureau, and the one which I believe should be first organized, is the bureau of publicity and promotion.  Perhaps there should be separate bureaus, one of publicity and one of promotion.  The bureau of publicity should at once prepare and distribute over all the western states, and over all the United States and the world, for that matter, literature explaining the plan and the scope of the exposition.  It would inform the world what has been done and what we intend to do and pursue a vigorous course of education all over the country.</p>
                            <p>"The bureau of promotion should devote its attention to the matter of securing appropriations from the various state legislatures in the transmississippi region.  It should be prepared to lay before these legislatures full information regarding the exposition, and should prepare bills providing for appropriations and have them introduced and passed by the different legislatures.  It should organize in each state, a strong subcommittee to push the work in that state.  The bureau should move on congress in much the same manner and look after legislation in the interest of the exposition all over the country and the world.</p>
                            <p>"Another bureau should be that of exhibits.  This bureau should have charge of securing exhibits, both domestic and foreign.  It should open correspondence with representatives in other states with a view of securing exhibits from those states, and should see that representatives are sent to the other expositions which are being held.</p>
                            <p>"The bureau of buildings and grounds is another important department which should be organized at once to take charge of the matter of preparing the general plans of the grounds after the site shall have been chosen by the full board.  It should also look after the erection of the buildings after the plans for them have been approved by the full board and should have charge of all details in connection with the arrangement of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>"The transportation bureau is another important department and there are a number of others which will suggest themselves.  There is an immense amount of work to be done and few people appreciate the burden that is bound to fall upon the shoulders of those who shall be chosen to manage the affairs of the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Calls for a Statement as to the Character and Standing of the Directors and Solvency of Subscribers.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Congressman Mercer is in receipt today of the following letter from Acting Secretary of Treasury W. E. Curtis, bearing date of November 30, but which had to run the gamut of various departments before reaching Mr. Mercer:</p>
                            <p>Sir: Referring to your communication of 25th inst., you are advised that this office has received a certificate signed by Gurdon W. Wattles and John A. Wakefield, as president and secretary respectively, of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association, relative to the amount of subscriptions, etc., made in aid of the exposition to be held in the city of Omaha, Neb., authorized by act of congress approved June 10, 1896.  This department desires in addition thereto such evidence as would be competent under the laws of the state of Nebraska to establish the fact of the existence of such corporation, the election of its officers and directors, a statement of their names and the offices to which they were elected, etc.  A certificate should be furnished by the proper officer, also, showing the amounts of subscriptions of stock in good faith, contributions, donations and appropriations from all sources and that said subscriptions of stock have been made in good faith by solvent persons and corporations to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of the official so certifying.  Respectfully yours,</p>
                            <ab>W. E. CURTIS, Acting Secretary.</ab>
                            <p>The selection of the directory, embracing as it does names of many of the best known citizens of Omaha, gives excellent satisfaction here, and is regarded as earnest of what may be expected from such a strong and conservative body.  Senator W. V. Allen, who arrived today, said to The Bee correspondent that on Monday he would introduce an amendment of the urgency deficiency bill covering the amount appropriated at the last session, and would continue tacking the amendment to every appropriation bill until favorable action was taken.  "After the amount appropriated by the bill is secured, then it will be time enough to increase the appropriation, if such action is deemed advisable," said Senator Allen.</p>

                            at the election of the new directory for the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  Business men, professional men and laboring men were all there by the hundred, and the man with the one share which was all he could afford, voted it as proudly as did the man with the 3,000 or the 1,000.</p>
                            <p>As an indication of the intense interest shown, there were voted 31,492 shares of the 34,000 in round numbers upon which the first assessment had been paid.  There were two tickets, on which was waged a sharp but friendly rivalry, and the advocates of Miller park or Riverview park, or Elmwood park, or the Belt line district each had candidates on the two tickets for whom they worked with ardor.  The laboring men had three nominees and were out in force urging their claims.  The retailers did some heroic pulling for their share of one of the tickets.  South Omaha had several active campaigners pushing about in the crowd.  Some were there to urge names not on the ballots.  But every man seemed to feel that, though he be defeated in the election, there was a greater victory for every one, himself as well.</p>

                            <p>Of the two tickets, one had been known for several days, while the other was of more recent makeup, and was said to represent the heaviest moneyed interests of the city, and good authorities say that it has been elected by an overwhelming majority.  This is the ticket:</p>
                            <p>G. W. Wattles, J. E. Markel, Dan Farrell, jr., Dudley Smith, W. R. Bennett, I. W. Carpenter, G. H. Payne, H. A. Thompson, Charles Metz, John H. Evans, C. S.

                            <p>The other ticket was the one indorsed by the citizens' mass meeting at the Commercial club rooms Monday evening, and was supposed to represent the interests of the retailers and organized

                            labor as well as the large stockholders.  This was the make-up:</p>
                            <p>G. W. Lininger, Fred M. Youngs, William H. Bell, Fred Schuebel, Henry Hardy, John Hussie, C. M. Wilhelm, A. Hospe, jr., Major R. S. Wilcox, Thomas Kilpatrick, H. A. Thompson, Fred H. Davis, John A. Creighton, E. Rosewater, George H. Payne, G. W. Wattles, Frank Murphy, A. L. Reed, O. C. Holmes, E. A. Cudahy, A. H. Noyes, A. C. Foster, G. M. Hitchcock, J. L.

Weller, J. H. Dumont, Z. T. Lindsey, Walter Jardine, Frank Colpetzer, A. R. Dufrene, Senator C. F. Manderson, J. H. Millard, W. J. Connell, James Walsh, William R. Adams, Lucius Wells, Chris Hartman, J. A. Johnson.</p>
                            <p>As will be observed, these names appeared on both tickets:  G. W. Wattles, Dan Farrell, jr., W. R. Bennett, G. H. Payne, H. A. Thompson, Thomas Kilpatrick, Frank Murphy, Z. T. Lindsey, John A. Johnson, E. Rosewater, G. M. Hitchcock, R. S. Wilcox, A. L. Reed, Walter Jardine, C. F. Manderson, John A. Creighton, J. H. Millard, A. H. Noyes, C. M. Wilhelm, J. H. Hussie, C. F. Weller, Lucius Wells, J. L. Brandeis and Alvin Saunders.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BADLY SCRATCHED.</head>
                            <p>Yet the tickets were scratched unmercifully.  The voters began on the desks before they fell in line, and then continued changing names after they were in line, using the backs of the men ahead of them for writing desks.  And so it comes about that there are on an average of ten or more scratched names on every ballot, and counting results is a long task.</p>
                            <p>At 8 o'clock proceedings began, when the stockholders present were called to order, and on motion G. W. Wattles was elected president and G. A. Wakefield secretary.  Motions were made and carried that the president appoint the necessary officers to proceed with the election of the new directory, and that the election being at once.</p>
                            <p>These were the officers appointed: Judges, J. A. Wakefield, W. F. Holmes and Ben Robideaux; tellers, R. W. Richardson, Ed J. Cornish and C. S. Montgomery; clerks, John Daugherty and W. Farnam Smith.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">FORTY-FIVE MINUTE WALK.</head>
                            <p>Soon the balloting began, the voters forming in the center of the room, the long line, which made a small circle, converging into the line that marched around three sides of the room.  And it meant forty-five minutes' time to get from one end of that line to the ballot box,</p>
                            <p>When each voter arrived at the ballot box, he gave his name, and a clerk certified to the number of shares which he was entitled to vote, after which one of the judges stamped the ballot and placed upon it the number of votes which it represented.  Then it was passed on to another judge and found its way into the box.  In the case of proxies, of which there was an endless number, each proxy was looked up in the same manner as if the bearer were the original holder of the stock, unless the proxies had been previously registered at Secretary Wakefield's office.</p>
                            <p>There were enthusiastic men, such as Walter Jardine and John A. Johnson, who went out and rustled proxies and showed up in the line every few minutes as soon as they had secured them, thus passing in front of the box half a dozen times during the evening.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROTEST FILED.</head>
                            <p>At this juncture Thomas F. Sturgess filed a protest against permitting the acceptance of any votes representing stock that had been subscribed under conditions which would exempt the subscribers from collection by legal process.  This protest was in behalf of organized labor and was designed to head off certain corporations which had been reported as having made threats that no further payments would be made on any stock subscriptions unless certain conditions were fulfilled.</p>
                            <p>For the first two hours the hall was a struggling mass of men through which the long, circuitous line forced its way, and then the majority had voted and soon left for home.  For the next hour there were but few voters, although the election officers were still kept busy.  Then shortly after 11 o'clock, when the theaters were over, three gentlemen came rushing in.  The first was Senator Manderson with the Burlington vote, representing $30,000, and his own personal vote, representing $2,000 more.  Immediately followed Mr. G. M. Hitchcock with his personal vote, representing $2,000, and he was followed by Mr. W. R. Bennett with his own stock and proxies, which represented an amount in four figures.  President Wattles then mounted the platform to put the motion 
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="294" xml:id="TMISB01-294"/> -->
                            
                            to adjourn for the night, when Walter Jardine straggled in, puffing like a steam engine, and offered proxies for eleven shares.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">AN ALL-NIGHT JOB.</head>
                            <p>Then it was moved that the polls be closed, and that the meeting adjourn to 9:30 o'clock this morning.  The motion was carried.  In this connection, it was announced that the counting of the ballots would be an all-night job, which the election officers did not desire to undertake, therefore the postponement until today.</p>
                            <p>During the evening a double set of ballot boxes was arranged so that the counting and voting could proceed at the same time.  After an hour's work the officers found that they had counted fifty ballots and the enormity of their job became hugely apparent.</p>
                            <p>From those that were counted, and from a hasty glance over the others as they were straightened out, the indication pointed to the election of the "official" ticket, or the one indorsed by the old directory, and commonly designated last evening as the "square ticket," owing to its shape, the other being printed on a narrow strip.</p>
                            <p>The results, however, may be affected somewhat by the fact that W. R. Bennett yesterday announced that he had withdrawn from the race, and this furnished capital for the adherents of candidates not on the printed tickets, among them being Captain Palmer and J. Y. Craig.</p>
                            <p>The men who have been at the helm ever since the inauguration of the plans for the exposition were heartily congratulating each other last evening over the interest that had been aroused, as indicated by the fact that 95 per cent of the shares eligible to representation were voted, that the most harmonious feeling prevailed, and that there was every assurance of the Trans-Mississippi exposition being a grand success.</p>
                            <p>The board of directors met this morning and adjourned from time to time during the progress of the count, that the session might be prolonged till the result became known and officially announced.  The count proceeds slowly, and it may be late this afternoon before the end shall be reached.</p>
                            <p>As an indication of how far the use of proxies was carried the 31,492 votes were cast by 538 parties.</p>

                            <head type="sub">South Omaha Snubbed and Insulted.</head>
                            <p>We are still trying to preserve the equilibrity of our temper and to let on as if nothing has ever come up to disturb our amiable and affable <choice><sic>lovliness</sic><corr>loveliness</corr></choice>, but every time we come within a gunshot distance at the thought of how we got the boneset tea poured into us by the silk-underclothed grafters of Omaha on that directorship deal it takes a heroic soporific remedy to quiet us.  After reconsidering the matter we find no reason for mollifying or <choice><sic>apoligizing</sic><corr>apologizing</corr></choice> for the criticism we yesterday made.  It was none <choice><sic>to</sic><corr>too</corr></choice> strong, nor unfair.  South Omaha was snubbed, insulted and robbed by the Omaha brigands, and nothing less.  They came to us and enlisted our best men in the work of getting subscriptions on the ground that the exposition would be a good thing for South Omaha, and that the emoluments would be equitably distributed.  They took our subscriptions and promised several of our citizens that they would be given places on the board of directors and they gave us nothing.  This was obtaining money under false pretenses, and a slap at the city whose heart and purse have always been ready to help her neighbor in 
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="294" xml:id="TMISB01-294"/> -->
                            
                            legitimate projects.  It was also a declaration that Omaha proposes to run the exposition as a private institution for private profit.  That thirty men, lawyers, politicians and plutocrats were to have the show under their thumb and that they, instead of the west as was designed by the convention that selected Omaha for the exposition, and their individual friends are to enjoy the pecuniary and appointive <choice><sic>perequisites</sic><corr>perquisites</corr></choice>.  It is said as an argument against South Omaha's right to kick over the treatment she received that the amount of her subscriptions was simply a drop as compared with the contributions of Omaha,  That is not the idea at all. If the exposition was originally designed as an exclusive Omaha enterprise it would be different.  But the moment she sought outside assistance she relinquished such an idea if she ever entertained it, and if South Omaha had subscribed but one dollar she was morally 
                            
                            <pb/><!-- <pb n="298" xml:id="TMISB01-298"/> -->
                            
                            entitled to a representation on the board.  If it was not intended to give it to her, then Omaha had no right to invoke our assistance.  The truth is as we yesterday stated.  The thirty conspirators did nothing more than skin-game us.  They had it fixed for weeks to put themselves in full control of every particular of the exposition, and they propose to run it identically as they last fall ran the state fair&#8212;as a game of bunko, robbery and cut-throatism.  A South Omaha citizen who contributes any further assistance to the enterprise is a natural-born damn fool&#8212;worse than the country jay who runs up against the "big mit" or shell game.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Forty-Nine Directors Choice, Mr. Bennett Holding Over---Wattles and Wakefield Up for Re-Election.</head>
                            <p>The meeting of the stockholders of the Trans-Mississippi exposition was called to order this morning in the board of trade hall, and official proclamation made of the result of the election for a new board of directors, by which forty-nine men were declared to have received a majority of the votes cast and therefore duly elected.  W. R. Bennett not having received the required majority it was decided that he would hold over as a member of the board until such time as a new election shall be called.</p>
                            <p>The deficiency in the vote cast for Mr. Bennett was due to the card he published the day of the election announcing that he was not a candidate for the directory.  No one doubts that his vote would have been among the highest had not this card appeared in the public prints.</p>
                            <p>The stockholders' meeting adjourned sine die after the announcement of the result of the election.</p>
                            <p>The new directory meets at the Commercial club tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock to organize.</p>
                            <p>Up to the present there does not develop any opposition to the re-election of G. W. Wattles as president of the exposition, if he will accept the place.  Personally he says he is not to be considered in the nature of being a candidate for that position, as he feels that it will make more demands upon him than he can afford to give with his other business affairs.  Still many of the new directors think that if he is tendered the position with anything like unanimity, he will accept it, and that his interest in the exposition and experience already acquired will make him almost indispensable in that place.</p>
                            <p>There seems no doubt that John A. Wakefield as secretary may be chosen to continue in that position.</p>
                            <p>There may be considerable of a contest for the treasurership, as there will be an important cash balance in the hands of that officer during the progress of the exposition, which any of the banks in the city would be glad to handle.</p>
                            <p>An executive board may be elected at the meeting tomorrow, but no one appears to know whether the board will be composed of five, seven or more members, or in what manner they shall be elected.  This is considered the most important division of the labor of the directory, and there is every prospect of a prolonged but friendly contest for these places.</p>
                            <p>One plan generally discussed is to place candidates in nomination for the various executive offices at the first meeting and then adjourn to give time to <choice><sic>crystalize</sic><corr>crystallize</corr></choice> sentiment and investigate qualifications.</p>
                            <p>The result of the canvass of the votes cast in the election of the news directory shows the following directors to have been elected by the vote appended to their names:</p>

                            <p>The following letter from the treasury department explains itself:</p>
                            <p>To Hon. David H. Mercer, House Representatives, City.&#8212;Sir: Referring to your communication of the 25th inst., you are advised that this office has received a certificate signed by Gurdon W. Wattles and John A. Wakefield, as president and secretary, respectively, of Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition association, relative to the amount of subscriptions, etc., made in aid of the exposition to be held at the city of Omaha, Neb., authorized by act of congress, approved June 10, 1896.</p>
                            <p>The department desires, in addition thereto, such evidence as would be competent, under the laws of the state of Nebraska to establish the fact of the existence of such corporation, the election of its officers and directors, a statement of their names, and the offices to which they were elected, etc.</p>
                            <p>A certificate should be furnished by the proper officer, also, showing the amounts of subscriptions of stock, in good faith, contributions, donations and appropriations from all sources and that said subscriptions of stock have been made in good faith by solvent persons and corporations to best of the knowledge, information and belief of the official so certifying.  Respectfully yours,</p>
                            <ab>W. E. CURTIS, <lb/> Acting Secretary.</ab>
                            <p>Representative Mercer says it will be necessary to comply with this request, and urges the friends of the exposition to secure the required authentication as soon as possible, in order that the appropriation may be made available without unnecessary delay.</p>

                            <p>"It is regretted that in the selection of the directors of the transmississippi exposition South Omaha was not accorded representation thereon.  That enterprising town has always been ready to take an active part in any move calculated to build up either Omaha or Nebraska, and her citizens have always answered the call when any Omaha interest was at stake.  Just why, then, South Omaha should have been left out in the matter of selecting directors is not clear. * * *  The first thing to do is lay aside personal feelings and unite in the work of making the exposition a great and magnificent success.

                            <head type="sub">NOTHING BUT PRELIMINARY WORK DONE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Organizations Postponed Until Questions Involved in the Failure to Elect a Full Board Are Solved&#8212;Labor Asks Representation.</head>
                            <p>The first meeting of the newly elected directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association was held at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon.  Of the forty-nine members elected by the stockholders last Tuesday night, forty-three were present, the other members being out of the city.  The meeting was characterized by a disposition to proceed with the greatest caution in order that the success of the exposition might not be jeopardized in the slightest degree by an unwise step.  There was apparent a healthy amount of enthusiasm, which was manifested several times, but there was nothing of an effervescent nature in the sentiment which developed.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was called to order by President G. W. Wattles of the old board of directors, and ex-Governor Alvin Saunders was chosen temporary chairman and John A. Wakefield temporary secretary.</p>
                            <p>The fact that but forty-nine directors had been elected by the stockholders, instead of fifty, as provided in the articles of incorporation, was the first subject for discussion.  The consensus of opinion was to the effect that it was a vital point whether the board could legally organize with less than fifty directors, or whether the forty-nine elected by the stockholders had the power to elect the fiftieth man, or whether Mr. Bennett, by virtue of the fact that he is a member of the old board, would hold over and be a member of the new board of directors.  These phases of the question were debated at great length and the whole matter was finally referred to a committee, consisting of Messrs. C. S. Montgomery, J. C. Wharton and J. L. Webster, to investigate all the questions involved and report to the board at its next meeting.</p>
                            <p>During this discussion a communication was presented from W. R. Bennett, in which he tendered his resignation as a director of the exposition.  This was laid on the table until the report of the committee referred to above is received.  The same action was taken with reference to a communication from organized labor, presented by I. W. Carpenter, one of the directors.  This communication was signed by T. F. Sturgess, president of the Typographical union, and asked that, in case of a vacancy in the board of directors, a representative of organized labor be elected to fill the vacancy.</p>
                            <p>J. C. Wharton called attention of the board to the fact that a great deal of dissatisfaction existed among the members of the labor unions on account of the fact that they had not been given representation on the board of directors, and he introduced a resolution, providing that in case of a vacancy occurring in the board of directors the labor unions of Omaha and South Omaha be requested to select and present to the board of directors the names of three men representing organized labor, and providing, further, that the names so presented should receive the consideration of the board in the election of a director to fill vacancy.  This resolution was unanimously adopted.</p>
                            <p>In view of the complications existing regarding the legal organization of the board on account of the failure to elect a full board of fifty directors, it was decided to postpone the election of officers until the next meeting.</p>
                            <p>E. Rosewater suggested that, in order that the work of the board might be expedited as much as possible, a committee should be appointed to recommend a plan of organization and work and present the same to the board at its next meeting, and he moved the appointment of such a committee.  The idea met with favor and the motion was adopted.  The chair appointed Messrs. E. Rosewater, C. F. Manderson, Frank Murphy, Dudley Smith and G. W. Wattles as such committee.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was adjourned until next Tuesday afternoon at 2 o'clock at the rooms of the Commercial club.</p>

                            <p>The committee on organization appointed at Saturday's meeting of the directors of the Transmississippi Exposition directory met yesterday afternoon.  The necessity of commencing active work at the earliest date possible was so apparent that the committee did not feel as though any time should be wasted in the preliminary work.  Nothing can be accomplished until the organization of the directory is completed and some definite plan of procedure is decided upon.</p>
                            <p>There were present at the meeting Frank Murphy, G. W. Wattles, Dudley Smith and E. Rosewater, all the members of the committee except General Manderson.  Several hours were spent in discussing the various plans of organization which had been proposed, at the conclusion of which one was formulated which will very likely be submitted to the directory when it meets Tuesday.  Only a rough draft was completed yesterday and the committee will meet again this afternoon, when it is hoped all the members can be present, to further consider and reduce it to a proper form for consideration of the directory.</p>
                            <p>While Omaha people are busy formulating plans for actively organizing the exposition the people of other states in the great west are making arrangements to have the resources and advantages of their states suitably represented.  None have been more active than the Californians, as the following from the San Francisco Examiner will show:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CALIFORNIA INTERESTED.</head>
                            <p>"George W. Parsons of Los Angeles is in the city in the interest of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha June 1 to November 1, 1898.  Mr. Parsons is one of the vice presidents to the proposed Exposition, his special mission being to look after the interests of California.</p>
                            <p>"At the last congress of the transmississippi states it was unanimously determined that the most effective means of displaying to the world at large the matchless resources of the west was through the medium of an exposition held at some central point.  Omaha was selected on account of its geographical location, for within a radius of 500 miles of that city over 20,000,000 people are to be found.</p>
                            <p>"'My object in visiting San Francisco and northern California at the present time,' said Mr. Parsons last night, 'is to  arouse the interest of the masses in this great enterprise.  The Exposition will be international in character, though special attention will be given the industries found in the transmississippi states&#8212;twenty-four altogether.  This means that one-half of the wealth of the United States is interested in the success of the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>"'The Exposition is now practically assured.  The capital is fixed at $1,000,000, and one-third of this has already been subscribed by citizens of Omaha.  Congress has passed an act authorizing the exposition and appropriating $200,000 for a government building and exhibit.  The coming congress will be asked to increase the amount to $500,000, and we are assured that the request will be granted.  The state of Iowa at the last session of its legislature made a preliminary appropriation of $10,000, but this sum will be materially increased, assuring them of a splendid representation in the exposition.  Louisiana, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado and other states have pledged their support, and it now remains to see what action California will take.</p>
                            <p>"I find that our citizens generally are greatly interested in the exposition, and the next legislature will be asked to appropriate $75,000.  We must have the fullest representation of products, industries, etc., and nothing short of the sum named will do this.  I am now making a canvass of the state, and may truthfully say that I have not yet found a business man who does not heartily indorse our scheme.  The representative men of all classes, professions and business interests of the transmississippi states are interested in the success of the exposition, because it will unquestionably add to the commercial and material welfare of the region in which they live."</p>
                            <p>"Every state west of the Mississippi will be represented in the directorate of the exposition company by a vice president to be named by the governor.  The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce indorsed Mr. Parsons, and some weeks ago Governor Budd named him as California's representative."</p>
                            <p>A dispatch to the same paper from Los Angeles states that a meeting of the members of the legislature from the southern part of the state has been called to consider proposed legislation, and among other things which will receive consideration will be plane to further the securing of an appropriation for state representation at the Transmississippi Exposition.  It is expected the southern California delegation will be a unit for this measure.</p>

                            <p>West Point Progress: Omaha has elected her board of directors of the Transmississippi Exposition, and every mothers' son of them are among her leading citizens.  Now, let the good work go on.</p>
                            <p>Norfolk Journal:  All Nebraska is interested in the success of the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha, and for that reason the legislature at its approaching session should make a liberal appropriation for a Nebraska exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Cedar Bluffs Standard:  The Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha will be the next great event in America.  It will be second only to the great World's fair, and every Nebraskan should lend his aid to make it a success.</p>
                            <p>Fullerton News:  The Omaha exposition ought to result in much good for Nebraska.  It will be the means of bringing thousands of strangers to the state who will have to leave a little money behind them.  It will also attract capital for investment.  Nebraska has only to be seen to be appreciated.  Boom the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Schuyler Herald: The legislature of this state will be asked to make an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition.  This is a matter in which every citizen of this commonwealth and the great central west is interested.  The exposition means much to us all, and we think that the people will not object to a liberal appropriation being made.</p>

The Burlington is the first railroad to subscribe anything and the liberal sum donated by that company means that <choice><sic>similiar</sic><corr>similar</corr></choice> sums must follow, which will inaugurate a great boom for the coming exposition.</p>

                            <p>The forty-nine directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association met at the Commercial club rooms this afternoon.  The committee of attorneys appointed to consider the method of electing the fiftieth director decided that the board of directors had full power to fill the vacancy.  The report was adopted and a ballot was at once ordered.  The names of Fred M. Youngs, representing the labor interests of Omaha; Tom Hoctor, South Omaha, county commissioner, and W. A. Hart, banker, Council Bluffs, were presented.</p>
                            <p>On the first ballot Fred M. Youngs was elected, receiving twenty-nine of the forty-four votes cast.</p>
                            <p>The committee on organization of the exposition submitted the following report for the organization of the working forces of the great show:</p>

                            <p>The board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition held another meeting at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon and completed its membership by the election of a representative of organized labor to fill the vacant place.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was called to order by President Saunders, and a roll call developed forty-four members present.</p>
                            <p>The law committee reported that the forty-nine directors were legally elected, and that the failure to elect the fiftieth was due to the stockholders.  This made the duty incumbent upon the directors to choose the person for the vacant place.  The committee recommended that the board select the other member before transacting any other business.</p>

A ballot was ordered and resulted in twenty-nine votes for Youngs, four for Hoctor, two for Clarkson and nine for Hart.  Youngs was thereupon declared elected to the vacant place, and he was notified accordingly.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed to prepare a plan of organization made its report, favoring an executive committee of seven, and the division of the exposition work into seven departments, each member of the committee to be the head of a department.

                            <p>Mr. Montgomery moved that the board proceed to the election of officers, and it prevailed, with but one opposing vote.</p>
                            <p>Later Mr. Rosewater moved that a committee of five be appointed to select names of those who would serve on the executive committee and report at a subsequent meeting.  This was taken by some to mean the selection of names for all the offices, and after some discussion the board rescinded its former action looking to an immediate election, and accepted an amendment to Rosewater's motion that a committee of seven should be appointed instead of five, and that it should select names of men for all the offices who were willing to stand as candidates.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Board of Managers Necessary to the Success of the Tremendous Enterprise&#8212;Spicy Interviews.</head>
                            <p>"Are we to be given any part in the exposition management?"</p>
                            <p>This is the question that is being anxiously asked by the women of the state.  In Omaha they are making this inquiry at club meetings and afternoon teas, and from all parts of Nebraska letters are coming with the conundrum inclosed.</p>
                            <p>"It seems very strange that we have not even been mentioned," remarked a woman prominent in the social and literary life of the city.  "We hear a lot about what the directors are going to do, but not a word is said concerning the part that should be taken by women.  Of course, the men will probably let us help when they find they cannot get along without us, but we do not want such tardy recognition.  A woman's board should be formed immediately.  We think that there should be women appointed from all parts of Nebraska, and the woman's board should have auxiliaries in all the other states.  The World's fair demonstrated what help women could be, and the Trans-Mississippi exposition cannot afford to be independent of the assistance of the thousands of Nebraska women who are ready to give enthusiastic labor for what is really a great enterprise."</p>
                            <p>If Mr. Wattles or Mr. Wakefield could have heard this declaration of equal rights, there would doubtless be a meeting called for the express purpose of making the amende honorable for what is considered an almost unpardonable neglect.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wakefield, secretary of the exposition, was asked if any effort had yet been made to assure the co-operation of women.  He shook his head, and hinted that there had been so many perplexing exposition questions that this particular one had been lost beyond the reach of present discussion.</p>
                            <p>"Of course we have vaguely contemplated assistance of women in the preparation for the big fair," he said, "but we have not yet got round to any action.  We realize that success could not be assured without the help of women and we shall by and by give them a foremost place.  So far, we have been busy seeing whether we could have an exposition.  The money problem has been the <choice><sic>cheif</sic><corr>chief</corr></choice> one to confront us.  Now that we have the exposition assured beyond peradventure, we can discuss details.  The first thing to do is to complete organization and arrange the departments of work.  After that the right thing will be done so far as arranging for the co-operation of women is concerned."</p>
                            <p>"Have you ever discussed the place you will give to the women?" was asked.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wakefield looked as if he felt really embarrassed.  If he had been politic and a man who evidently knows how to propitiate the most insistent feminine helpers he would have said, "No."  As it was, he smiled and dodged the question by repeating that the directors had not, he was sure, ever lost sight of the importance of appealing to women for their co-operation.</p>
                            <p>"There seems to be a general misunderstanding about the present board of directors," said President Wattles when asked about what was planned for the women.  "The man on the board have been doing the financiering.  For that purpose it was necessary to choose men of wide business experience.  It was not so important that the various professions and mercantile activities&#8212;the different public interests in fact&#8212;should be represented as it was to find men capable of successfully managing a difficult enterprise.  As soon as the work of the exposition proper is begun, there will be departments or bureaus organized.  In all these women will be called to take a principal part.  In fact they will be relied upon for much of the most important work.  They will have a place on all the leading committees and there will be no chance for any one to feel neglected.  We want ever one <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Carlisle May Act in the Matter.</head>
                            <p>If Secretary Carlisle is next to his job, and the history of his secretaryship shows that he invariably is, the grafters of the transmississippi directorship are likely to meet with a dangerous maelstrom before they can traverse the ocean they embarked upon when they fixed matters so that none but their favorites could hold membership in the directory.  Uncle Sam is very particular in having his laws fulfilled to the letter, and when he subscribed $300,000 to the transmississippi congress he didn't do it for the purpose of feeding a lot of gilt-edged grafters, but to have the provisions and restrictions which he sent with his donation strictly complied with.  In the most vital particular this has not been done.  One of the bona fide, essential provisions of the government donation was that it was not to go unless the people hereabouts legitimately subscribed three hundred thousand.  People with white-washed memories will remember that the task of raising the $300,000 was a hummer.  They will also remember that when the final blow was struck and the announcement was made that the sum had been raised, that it was the subscription of the B. &amp; M. and Herman Kountz which did the biz.  They will not remember, because they did not notice it, that the magnificent generosity of the B. &amp; M. and Herman Kountz had a great big tow line tied to it.  This tow line consisted of a provision.  This provision was to the effect that each did not know whether he, she or it wanted to subscribe or donate the sum set opposite their names, and that they reserved the right to decide within a certain length of time.  So far as known they did not decided at the time of the election, nor have they since.  Therefore their "subscription" was null and without effect.  Now to become a voter in the affairs of the transmississippi congress one <choice><sic>muct</sic><corr>must</corr></choice> be a subscriber, an owner of stock.  You can be as lavish as you wish in your gift to the grafters, but you cannot vote.  "Donations" count for nothing, except as so much rake-off in the pockets of the boodlers.  The B. &amp; M. voted its ostensibly thirty thousand shares; Herman Kountz voted his.  These votes were illegal, but they decided the election, and were cast for the benefit of the grafters.  South Omaha put up good money to be <choice><sic>flimflamed</sic><corr>flimflammed</corr></choice> by a bluff that was backed by nothing.  Secretary Carlisle is a business man, and when he learns that Herman Kountz and the B. &amp; M. voted in the election without any authority whatever he will be very apt to decide that Omaha has not lived up to the requirements of the transmississippi bill and that the election was a fraud.  The B. &amp; M. and Kountz may now come in and say they "subscribed;" that will cut no figure.  They had not at the time and their votes were illegal.  Another feature of the trouble is this:  Neither the B. &amp; M. nor Kountz can be held responsible for their supposed subscriptions.  They can at any time say they did not subscribe and leave the congress in the hole for the amount they were supposed to have taken.</p>

                            <p>Exeter Democrat:  We hope the next legislature will have the interest of the state enough at heart to make a liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>Creighton News:  Omaha has elected a new board of directors which is to proceed toward making the Transmississippi congress a success.  To properly manage an exposition of this kind will take a great deal of time and talent to make it a grand success.</p>
                            <p>Tobias Gazette:  The Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha ought to be of great benefit to that city and the state as a whole.  It will be the means of bringing many to the state who have never seen it, and once to see the state with its fertile fields will change the opinion of those who have formed an opinion that Nebraska is a desert.</p>
                            <p>Grand Island Independent:  About the biggest piece of nonsense seen in print for a long while is the alleged fear that the western mining states will not participate in the Transmississippi Exposition because that exposition takes place in Omaha and Omaha has an editor whose views are against silver monometallism and he isn't afraid to say so at any stage of the game.</p>
                            <p>Schuyler Herald: We are pleased to notice a disposition on the part of the leading newspapers of the state to use their influence toward securing a liberal appropriation at the hands of the Nebraska legislature for the Transmississippi Exposition.  No false idea of economy should prevent a substantial appropriation.  It will be money well expended.  The exposition means more to this state and the great central west than many suppose.  Its benefits cannot be overestimated.  It will be the means of bringing thousands upon thousands of strangers within our borders, and will advertise the many great natural advantages of the transmississippi country.  Every citizen of Nebraska should add his mite toward making it the grandest success of the age.</p>
                            <p>Chappell Register: The Denver papers now threaten Omaha that if The Bee does not stop poking fun and picking on Billy Bryan they will "boycott" the Transmississippi Exposition.  That kind of talk is silly and childish.  The Exposition will be of as much benefit to Colorado as to Nebraska, and if Colorado can stand a boycott of this kind Omaha certainly can.  But, as it is not Colorado that is making these silly threats, only a few over-zealous supporters of Bryan, the threat will fall flat.  The idea that a paper must not criticise a public man is silly, and a paper or a person who would retaliate by "boycotting" an enterprise that the whole country is interested in has simply entered its second childhood.  Colorado cannot afford to be left out of this exposition.  When the time comes they will be in it clear up to the neck, the Denver papers to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

                            <p>Twenty-five members of the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition answered the roll call at the meeting yesterday afternoon when ex-Senator Saunders had rapped for order.</p>
                            <p>While Secretary Wakefield read the minutes of the last meeting most of the twenty-five belated members made their appearance.</p>
                            <p>The following resolution was then offered by Mr. Wattles, and unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>"Resolved, That the selection of the site fore location of the exposition and the appointment of all committees, officers and agents to investigate proposed sites, shall be made by the full board of directors, and that these questions shall not be settled, nor any powers delegated by the board of directors, except by majority vote at a meeting regularly called for that purpose."</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">NO OFFICER TO ACCEPT PAY.</head>
                            <p>Mr. J. C. Wharton offered a resolution providing that no director or officer should accept any compensation for services rendered.  The question whether the secretary was to be included in this resolution caused some discussion, but the resolution was unanimously adopted.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater, as chairman of the committee appointed to prepare a list of persons able to serve as officers, presented his report, as follows:</p>
                            <p>Mr. Chairman&#8212;Your committee, appointed to submit for the consideration of this board a list of names of persons qualified to serve as officers of the Exposition association and members of the executive committee, has endeavored to perform its duty to the best of its ability.  The list herewith submitted contains the names of all persons recommended or indorsed by two or more directors and whom we found willing to accept.  It is to be regretted that a number of the gentlemen whose names had been indorsed positively declined to serve, by reason of their inability to devote the requisite time to the discharge of the duties that would devolve upon them or through disinclination to assume the responsibility.  In submitting these names your committee would recommend that each of the department heads of the executive committee be elected separately.'</p>
                            <p>The names reported were these:</p>
                            <p>President&#8212;G. W. Wattles.</p>
                            <p>Vice president &#8212; Alvin Saunders, Thomas L. Kimball, J. E. Markell or T. S. Clarkson.</p>

                            <p>C. S. Montgomery moved that the meeting should proceed to ballot.  Z. T. Lindsey made a speech supporting Mr. Wattles for president.</p>
                            <p>C. W. Lyman was appointed judge and Messrs. Wilhelm and Thompson, tellers.  Mr. Lyman announced that forty-four votes were cast, Mr. G. W. Wattles receiving forty-two, Mr. Kilpatrick one and Mr. G. W. Lininger one.  On motion of Mr. Kilpatrick the vote was made unanimous.</p>
                            <p>Alvin Saunders, T. L. Kimball, J. E. Markel and T. S. Clarkson were next voted on for the office of vice president, J. H. Hussil and F. M. Youngs acting as tellers.  The first ballot resulted as follows:  Markel, 14; Saunders, 20; Kimball, 7, and Clarkson, 2.  No one having a majority of the forty-three ballots cast, a second vote was taken.</p>
                            <p>The second ballot resulted:  Markel, 20; Saunders, 22; Kimball, 1.  The election of ex-Senator Saunders was made unanimous.</p>

                            <p>John A. Wakefield was unanimously elected secretary.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Yost announced that, if it were definitely known that Mr. Kountze would serve as treasurer if elected, he desired to withdraw.  He then moved that the secretary be instructed to cast the forty-three ballots for Mr. Kountze for treasurer.  Mr. Kountze was, therefore, unanimously elected.</p>
                            <p>It was moved and seconded that the secretary be instructed to cast the entire vote of the directors for Z. T. Lindsey for chief of the department of ways and means.  Mr. Lindsey was therefore elected.</p>

                            <p>The election of the head of the department of publicity followed, G. M. Hitchcock and E. Rosewater being the candidates.</p>
                            <p>The first ballot stood: E. Rosewater, 21; G. M. Hitchcock, 14; D. Smith, 1; G. H. Payne, 6; C. E. Yost,2.</p>
                            <p>Before the second ballot Mr. Hitchcock withdrew his name in favor of C. E. Yost, stating that it seemed, owing to the nature of the position, fairer that it should be in the hands of someone independent of the newspapers.  Mr. Yost had had newspaper experience and was eminently fitted for the position.  Mr. Yost refused to be a candidate.  The result of the second ballot was as follows: Yost, 3; Hitchcock, 8; Rosewater, 24; Payne, 6; Smith, 2.  Mr. Hitchcock moved that the election of Mr. Rosewater be made unanimous.</p>
                            <p>It was moved and seconded that a unanimous vote be cast for F. P. Kirkendall, the only candidate for chief of the department of buildings and grounds.</p>
                            <p>W. N. Babcock was in the same way elected chief of the department of transportation.</p>
                            <p>The election of chief of the department of exhibits resulted in Bruce 29, Smith 14 and Farrell 1.</p>
                            <p>The secretary was instructed to cast a unanimous vote for A. L. Reed as chief of the department of concessions.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Weller, who was slated as chief of the department of promotion, and Mr. Montgomery nominated Mr. Hitchcock.  The secretary was instructed to cast the unanimous vote for G. M. Hitchcock as chief of the bureau of promotion.</p>
                            <p>A. L. Reed, W. H. Roberson, F. M. Youngs, John A. Wakefield and Dudley Smith, the committee to which was referred the examination and auditing of the list of subscriptions to the capital stock, reported that they found the total amount to be $404,720; that a 5 per cent assessment would amount to $20,236, and that of this assessment $18,174.50 had been paid on call of the secretary, while the small subscribers are still making payments.  In their opinion, 90 per cent of the amounts subscribed will be collectible under the proposed plan of assessment.</p>

                            <p>The secretary announced that the governor of Oregon notified the board of directors that he had appointed B. S. Cook of Salem, Ore., as vice president of that state.</p>
                            <p>C. S. Montgomery moved that the bylaws and a revised copy of them be submitted to the executive committee at its next meeting.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bruce moved that a vote of thanks be tendered the retiring board.</p>
                            <p>The following resolution was presented and adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the secretary is hereby authorized to receive sealed propositions for the use of suitable rooms for officers' use and directors' meetings from January 1, 1897, until January 1, 1899; that said propositions be received until Tuesday noon, December 15, 1896, and shall be opened and read to this board at their next regular meeting thereafter.</p>
                            <p>After some discussion, the following resolution was also unanimously adopted:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>

                            <p>Resolved, That the Secretary is hereby authorized to receive sealed propositions for the location of the exposition until Saturday noon, December 26, 1896, and shall open and read said propositions to this board of directors at a meeting which shall be held at 2 o'clock p. m. on Saturday, January 9, 1897.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That said propositions shall specify;</p>
                            <p>First, the number of acres of land offered (which should not be less than 160), and the boundaries thereof;</p>
                            <p>Second, the use of what streets, roads and private ways approaching said land which will be open for public use during the construction and operation of the exposition;</p>
                            <p>Third, all other inducements, including donations or subscriptions of stock which may be offered.</p>
                            <p>In connection with this resolution, General Manderson made an address advocating consultation with the best engineer before a site for the exposition is chosen.</p>

                            <p>Ex-Senator Saunders then introduced President Wattles, who made a short speech.  He said in part:</p>
                            <p>"If I consulted my personal interest, I would decline this position.  It involves great sacrifice, but there are times when the public demands sacrifices and I therefore accept.  I believe in the exposition and feel that it will assist this community out of the slough of despond.  It also means much for the country west of us.  A wrong impression concerning this state and the west has gone abroad, and it must be corrected.  If, in 1898, we gather a fair representation of the resources of this state and its neighbors, we shall revive lagging industries and invite capital and immigration.  I realize that unless this exposition meets with the approval of the best business interests in the city it must be a failure.  It cannot be a one man affair.</p>
                            <p>"Believing that our exposition will be greater than the one at Atlanta or the one in San Francisco I shall accept the position to which I have just been elected and shall devote as much time as possible to forwarding the great enterprise.  I have never thought it necessary to make a failure in business in order to be popular.  I don't expect a failure in connection with this exposition."</p>

                            <p>The executive committee held a meeting immediately after the adjournment of the directors.  Z. T. Lindsey was elected chairman, on motion of Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>The chief business of the meeting was the reading and approval of suggestions made by Secretary Carlisle and Congressman Mercer regarding the bill for an appropriation and it was decided to have a bill drafted embodying the amendments on the line indicated by Secretary Carlisle.</p>
                            <p>The officers were instructed to forward to the treasury department the certificate regarding stock subscription.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Bruce, Reed and Hitchcock were appointed a committee to draft a set of rules for the government of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>It was moved and carried that each head of a department should formulate the needs of his department and report at the next meeting, to be held at 12:30 p. m. Saturday.</p>

                            <p>The Black Hills Irrigation association will hold its third annual meeting at Sturgis City, December 29 and 30, and the secretary has written to the officers of the Trans-Mississippi exposition asking that they have representatives at the meeting.  It is claimed that a majority of the members of the legislature from that section of South Dakota will be present at this meeting, and that it will be advisable for the exposition officers to make their acquaintance.  Ex-Senator Manderson and Governor Holcomb have been invited to make addresses at the meeting, and it has been suggested that a special train be secured and a party of exposition friends go to Sturgis City.</p>

A most important meeting was held at the Commercial Club rooms yesterday afternoon, and an immense amount of business was transacted.  Forty-four of the fifty directors were present, and the meeting was full of interest from the fall of Chairman Saunders' gavel at 2:30 o'clock until the adjournment of the executive committee at 5 o'clock.  The officers and executive committee were elected, and the multitude of matters demanding the immediate attention of the board were taken up and disposed of in an expeditious manner.  Proposals for permanent quarters for the officers and several bureaus were invited, as were also proposals for suitable sites for locating the exposition.  The meeting was most harmonious, and little time was taken up in useless discussion.</p>
                            <p>John C. Wharton introduced a resolution providing that no director of the association who should be elected as an officer or member of the executive committee should receive any remuneration for services rendered the corporation in any capacity.  In the discussion which followed the reading of the resolution it was stated by the introducer that the intent of the resolution was to prohibit any director from occupying any remunerative position under the directory, and if any director was elected to a position to which a salary would naturally attach he would have the alternative of serving without pay or resigning as a director.  The resolution was unanimously adopted.</p>
                            <p>The following resolution was offered by G. W. Wattles and unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the selection of the site for the location of the exposition and the appointment of all committees, offices and agents to investigate sites shall be made by the full board of directors, and that these questions shall not be settled, nor any powers delegated by the Board of Directors, except by majority vote at a meeting regularly called for that purpose.</p>
                            <p>The election followed and resulted in the selection of the parties whose names appear at the head of this column.</p>

                            <p>The following resolution was introduced by C. S. Montgomery and adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the secretary is hereby authorized to receive sealed propositions for the use of suitable rooms for officers' use and directors' meetings from January 1, 1897, until January 1, 1899; that said propositions be received until Saturday noon, December 26, 1896, and shall be opened and read to this board at their next regular meeting thereafter.</p>
                            <p>This resolution was then introduced by Mr. Montgomery:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the secretary is hereby authorized to receive sealed propositions for the location of the exposition until Saturday noon, January 9, 1897, and shall open and read said propositions to this board of directors at a meeting which shall be held at 2 o'clock p. m., on Saturday, January 9, 1897.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That said propositions shall specify:</p>
                            <p>1. The number of acres of land offered (which should not be less than 160) and the boundaries thereof.</p>
                            <p>2. The use of streets, roads and private ways approaching said land will be available for public use during the construction and operation of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>3. All other inducements, including donations or subscriptions of stock, which may be offered.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson advised consulting with expert engineers of wide experience in exposition matters, and thought the question of site should be very carefully considered.  A general discussion followed, after which the resolution was adopted.</p>
                            <p>On motion of E. Rosewater the appointment of vice presidents from the various states were ratified by the board and their selection declared in legal form.</p>
                            <p>The governor of Oregon notified the board that he had appointed B. S. Cook of Salem, Ore., as vice president for that state.  The appointment was endorsed by the board.</p>

                            <p>The committee appointed to report on the amount of subscriptions by solvent persons or corporations reported that it had examined the subscription lists and found the total amounted to $404,720; that a 5 per cent assessment would amount to $20,236, on which $18,174.50 has been paid on the first call, and payments are still being made by small subscribers.  The committee reported that it had found no false subscriptions, and no large subscriptions of doubtful character.  In the opinion of the committee 90 per cent of the amount subscribed will be collected under the plan of assessment proposed, extending over eighteen months.</p>
                            <p>The report was received and ordered made the basis of the report asked for by the Treasury department.</p>
                            <p>A committee on by-laws was instructed to amend the by-laws of the association to comply with the new conditions.</p>
                            <p>A vote of thanks was extended to the old board of directors and Chairman Saunders introduced the new president of the association, G. W. Wattles.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles made a vigorous and concise speech on the importance of the enterprise under consideration.  He predicted that the whole western country would derive immense benefit from the exposition, and made many suggestions based on his experience and knowledge gained in the preliminary work.  He promised to use his best efforts in furthering the cause of the exposition and closed by predicting the success of the movement.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of Mr. Wattles' remarks the meeting adjourned subject to the call of the president.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee held a session immediately after the adjournment of the board.</p>
                            <p>On motion of E. Rosewater, Z. T. Lindsey was elected chairman of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>A letter from Congressman Mercer was presented, which brought up the matter of the suggestions made by Secretary Carlisle as published in the Washington dispatches a few days ago.  Mr. Mercer suggested amending the bill now pending in congress on the lines indicated by the secretary.  The matter was discussed in detail and it was decided to draft a bill, incorporating the suggestions of Mr. Mercer and complying, substantially, with the recommendations of Secretary Carlisle.</p>
                            <p>The officers were instructed to at once furnish the Treasury department with the certificate asked for regarding the stock subscriptions and the solvency of the subscribers.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock, A. L. Reed and E. E. Bruce were appointed to draft a set of rules for the government of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>The heads of departments were instructed to report to the committee at the next meeting the needs of each department.</p>
                            <p>The committee adjourned until 12:30 p. m. Saturday.</p>

                            <head type="sub">From Now on the Heads of the Departments Will Push the Work of the Great Show of 1898.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The various heads of departments of the Transmississippi Exposition association are busy formulating plans for the organization of their departments in order to make comprehensive reports to the executive committee at its meeting on Saturday of this week.  There is a demand on the part of most of them for literature issued by the management of other expositions.  While there is a certain crudity about the ideas of some of the chiefs, there is an evident determination which augurs well for the result of their preliminary maneuvers to familiarize themselves with the work to be done by their departments.</p>
                            <p>The departments which must be put in full working order at the earliest possible moment are those of publicity and promotion.  Upon the department of publicity will develop the work of bringing to the attention of every resident of the transmississippi region the plan and scope of the exposition and the benefit to be derived from it by the entire western portion of the country.  This department is in charge of E. Rosewater.  Mr. Rosewater said this morning that he should recommend to the executive committee at its meeting Saturday that his department be authorized to at once commence the preliminary work of corresponding with the newspapers and prominent people of the western states for the purpose of spreading information regarding the exposition.  For this purpose a bureau of correspondence will have to be established to prepare reading matter to be furnished the western papers for publication and to devise other means of awakening the public to the importance of the exposition and the advisability of the whole western section being well represented.  This work will have to be followed up in a similar manner with respect to the eastern states and foreign governments.  In addition to this Mr. Rosewater said a bureau of advertising would be necessary when the work had advanced somewhat, in order that no stone be left unturned in the effort to bring the exposition prominently before the whole world.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">MUCH OUTSIDE WORK.</head>
                            <p>While work is being done by the department of publicity, the department of promotion will be laying before the legislatures and state officers in the transmississippi states the work of the exposition and taking such steps as may be necessary to have all of those states represented in the great fair.  This department is in charge of G. M. Hitchcock.  Mr. Hitchcock said this morning that he should recommend that he be authorized to at once secure a complete list of all state officers and members of legislatures in the western states and supply them with data and information regarding the plan and scope of the exposition and might be necessary to secure the active co-operation of those states.  As all of the legislatures in these states will meet within the next ninety days, Mr. Hitchcock said he would be compelled to act with the greatest expedition and would devote his energies in that direction first, to be followed by such action in other directions as developments may indicate.</p>
                            <p>The heads of the other departments feel that they have more time to give to "learning the ropes," but are losing no time in getting their work started.  F. P. Kirkendall, chief of the department of buildings and grounds, intends taking a trip to Chicago very soon for the purpose of making a personal investigation into the methods employed at the World's fair.  Z. T. Lindsey, chairman of the executive committee and chief of the department of ways and means, is investigating the methods pursued in the management of others expositions and outlining a plan of operation for the consideration of the executive committee.  E. E. Bruce, chief of the department of exhibits, was out of the city this morning, but it is understood from a reliable source that he is considering the idea of establishing a bureau of agriculture at once for the purpose of making the agricultural feature of the exposition a very strong one.  A. L. Reed, chief of the department of concessions, has already received proposals for some of the minor privileges.  Several jocose tenders for peanut privileges have been received, but as samples were not attached for approval they were not considered.  One tender for the privilege of operating a cigar stand has been submitted in good faith and will be considered in due time.  Mr. Reed is negotiating with several linguists with a view of sending a delegation to Dahomey to secure specialties for the Midway.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles and Secretary Wakefield have been busy today preparing the certificates to be transmitted to the Treasury department in accordance with the letter of Acting Secretary Curtis to Congressman Mercer.  The certificate of the state authorities, showing that the exposition association is legally organized under the laws of the state, has been secured and will be transmitted with the other papers.  The report made to the Board of Directors yesterday by the committee which examined the stock subscription list will be made the basis of the certificate.  An effort will be made to mail all the required documents this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Applications for positions under the several departments have been pouring in upon all the chiefs of departments this morning.  A large number of written applications for various positions has been reposing in the desk of the secretary from the very inception of the exposition project and these will be referred to the proper departments.  In addition to these a very large number of people have just been convinced that the exposition is a "go" and they are climbing into the band wagon in order to secure good berths before the opportunity is lost forever.  Written applications almost without number have been filed with the chiefs of departments, most of them being backed up by personal applications and the solicitations of friends.  Several of the chiefs of departments have expressed a desire to get into permanent headquarters as soon as possible in order that this army of applicants may be seen there and prevent the neglect of business which follows by having to consider their claims during business hours.</p>

                            <p>John A. Wakefield, secretary of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, has decided to resign as a member of the directory.  At the last meeting of the directors a resolution was passed to the effect that no member of the board should draw a salary for services rendered.  This did not mean that the secretary should not be paid for his work, but a rule of that kind was necessary, and as no exception could be made for this one office, it had to be made general, and Mr. Wakefield will therefore resign as director, but continue as secretary, with a suitable salary which the board will readily provide for the place.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wakefield says his resignation will be turned in at the next meeting of the directors, which will probably be held some time between Christmas and New Years, when the board shall be called together to decide upon quarters for the executive committee.  The vacancy will be filled by the board following the precedent established by the Bennett vacancy, and it is possible that a man from South Omaha will be chosen.</p>

It was 8:30 o'clock before the guests sat down to the tables, which were decorated with smilax and roses and potted plants and palms.</p>
                            <p>After cigars had been passed, Rev. S. Wright Butler, as toastmaster, opened the literary part of the program in a style peculiarly his own, and which he maintained throughout the evening in the introduction of every speaker.  The first speaker of the evening was C. F. Weller.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Weller began his address of welcome by complimenting Governor Holcomb upon being one of the best governors the state ever had, which sentiment was greeted with applause.  The club was non-partisan, there being members of all parties in its roll, except, possibly the prohibitionists.  The motto of the club at all times is to stand up for Omaha and the state of Nebraska.</p>

                            <p>Governor Holcomb was introduced to respond to the toast, "Our Commonwealth," and received a rousing reception.  He thought a good purpose was served in the people and the officers of the state getting together occasionally to talk over public matters and becoming better acquainted.</p>
                            <p>On this subject he referred to the union depot which the city was going to have, and hoped that before the millennium came there would be a depot worthy of the city, in which all the railroads would enter.</p>
                            <p>He spoke of the Trans-Mississippi exposition in an enthusiastic manner which met with a hearty response from those present.</p>
                            <p>"If," said he, "We would stand up for Nebraska, work for it and fight for it, it would soon become one of the wealthiest states in the union."  He said Nebraska stood second in the union in amount of corn raised.  He closed by referring to state matters in a non-partisan manner.</p>
                            <p>W. F. Porter, the incoming secretary of state, responded to the toast, "The Duties and Privileges of an American citizen."  He said he felt there was too much of a feeling on the part of business men in the cities that their interests were not identical with that of the farmers, but he thought more meetings like this one would do much toward dissipating that feeling.  He thought the privileges and duties of an American citizen to be co-extension, and all people, civilians and officers, should unite to give the best government possible.  If this is done the officers will try and make the next two years' administration the best in the history of the state.</p>

                            <p>C. J. Smyth, the new attorney general, spoke on the subject, "Can the People Be Trusted?"  In reference to his toast he said the people could be trusted, and as evidence pointed to his own election.  Republicans should not be trusted with democratic secrets and democrats should not be trusted with republican campaign funds.</p>
                            <p>He was not a defender of populism.  If that needed defense it had it best represented in the governor of the state.  Populism was founded on radicalism by radicals, but every great movement in the history of the world was begun by radicals.  The radical men have passed out of control of the populist party or become more moderate, and the organization is led by the Allens and Holcombs.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smyth closed with a beautiful tribute to Nebraska and its future.</p>
                            <p>"The Unpublished Part" was the subject of the address by G. M. Hitchcock.  He said he entered the newspaper business about eleven years ago, and he found that it was as difficult to tell what not to publish as it was to decide what to publish.  He felt that the drud<unclear reason="torn"/> the business was the party who wa<unclear reason="torn"/> something kept out of the paper<unclear reason="torn"/> the theory that it was no news. <unclear reason="torn"/> newspaper man was met every day <unclear reason="torn"/> the problem of what to keep out o<unclear reason="torn"/>paper.  The individual who picks up <unclear reason="torn"/>paper sees at once the things w<unclear reason="torn"/> ought not to have been printed, but <unclear reason="torn"/> individuals commend the good the<unclear reason="torn"/> in the paper.</p>
                            <p>As a rule in American journalism<unclear reason="torn"/>lishers strive to keep from their p<unclear reason="torn"/> the scandals which become to som<unclear reason="torn"/>tent public.  It is a credit to these papers that they are bringing into prominence the greater and more important ma<unclear reason="torn"/> of the world.</p>

                            <p>"Agriculture, the Foundation of Civilization," was responded to by J. <unclear reason="torn"/> Wolfe, the new commissioner of public lands and buildings.  He said he had been acquainted with the city of Omaha to some extent, but never before realized what the attractions of the Commercial club were.  Agriculture was not only the foundation of civilization, but of everything, including wealth and prosperity.  People of Nebraska do not realize that the prosperity of our cities, towns and individuals rests on agriculture.  <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">No Chance for Mismanagement.</head>
                            <p>Having aired its mind to its entire satisfaction on the way South Omaha was treated in that directorship deal by the transmississippi people, the TRIBUNE is now ready to slide off its perch and say a few good words in behalf of those whom the directors selected to take charge of the great enterprise.  Some may say we are doing it in order to seduce the directors to take a favorable squint at Riverview park as a site for the big show, but that's none of their funeral, though it may be if the park is selected,  To begin with, the TRIBUNE will ejaculate that if the transmississippi congress is not "an all-fired success" it will not be due to any flaws in the make-up of its officers.  It would take us several years to select a more able, energetic, persevering set of men to manage the exposition than the one elected on Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>Guerdon W. Wattles, the president, is not only a solid, successful business man, but a town builder without the wind accompaniment.  It was only a few years ago at Carroll, Iowa, that he gave up school teaching to toy with bank checks and the science of money.  He soon developed a capacity and an ability for keen, legitimate business that won him the confidence of heavy eastern capitalists and brought him practically an unlimited supply of financial backing.  Never adventurous, always conservative, yet progressive, he established one of the most <choice><sic>suecessful</sic><corr>successful</corr></choice> banking institutions in the west, organized improvement companies that brought scores of permanent and profitable industries to Carroll, brought that city out of obscurity and placed it among the metropolitan stars of the state.  His mind and bank account were always ready to encourage every legitimate scheme for the advancement of the city, and no one went to him with any kind of a project but what he always considered and helped it if he believed it to possess any merit.  His talents demanding a broader field he came to Omaha about four years ago and his selection as president of the transmississippi congress, the birth of which enterprise was in his fertile brain, evinces that the people of that city were not at all slow in realizing that in him is one who will lead the movement toward restoring us to our old time business liveliness and putting us on a more solid, progressive commercial foundation.  He is a most agreeable gentleman, accessible and courteous. and sociable.</p>
                            <p>John A. Wakefield, the secretary, is known to all of us.  He is an admirable aid for Wattles.  He knows the situation like a book; he is experienced in secretarial pursuits; he is untiring in his labors; he is an Omaha man to the core; he is reliable, and a pusher and a boomer who never flunks.  He has worked hard to see the exposition project assume a tangible shape, and he will work harder to see that his part in its management is a splendid success.</p>
                            <p>Our old friend Rosewater as chairman of the bureau of publicity can hardly be improved upon.  His great success as a journalist, his keen elastic, original mind, and his wonderful energy will enable him to do ample justice to his duties.</p>
                            <p>Hitchcock will also be a success as chairman of the bureau on promotion.</p>
                            <p>He has long since proven himself to be the peer of the Omaha rustlers and patriots, and won the friendship of all by the deep intelligent interest he takes in everything that will increase the standing and prosperity of the west.</p>
                            <p>The directors made a particularly felicitous selection when they elected W. N. Babcock, the able manager of the Union Stock Yards company as chairman of the bureau of transportation.  There is hardly a better informed man in the transmississippi valley on railroad matters than Mr. Babcock, and his long acquaintance with them as well as with railroad officials will enable him to accomplish an inestimable amount of good for the exposition, far more than anyone who has enjoyed none of his experience.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition held a meeting at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon for the purpose of discussing the requirements of the several departments.  All of the members of the committee were present, together with President Wattles and Secretary Wakefield.</p>
                            <p>The secretary reported that the certificate asked for by the Treasury department had been prepared and forwarded to Washington.</p>
                            <p>An application from ex-Governor Furnas for appointment to the position of director general was read and laid on the table for future consideration.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed at the last meeting to prepare by-laws for the association presented a number of by-laws prescribing the powers and duties of the officers.  These were approved by the committee and will be presented to the board of directors at the next meeting.</p>
                            <p>The same committee also reported a set of rules for the government of the executive committee.  These prescribed the order of business, and provided that the head of each of the departments shall be designated as "manager."  The rules also provided that the approval of the entire board must be obtained before any person is employed in any department and all salaries are to be fixed by the executive committee.  The rules fixed Saturday of each week as the regular day for meetings of the committee.  These rules were adopted.</p>
                            <p>The managers of departments were then called on to state the needs of their departments in the way of assistance.  Chairman Lindsey, manager of the ways and means department, reported that for the present he would require only one man to take general charge and devote the greater part of his time to getting subscriptions from people who have not yet subscribed to stock.  Mr. Lindsey was authorized to employ such a man as he had designated.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater, manager of the department of publicity, reported that he would require one chief of the press bureau to commence immediately the work of preparing the press notices of the exposition and descriptive matter of all kinds for circulation over the entire transmississippi region.  Mr. Rosewater said this work was of such importance that it would be necessary to employ one stenographer and one typewriter.  He was authorized to employ the assistance he had indicated.</p>
                            <p>Manager Hitchcock of the department of promotion said the only help he would need at present would be a typewriter to turn out correspondence.  The method to be pursued in securing subscriptions from other states was discussed and several plans were suggested, but the matter was laid over for future consideration.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall of the department of buildings and grounds said he would not need any assistance at present, but would probably require the services of an engineer and an architect as soon as the site is decided upon.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TO EMPLOY AN EXPERT.</head>
                            <p>E. E. Bruce, manager of the department of exhibits, said he had not formulated definite plans for his department beyond outlining sixteen bureaus.  How many chiefs of bureaus he would require he said he had not decided, but he desired to employ one man of experience in exposition matters.  He was authorized to make such arrangements as he saw fit.</p>
                            <p>A. L. Reed of the department of concessions wanted the opinion of the committee as to the advisability of having all the adjuncts of the exposition operated under concessions.  After discussing the matter it was decided that this would be more satisfactory than for the committee to attempt to operate any of the adjuncts.  Mr. Reed announced that he would need one clerk for the present at a nominal salary.  The authority was granted to employ a suitable person.</p>
                            <p>W. N. Babcock, manager of the department of transportation, reported that he would not need any assistance for the present.</p>
                            <p>The subject of a Woman's department was broached by President Wattles, who advised the establishment of such a department, the head of which should be a member of the executive committee.  There was a difference of opinion among the members as to the method to be pursued in establishing such a department and the matter was referred to Messrs. Wattles and Bruce to devise a plan and submit it at the next meeting of the committee.</p>
                            <p>The question of a salary for the secretary was suggested, but was laid over without action until the next meeting of the committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater was the first head of a department to announce the appointment of a bureau chief.  Shortly after the meeting adjourned he announced that he had appointed J. B. Haynes as chief of the press bureau and Mr. Haynes had signified his acceptance of the position.  This bureau will be put in full working order at once and the people of the transmississippi states will be furnished with information regarding the plan and scope of the exposition and the benefit to be derived from it by each of the western states.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Haynes is a newspaper man of sixteen years' experience and was managing editor of The Bee for eight years.  For the past year and a half he has been actively engaged as correspondent for the large dailies in all of the principal cities in the west and a large number of metropolitan papers in eastern cities.  His extensive newspaper experience and connection with leading papers is expected to greatly enhance the work of the press bureau.  Mr. Haynes is at present an active member of the executive committee of the Commercial club.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>A delay of twenty-four hours in the transmission of the certificate of the Transmississippi Exposition organization has ensued on account of the discovery that the secretary of state neglected to impress his official seal upon the great red wafer pasted on the certificate of the legality of the incorporation of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association.  The document was sent back to the secretary this morning and it is expected to be returned this evening, at which time the necessary information will be immediately transmitted to the Treasury department.</p>
                            <p>Secretary John A. Wakefield has announced his intention of resigning his position as a director of the exposition association, which will leave a vacancy to be filled by the board of directors.</p>
                            <p>It has been the sentiment of the members of the directory that the secretary should be paid a salary, as he will have to devote all his time to the duties of his office, but the resolution unanimously adopted at the last meeting prohibits a director from receiving any compensation for his services in any capacity in connection with the exposition and it has been understood that Mr. Wakefield will resign.  Judging from the sentiment which developed at the meeting at which the first vacancy was filled, the vacancy caused by Mr. Wakefield's resignation will be filled by the election of a director from either South Omaha or Iowa.  Both interests are demanding recognition, and the sentiment in the board seems to be in favor of recognizing both.  Iowa has one representative on the board in the person of Lucien Wells of Council Bluffs, a business man of high standing in the city over the river and also in the state.  The packing center of the west has no representative in the directory and is making most strenuous efforts for consideration.</p>
                            <p>E. E. Bruce, chief of the department of exhibits, returned to the city last night and was seen at his office today.  He said he had been flooded all morning with personal applications for positions in his department and had not had time to open his morning mail.  Aside from a few moments devoted to the subject last night, Mr. Bruce said he had not given the details of the work in his department much consideration and had done nothing beyond outlining, in a general way, his conception of the plan and scope of the department which <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall of the department of buildings and grounds said he was prepared to make no report till after the location had been settled.  His idea was to secure a competent engineer at the proper time to plot the grounds, and an architect to suggest plans for construction.  He would also advertise for competitive designs for such buildings as the exposition company would construct.</p>
                            <p>E. E. Bruce of the department of exhibits did not ask for any assistance at this meeting.  He had divided his department into sixteen bureaus at this time, but thought he would consolidate some of them and reduce the number.  He was authorized to temporarily employ an experienced man to suggest the best method of interesting exhibitors in the exposition.</p>

                            <p>A. L. Reed of the department of concessions would only occasionally need a stenographer at this time.  After studying and comparing plans for the letting of privileges he had concluded the best way was to sell them outright or let them on a percentage plan, rather than operate them.  He contemplates a visit to the Nashville exposition to learn of the methods adopted there.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Babcock of the department of transportation had nothing to offer at this meeting, as it was too early for his department to being work.</p>
                            <p>Those managers asking for help at once had their requests granted, and they were ordered to employ such persons as they felt were competent to do the work required.</p>
                            <p>The question of the organization of a woman's auxiliary board was brought up, and was referred to a committee composed of Wattles, Bruce and Hitchcock for development.</p>
                            <p>The committee adjourned to meet next Saturday at the same hour and place.  The by-laws adopted call for a weekly meeting at this time, and such other meetings as the committee may order by resolution, or may be called by the chairman.</p>

                            <p>The committee appointed at a previous meeting to prepare by-laws reported, and submitted by-laws for the directory and for the executive committee.  Both sets were read and amended in a small degree.</p>
                            <p>A letter from R. W. Furnas, applying for the position of director general, was read and ordered filed.</p>
                            <p>A letter was read from a friend of the exposition in Montana asking the board to recommend to the incoming governor of that state to appoint the outgoing governor as vice president of the exposition for Montana.

He will recommend a man at the next meeting.  He thought a date ought to be made on which a committee from the directory should meet the officers of the railroads in Chicago and arrange for subscriptions from them.  He was authorized to make the date himself and select his committee.  He also suggested that the executive committee should make a trip to Nashville and Atlanta to study the plans adopted in those cities and secure pointers for their guidance.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater of the department of publicity said he would need a chief for a press bureau and a stenographer.  Prolonged discussion occurred as to the amount of salary to be paid.  Sentiment of the members was strong for rigid economy.  Mr. Rosewater said his force would have plenty to do for the next few months.  He expects to write a personal letter to the publisher of each important newspaper in the Trans-Mississippi country asking for favorable mention of the exposition, and his department would prepare articles concerning the exposition for the use of all publications desiring them as a news feature.  The matter of advertising the exposition would not be undertaken till some time late next year.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock of the department of promotion said he would want a clerk in this city, and would like to be authorized to secure an agent in each state from which an appropriation was expected.  Communication would be opened at once to secure the names of all the legislators in the different states, and with the vice presidents who had been appointed, and steps taken to make these people familiar with the legislative acts which have been adopted in reference to the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DEPARTMENT HEADS BEGIN THEIR WORK</head>
                            <head type="sub">Managers of the Big Show Likely to Amend the Rules that They May Select Their Own Employes.</head>
                            <p>The work of getting the Transmississippi and International Exposition under way is proceeding as rapidly as the magnitude of the undertaking will admit.  The members of the executive committee are finding that the rules adopted for their government at the meeting last Saturday are more of a detriment than anything else.  The provision requiring each manager of a department to submit the names of his appointees to the executive committee for its approval necessitates a serious delay in each case and prevents the work from proceeding as rapidly as would be the case if each manager were empowered to employ a stipulated number of persons at a stated salary in each case.  Already several of the managers are chafing under the restraint they have thus imposed upon themselves and some of them are talking of amending the rules at the next meeting to modify this provision.  Those who have expressed themselves in this regard say they believe in allowing each manager the utmost freedom in the personnel of his department, as he is responsible for its operation and should not be restricted in the exercise of his judgment.</p>
                            <p>Manager Lindsey of the ways and means department announced this morning that he had made temporary arrangements with C. A. Starr, the well known real estate man of this city, to act as his assistant in organizing the department.  The appointment of Mr. Starr will be submitted to the executive committee at its next meeting by Mr. Lindsey and permanent arrangements will then be made.  For the present Mr. Starr will devote his time to making a list of persons and corporations who have not subscribed to exposition stock and will arrange for committees to call upon these parties and endeavor to secure subscriptions.  Such committees will visit Chicago and confer with the authorities of the railroads and will also visit the packers in South Omaha who have not yet subscribed.  Mr. Lindsey expects to secure large additions to the stock subscription list.  Other plans will be devised to enlarge the income of the exposition association.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity has opened temporary headquarters in room No. 601, Bee building, Mr. Rosewater having offered this room, rent free, until other quarters are secured.  In this room J. B. Haynes, chief of the press bureau, is installed and has entered actively upon the work of the bureau.  Press matter and personal letters are being prepared and will be forwarded at once.</p>
                            <p>Manage Bruce of the Department on Exhibits is negotiating with an expert in exposition affairs, but said he had nothing definite to say yet.  The party with whom he has opened negotiations has had a wide and varied experience in the minute details of conducting a large exposition and many of the present board of directors have improved the opportunity offered by his presence in the city to increase their fund of knowledge on a subject with presents so many difficulties to the ordinary mortal.  Mr. Bruce said his negotiations had not progressed far enough to warrant him in making and announcement to the public.</p>

                            <p>Valentine Republican:  Nebraska cannot afford to not do her share toward making the Transmississippi Exposition a great success.  Every town in the state should lend assistance, as the exposition will not only be a benefit to Omaha, but also to the entire state.</p>
                            <p>Schuyler Herald:  No doubt all of the states in the central west will make appropriations to aid the Transmississippi Exposition.  In this regard Nebraska can well afford to be more liberal than any of her neighbors, for she will derive the greatest benefit.  We believe there will be no trouble experienced in securing a liberal appropriation at the hands of our lawmakers.</p>
                            <p>Hastings Tribune:  Officers have been elected for the Transmississippi and International Exposition, which will be held in Omaha in 1898.  Gurdon W. Wattles was chosen president.  All officers will serve without pay.  The selection of the site is set for early in January.  The big show is bound to be a success, regardless of the Rocky Mountain News or anything else that may bob up to oppose it.</p>
                            <p>Crete Vidette:  Nebraska never does anything in a small way.  One year she sends a shipload of grain to suffering Russia and the next year she goes dry and calls upon the state for $150,000 with which to purchase seed.  And this year of our Lord 1896 she comes up smiling with a crib filled with 350,000,000 bushels of corn.  Now she is getting ready to give the people one of the finest exhibitions of pluck, perseverance and products in the year 1898 ever set before the American people.</p>
                            <p>Kearney Sun:  The Transmississippi Exposition starts out with a strong directory and initial meetings show a harmony and unanimity of purpose that will surely bring success if the people of all the state do their part.  The directors and officers are among Omaha's strongest business men and their selection will carry confidence not only to the people of all the state do their part.  The directors and officers are among Omaha's strongest business men and their selection will carry confidence not only to the people of the state, but throughout the states to whose united efforts the exposition will have to look for success.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Experiment of Early Spring Runs to the Fair Grounds and Elmwood.</head>
                            <p>The Omaha Street Railway company will put a twelve minute car service on the line to the state fair grounds and Elmwood park Wednesday, Arbor Day, to accommodate the people who wish to go out to the grounds for pleasure or sight-seeing.  After that date, for a few days, there will be an hourly service, which will be continued as long as the receipts cover operating expenses.  The management, however, has little faith that the traffic will warrant the continuing of this service, as it feels it is too early in the season and too few people on the extended service to draw travel from.</p>
                            <p>The company will soon commence putting its open cars into service, the Park and Sherman avenue lines to be the first served.  There will be but one open car on each train till the weather gets settled, and the passenger will then be privileged to take their choice.  After May 1 the open cars will be nearly the general thing.</p>

                            <dateline>Omaha, Nebr. May 20th, 1903.</dateline>
                            <ab>Chas. F. Manderson, Chairman <lb/> Committee of Revision and Approval, <lb/> Omaha, Nebr.</ab>
                            <l>My Dear Sir:</l>
                            <p>You will remember that in June, 1902, the Board of Directors of the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition, placed upon the writer the duty of collecting and compiling a story of that enterprise, upon completion of which he was to deliver same to the Committee of which you are Chairman, for their revision and approval, and upon receiving same it was to be filed in the Omaha Public Library as a record.</p>
                            <p>Pursuant to this instruction I hand you herewith the result of my labors in this direction, and I trust that after your Committee has given full consideration and careful attention to the subject matter, that it may in the main, at least, receive your approval.  The relation of the story, is I think, complete, except that a chapter on "Architecture of the Exposition" which Mr. Thomas R. Kimball kindly consented to write, has not as yet been received.  Mr. Kimball now assures me that it will shortly be forthcoming, and I hope to be able soon to send you same for insertion in its proper place in the story herewith transmitted to you.</p>
                            <p>It is sincerely hoped that a way may be found through which the publication of this history may be secured.  If pubilished it should of necessity be very profusely illustrated, because in this case pictures may tell the story better than the written relation.</p>
                            <p>If arrangements can be made for publication, all the illustrations needed can be readily secured, as photographs and pictures are available when needed for such purpose.</p>
                            <p>Should you or the Committee desire to communicate with me at any time relative to this subject, please address me
