                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday saw the close of the second month of the exposition, and while complete figures are not yet obtainable, it is stated that it will make as satisfactory a showing in the way of reducing indebtedness as did June.  The operating force has been reduced to what is regarded as bedrock, making the daily operating expenses about $2,000.  Estimates based on partly completed reports are to the effect that the month's receipts will approximate $125,000, or an average of about $4,000 a day.</p>
                            <p>The third Sunday with a reduced admission rate was practically a duplicate of its predecessor so far as attendance was concerned.  The evening was so cool that a number of overcoats and heavy wraps were seen on the grounds.  The Indian camp was something of a drawing card, although few of the redskins are yet on the ground, and the exhibit buildings on the north tract had more visitors in proportion to the number on the grounds than on any previous day.  The indications are that the coming of the Indians will bring the whole north tract into greater prominence than it has thus far received.</p>

                            <head type="sub">REDMEN ON MIDWAY.</head>
                            <p>The only Indians who have yet arrived are a party of Brule Sioux, made up of bucks, squaws and <choice><sic>pappooses</sic><corr>papooses</corr></choice>.  Another party of fifty-eight Omahas and Winnebagoes are expected in this morning.  Agents Wise and Liddiard took the Brules down the Midway, and they were invited into all the concessions.  The sight of the bucks in full paint and feather trying to preserve Indian stolidity while being rocked and pitched on the hurricane decks of the camels in the oriental streets was itself worth double the price of admission.  The younger squaws did not try to conceal their pleasure.</p>
                            <p>The North Central Kansas Editorial association reached the grounds yesterday, about fifty of the members being present.  In the party were C. L. Landis, president of the association; Secretary Grace L. Snyder of Cawker City and President S. H. Dodge of the Kansas State Press association.  C. S. Stiles, the Missouri Pacific's passenger and ticket agent for Kansas, had the party in charge.  Press Commissioner Richardson took them in tow and provided passes and showed the visitors about the grounds.  At 4 o'clock this afternoon they will assemble at the Press building, and President Wattles and other officials of the exposition will meet them.</p>
                            <p>Mura Matani, an attache of the Streets of All Nations, became bellicose yesterday afternoon and insisted that he wanted to imbibe a little gore.  No one else in the locality was inclined to supply a meal for him and he was locked up to cool off.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">SWORD DANCER STABBED.</head>
                            <p>Later in the evening blood flowed plentifully at the Streets of All Nations, the sword dancer, Kahllil Zernny, being stabbed three time by Kahllil Wardeeny, who is employed at his brother's restaurant near the Twentieth street entrance, just outside the grounds.  Wardeeny visited the Streets and a quarrel quickly resulted.  The men came to blows and the stabbing ensued.  Wardeeny fled, but was captured near the Service building.  He denied any knowledge of the stabbing, but was identified by a dozen witnesses and was sent to the county jail, charged with assault with intent to kill.  It is stated that the men had trouble in the old country, and again at Nashville last year.</p>
                            <p>Zernny's injuries consisted of a gash four inches long just below the left shoulder blade, and slight cuts on the head and shoulder.  He was sewed up and allowed to depart, as no serious results are anticipated.  The knife with which the cutting was done was picked up at the scene of the trouble.  It is a small pearl-handled affair, and the blade was considerably bent from striking a bone.</p>
                            <p>There was considerable excitement at the Southern California Ostrich Farm yesterday.  A large crowd was present about 3 o'clock in the afternoon and, as is usual, a bird was picked out for the jockey to ride.  William McKinley was the bird selected and the jockey had ridden around the farm once or twice when the bird became frightened at a dog near by.  He jumped through a hole in the fence, throwing the boy heavily to the ground.  A broken wrist for the jockey and a few bruises for the bird were the result.</p>
                            <p>Hess, the noted lion wrestler at Hagenback's Wild Animal show, barely escaped with his head last night, and as it is he has ten stitches in his nose this morning.  He was finishing his wrestling match with the lion Prince and placed his head in the animal's mouth.  When he was withdrawing his head his fingers slipped from Prince's lips and the stout jaws came together with force.  He was quick enough to save his head, but his nose was terribly lacerated and he was taken to the hospital for repairs.</p>
                            <p>A most interesting and instructive exhibition will open on West Midway tomorrow.  It is to be known as the X Ray, and is said to be very wonderful.  The machine, the largest ever manufactured, was made to order for show purposes only, and a large audience will be enabled to see the exhibition at the same time.  Numerous tests will be given at each performance.  The old professor, who will deliver instructive lectures, will be assisted by Miss Eva Le Roy in the tests.  The building which will be occupied by this show is one of the most attractive on the Midway.  It is located near the Ostrich Farm.</p>

                        <div2 type="article">
                            <p>There is gloom in the Chinese village, and the gloom is shared by those who have been delighted with the performances of the 10-year-old son of Ching Ling Foo.  The little fellow was a splendid athlete, and his solemn eyes, prematurely old face and lithe limbs made him a striking figure.  Wednesday the boy died suddenly and Ching Ling Foo is broken hearted.  The father is a magician, but all of his skill and magic will not bring back to life his dead boy.  The white badge of mourning is worn by the father and by the villagers, and the smoke of incense is wafted upon the breezes that play up and down the Midway.  Outside all is merrymaking, but behind the scenery of the Chinese theater there is gloom and tears and heartaches.</p>
                            <p>But Ching Ling Foo, bowed down with sorrow must still satisfy the demand for feats of magic.  With hear nearly broken he steps to the front of the stage and astonishes the multitudes.  When the applause comes he bows and smiles, but tears lurk in the smiles, and his thoughts are not of his triumphs but of the inanimate clay awaiting interment.</p>
                            <p>The singers continue to sing, but in the weird notes of their songs is <choice><sic>descernable</sic><corr>discernible</corr></choice> a strain of pathos, for the singers are thinking of the lithe and active boy who was the life of the village.  Tough young men still gather on the Midway and say "smart" things to the "Chinks," and the "Chinks" reply not, for down town rests the body of the little athlete and their thoughts are with him or roaming through the vales of the Flowery Kingdom.  The little Chinese baby toddles about the garden and calls shrilly for her brother.  The gong and the cymbals make harsh discords, and the clacking billets of wood split the air with sounds that grate harshly upon the American ear.  The dancers dance and the play goes on, but even Chinese men and women love, and their hearts are filled with sorrow for the little boy lying in Chinese state down town.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Concessionaire James A. Griffiths of the Scenic Railway is naturally elated over news that suits that have been pending for some time over alleged infringement of patents have been decided in his favor.  Mr. Griffiths is the patentee of the combination clutch used on the cable feature of the railway, by means of which the car catches the cable automatically at the bottom of the incline and releases it at the top.</p>
                            <p>The Scenic Railway represents a combination of the old <choice><sic>switchbac</sic><corr>switchback</corr></choice>, or gravity road, and the cable and tunnel system.  The one at the exposition grounds is the largest and most complete of the half dozen that are in operation in the United States.  The round trip covers a length of 4,200 feet.  The ups and downs of the gravity road are much accentuated, the cable being used to carry the cars to the tops of the hills that they could not reach by gravity headway alone.  The patent clutch grasps the cable without making any stop or interfering in any way with the movement of the car, and, on reaching the summit, "trips" itself, and the car goes whizzing on to the next incline and into the tunnel.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>The scenic effect is artificially presented in the tunnel, which is artistically painted, and illuminated with electric lights.  The effect is striking as the car dashes through fairy grottos with their countless stalagmite and stalactite formations, past miniature lakes, on which appear the bulky outlines of a fleet of battleships, and in rapid succession from one to another of a series of optical surprises that invariably please the wondering passenger.</p>
                            <p>Probably the most striking view that is presented to the eye over the Scenic Railway is that which burst upon the vision as the <choice><sic>cah</sic><corr>car</corr></choice> emerges from the tunnel and the brilliant beauty of the exposition grounds spreads itself in extended range.  It is a scene that never fails to impress the beholder, and thousands have repeated the trip solely for the purpose of witnessing that sight again.  From no other point on the grounds does the general view of the whole surroundings appeal to the imagination with so much force.  Not even on the grand court itself does the illumination from the viaduct towers on the east to the government dome on the west give the impression of fairyland grandeur that takes possession of the beholder at the moment he emerges from the Scenic Railway tunnel as he begins his return trip.  The thousands of electric lights seem multiplied to millions, while the succession of domes and pinnacles and minarets apparently belong to a dreamland that he has <choice><sic>nevr</sic><corr>never</corr></choice> visited before.</p>

                            <p>Cars have been received sufficient to equip six trains, but even with this number the facilities are taxed to their fullest capacity on big days.  On the Fourth of July the road carried 9,000 passengers, and on last Thursday evening it became necessary to regulate the admissions to the platforms by means of the gates.</p>
                            <p>The <choice><sic>dlays</sic><corr>delays</corr></choice> that were occasioned during the opening days were due solely to the work of adjusting the clutches, all of the construction being new, and now that this has been accomplished, the trains run with the regularity of clockwork.  Mr. Griffiths states that after the adjustment is perfected on a new road the operation is as methodical as the rising and setting of the sun.</p>

                            <p>At the exposition concert tonight on the Grand Plaza there will be music of more than ordinary interest.  In addition to the piece which has created so much enthusiasm on preceding nights&#8212;namely, the battle piece entitled "From Battlefield to Fireside," with pyrotechnic effects, Superintendent Kelly is arranging two special numbers, which will elicit much applause and interest.</p>
                            <p>If Captain Mercer's Indians can be secured there will be a living picture of thrilling intensity.</p>
                            <p>To lovers of the great and late lamented Bismarck the special extra number, "In Memoriam," which is not on the regular program, will be acceptable.</p>

                            <p>Captain Mercer's Brule Sioux Indians made a hit last night.  During the early evening they clothed themselves in the war toggery and marched from the camp to Twentieth street and down that thoroughfare to the Administration building.  Upon reaching there they marched around the lagoon, singing war songs and giving an imitation of the old time war whoop.  They attracted a great crowd and before they had gone half way around the Lagoon, half of the people on the grounds were following in their wake.</p>

                            <p>Monday morning brought the usual influx of country visitors to the exposition, and many of them came with the expectation of remaining during the week.  The early arrivals were largely composed of excursionists who were dropped from the trains at the north entrance, but other who were brought into the downtown depots came straggling out on the street cars later on.  It was one of the most enjoyable <choice><sic>mornings</sic><corr>morning</corr></choice> yet experienced on the grounds, and people who came expecting to be broiled and wilted by the heat were happily disappointed.</p>
                            <p>The midsummer quietude that has characterized the exposition during the past two weeks will now give place to a series of brilliant spectacles and celebrations that will continue almost without intermission until the gates close for the last time and the White City is deserted.  This is the last day of inaction.  Tomorrow the gorgeous floral pageantry of Flower day will appropriately introduce a succession of events that will give variety and zest to the enterprise and furnish a vast scope of entertainment for the hundreds of thousands of visitors that are expected during the remaining three months.  These will include a wide variety of features, spectacular, fraternal and educational.  They will keep public interest excited and assist to make the exposition memorable after its glittering palaces have disappeared.</p>
                            <p>The program this week is punctuated with three big days, aside from the special musical attractions of the evenings.  Very low railroad rates have been secured on each occasion and a largely increased out of town attendance is expected.  The flower parade Tuesday evening is something entirely novel in this part of the country and its success elsewhere is a sufficient indication that the spectacle will prove highly entertaining.  The decorations of various equipages that will form the parade have been practically completed and they display a degree of taste and artistic mingling of colors that will be especially pleasing in the magnificent landscaping of the bluff tract.  The parade will form promptly at 6 o'clock and will move half an hour after, preceding by Phinney's band and the board of governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben.  It will make the circuit of the bluff tract three times and will be followed by an informal reception by the women of the Bureau of Entertainment at their quarters in the Mines building.</p>

                            <p>Indian day on Thursday will bring another novel spectacle in which over thirty tribes of men will illustrate their native dress, customs and sports.  This will occupy the entire day and will be concluded with a magnificent display of fireworks.  Saturday Kansas City will transport itself to the grounds and several thousands of its people will swell the crowd and celebrate its participation in the Transmississippi enterprise.</p>
                            <p>No suggestion of subsequent bustle and activity was apparent on the grounds yesterday where a good sized crowd passed the afternoon and evening in quiet enjoyment of the pretty scenery and delightful music.  The skies were ominous early in the day, but the reduced admission was a strong attraction and all the afternoon there was a constant inflow of people.  The afternoon concert was given in the rotunda of the Mines building and the change was generally commended.  The lofty arch acted as a sounding board and the music was clearly audible all over the main court.  Among the notable selections were the overtures <unclear reason="torn"/> the "Pilgrim's Chorus," from Tannhauser, Mendelsshon's "Songs Without Words," and the medley "with the Minstrels."  The evening program was played in the Auditorium as it was thought the building would be more comfortable than the open air and included a succession of popular favorites which caught the fancy of the crowd and elicited numerous encores.</p>
                            <p>This evening the grand fantasie, "From Battlefield to Fireside" will be again repeated on the Plaza with the assistance of the exposition chorus.  In the first part the chorus will sing the Sicilian hymn, "Let the Hills and Vales Resound," by Richards and "Robin Adair."  The band selections are especially attractive.  They include the overture from "Semiramide," the waltz, "Jolly Fellows," by Vollstedt, a selection from "Wang" and Bellstedt's magnificent descriptive composition, "The Indian War Dance."  The fantasie with the same vocal and pyrotechnical accompaniment that marked its previous production will occupy the last half of the evening.</p>

                            <p>The hour of the parade on Indian day has been changed from 10 o'clock to 1:30.  It was suggested that many people who would like to witness the demonstration would not be able to come out in the forenoon, and that the later hour would be more satisfactory to all concerned.  The change will enable visitors to come out after lunch and still be in time to see every feature of the day.</p>
                            <p>The parade will form on North Twentieth street and march east through the Midway, and thence south to the Horticultural building.  From there it will countermarch and pass back in front of the band stand and through the Midway to the Indian village on the north tract.</p>
                            <p>The entire encampment will be open to the public through the afternoon and evening.  Immediately after the parade there will be an exhibition of Indian dances and sports, including the "medicine" dance by the Winnebago tribe, and a game of la crosse by the Chippewas.  In the evening the Omahas will show their tribal dances, and the Indian band of thirty pieces will give a concert.  This will be followed by a brilliant fireworks display.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ISSUING THE PRESS PASSES.</head>
                            <head type="sub">President Wattles and Other Exposition Officers Learn the Work.</head>
                            <p>Since Friday afternoon, when Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity declined to longer perform the thankless task of dispenser of press passes subject to the interference of the board of directors, certain other exposition officials have been acquiring some practical experience of the difficulties of the position.  Saturday morning Mr. Rosewater referred all applications for passes to President Wattles, with the statement that he would have nothing more to do with them and long before the end of the day President Wattles had some decidedly enlarged ideas in regard to the pass business.  He discovered that it means a continual inundation of applications, among which there were many that presented perplexing propositions that it was impossible to satisfactorily adjust.</p>
                            <p>While President Wattles was sweating under the pressure of these personal applications, the Bureau of Admissions was literally overwhelmed with letters from every part of the United States containing urgent requests for passes.  In many cases it was almost impossible to determine whether the applicants were entitled to them or not and the bureau was soon confronted with a lot of tangled propositions that it had never dreamed of.  One day of it was enough and Saturday night Mr. Rosewater was vigorously urged to take the matter on his own shoulders again.  President Wattles declared that the pass business had occupied his entire time all day and it was absolutely impossible for him to think of carrying such a burden.  Mr. Rosewater replied that it had also been taking his time, which is as valuable as anyone's.  He has given a large portion of his time to this single matter with a view to keeping it on a business basis, but he does not propose to continue to do so unless he is allowed to act without interference.  He said he would not re-assume the responsibility unless the action of the board of directors in granting passes was rescinded.</p>
                            <p>One sample of the manner in which the press department has been handicapped came up Friday morning.  Each member of the executive committee is allowed one book containing fifty trip passes a week.  While this has been ample for the heads of some departments, it was far from being adequate to meet the demand on the Department of Publicity on account of the large number of newspaper men fro<unclear reason="torn"/> sections of the country that were con<unclear reason="torn"/>asking for recognition.  This department has issued an average of thirty-five trip passes a day since the exposition opened to these applicants.  As the Publicity department is the only one required to enable press people with requisitions for term or season passes to get into the grounds to present their requisitions to the admissions bureau in the service building.  When the first fifty passes were exhausted Mr. Rosewater has drawn on the Admissions department for such additional passes as are necessary to satisfy the demand.  Friday his requisition was turned down by Superintendent Boehme of the Admissions department and he was left without the means to give visiting editors entrance to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Another incident in illustration of the propositions that come before the pass dispenser occurred last week.  M. L. Zook, business manager of the American, applied for two passes.  This publication for years has lost no opportunity to libel Mr. Rosewater, but Mr. Zook was at once notified that his application was favorably considered and that the passes would be mailed to him in a day or two.  Yesterday Mr. Rosewater received the following letter from John C. Thompson repudiating the action of Mr. Zook:</p>
                            <p>OMAHA, July 31.&#8212;Mr. Edward Rosewater, Manager Department of Publicity of the Transmississippi Exposition:  Dear Sir&#8212;Your letter notifying me that Mr. Zook's application for passes for himself and wife had been acted upon favorably and that passes would be mailed in a few days has been received.  Any favors extended Mr. Zook as a private citizen and not as a representative of the American concern only the exposition management and himself.  But any favors extended him as a representative of the American and not as a private citizen concern me, and I do not care to stultify myself by either asking or accepting a pass in my own name or that of any officer of this corporation and must request that no passes be issued on account of the American.  This paper has not done anything that justifies any man in asking a pass of the Transmississippi Exposition.  Trusting you will see the propriety of the step I have taken, I remain very respectfully,</p>

                            <head type="sub">New Orleans Man Offers a Pertinent Pointer to the Directors.</head>
                            <p>"I've been to every big exposition since the Centennial at Philadelphia held in this country and saw the last one at Paris and I want to say to you that in the Transmississippi Exposition you have a wonder and a beauty, only equaled by the World's fair at Chicago," said James W. Hearn of New Orleans to a Bee reporter after a half week spent at the exposition grounds.  Continuing he said:  "The buildings are stately, and yet they are attractive.  The landscape work is beautiful and the magnificent proportions of the grand court and the buildings about it, so brilliantly illuminated at night, as such as to make one want to stay there forever.  Nothing equalled this at the World's fair.  The Midwinter fair at California couldn't touch it.  And Atlanta was not 1-2-3 compared with it.</p>
                            <p>"It may be presumption for me to give you advice, but I want to suggest that your directors cannot do a wiser thing than extend the 25-cent admission for the evenings.  I was out there for the first time on Thursday night and I was just <choice><sic>carired</sic><corr>carried</corr></choice> away with delight and surprise when I saw the beautiful scene being admired by so many thousand people.  Then I was out again the next night and there were not a half dozen people around the grand court.  Nothing succeeds like success.  It's better to have a big crowd there to enjoy the beautiful scene at 25 cents a head than nobody there at all.  Your average workingman cannot take his family out there if he has to pay 50 cents, but he will go pretty often at 25 cents.  Your people will not fully appreciate the exposition and its wonderful attractions, perhaps, until it is gone.  Then they will miss it sorely.  But there will be greater enjoyment of it and more real, uplifting benefit done to the people generally if they can enjoy their evenings at the exposition for 25 cents."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hearn is one of the most prominent men of the Crescent city.  He is one of the leaders on the committees that share the work of arranging the famous Mardi Gras festivals.  Last year he handsomely entertained Messrs. William R. Bennett, Dudley Smith and E. M. Bartlett, when they went down to New Orleans for the Board of Governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben.  While here last week he was looked after by Mr. Bennett who reciprocated some of the courtesies shown the knights.  From here Mr. Hearn went to Mackinac island, where he will meet his family and take them east for the summer.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Philadelphia Lawyer Urges His Fellow Citizens to Get in Now.</head>
                            <p>United States Attorney J. M. Beck of Philadelphia, who delivered the eloquent address at the exposition July 4, has returned to Philadelphia, where he expressed in a public interview his regret that his state was not more properly represented.  "The Omaha Exposition," he said, "would alone justify the length of the journey.  The buildings, while not as large as those at Chicago or Philadelphia, are designed with great taste and are effectively grouped upon a noble lagoon which reminds one of the Chicago 'Court of Honor.'  The illuminations at night have, I think, never been surpassed at any similar exposition.  Instead of the arc light the buildings are outlined by 40,000 incandescent lights and the effect is beautiful beyond expression.  So far as the exhibitions are concerned they admirably illustrate the great agricultural and mineral resources of the west and the culture of the transmississippi region.  As an international exposition the war has made it a disappointment, but there is ample to interest and instruct any one.</p>
                            <p>"I could not but greatly regret the entire absence of any exhibits from either Philadelphia or Pennsylvania; neither has a building and the matchless resources of of the editors journeyed to the grounds, where they remained during the evening, looking over the main building and attending the Midway attractions.</p>
                            <p>The Kansas editors are well pleased with the exposition and express astonishment at the magnitude of the concern.  During their stay on the grounds, their headquarters will be at the Kansas State building on the Bluff tract.  C. W. Landis is president and Miss Grace L. Snyder is secretary of the association.  S. H. Dodge, president of the Kansas Press association, is a member of the party.  The Welfare of the newspaper people is looked after by Passenger Agent Stiles of the Missouri Pacific, who attends to the Kansas passenger business.</p>

                            <p>Some sixty editors of the North Central Editorial association of Kansas are in the city for the purpose of attending the exposition.  Many of them are accompanied by their wives, and all will remain until the last of the week.  They arrived early yesterday morning and were met at the depot by Colonel Richardson of the Department of Publicity.  He conducted them to the Mercer hotel, where in a short speech, he extended the freedom of the city, inviting them to the exposition.  During the day most this city and state are unrepresented.  Whose fault this is I do not pretend to say, but that our people have made a great mistake I am confident.  The western people are more appreciative of attention and they resent being ignored.  Had the Philadelphia merchants made an adequate exhibit of our great manufacturing industries they would have gained the lasting friendship of a section which numbers 22,000,000 people.  It is true that we have been no more remiss than other eastern states, but this fact makes our opportunity to make valuable business connections in the west the greater.  It is not too late and either the governor or the mayor should move in the matter. or the Trades league should take it up independently and show the west that we feel an interest in its great exposition."</p>

                            <p>There will be a rehearsal of the exposition chorus at the Auditorium Tuesday evening.</p>
                            <p>The formal dedication of the great organ in the Auditorium will occur Thursday evening, August 11.  The occasion will be celebrated by an elaborate musical program by Harrison Wild of Chicago, assisted by the exposition chorus.  Mr. Wild is one of the foremost organists of the west and has very recently been selected as the conductor of the Chicago Apollo club to succeed William L. Tomlins.</p>
                            <p>The idea of a choral congress in connection with the exposition is received with general approval and the plan promises to be a go.  Assurances have already been secured that the necessary rates will be granted and Superintendent Kelly expects to secure the speakers and issue his circulars before the end of the week.  The date has been informally set for September 21, 22 and 23, and the selection will undoubtedly be approved.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Kelly of the music department is arranged for a series of illustrated concerts on the Plaza with the assistance of W. G. Stephens.  Mr. Stephens is the possessor of a stereopticon and it is proposed to give a series of entertainments, operatic and otherwise, in which the scenic background will be provided by the use of the apparatus.  It is possible that the first of these entertainments will be put on next Monday night.</p>
                            <p>Some of the Midway people are disgruntled on account of the action of the management in refusing to permit the Flower parade to traverse the amusement section.  General Manager Clarkson states that this action was taken on account of the restiveness of many horses in the midst of the unaccustomed noises of the Midway.  As all the vehicles in the parade will be driven by women it was considered inadvisable if not positively dangerous to run the risk of an accident by passing through that part of the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">She Gets Flower Parade Committee to Vote Her an Endorsement.</head>
                            <p>There was a special meeting of the flower parade committee, called by Mrs. Travis, at the Millard hotel this morning.  It was presided over by Mrs. T. M. Orr, and attended by about fifteen women.  The time was occupied by a discussion concerning the reported dissatisfaction with Mrs. Travis' work in arranging for the parade.  No business except the passage of the following resolution was transacted:  "Resolved, That there is no rupture in this committee; that the committee is satisfied with the work of Mrs. Travis, and that the members of the committee refute the statements to the contrary."</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Travis gives this version of her connection with the exposition:  "My correspondence and arrangements have all been with Major Clarkson.  I have had no business dealings with anyone else in connection with the exposition.  When I was concluding my work at Milwaukee in connection with the carnival there I received an offer from Major Clarkson, asking for my terms.  I have invariably charged $400 and my hotel expenses for organizing flower parades.  When I had the opportunity to organize a summer parade for the Transmississippi Exposition I realized the advantage it would be to me in the way of added prestige, so I agreed to do it for $200 and hotel expenses, stipulating that I was to stay at the best hotel in the city.  When I came to Omaha I went to the Millard, and arranging for a room, was told the charge would be $8 per day.  Major Clarkson had made no arrangements for me.  After I had been here two days I was notified by the executive committee of the exposition that I would be allowed only $4 per day for hotel expenses.  I went to the hotel managers and secured the reduction.  That is all I know about the $8 per day.  I have not yet drawn a cent from the exposition treasury, nor do I expect to until my work is completed, when I will receive a check for $200.</p>
                            <p>"I have decorated one carriage, for which I have received a fee of $40.  This is the turnout of Mr. John Cudahy.  Mr. Cudahy had no one to decorate it, and asked me to see that it was taken care of. and I did so.  I was to have decorated the Chiquita carriage and the Montgomery Ward horseless carriage, but there was objection raised to these and I let the matter drop.  Aside from these I have not received or solicited any money for my services from any who expect to take part in the parade.</p>
                            <p>"My time has been at the disposal of the women entirely since I have been here.  I have none but pleasant relations with the Omaha women, with but one exception."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Flower day parade and exercises have been postponed until Friday afternoon at 4 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>There will be fireworks at the grounds tonight.</p>
                            <p>It was stated by the passenger officials of the Omaha terminal lines this afternoon that in all probability the same rates that were made for Flower day will be offered on Friday, to which the day the Flower parade has been postponed.  There will be reduced rates into Omaha on Thursday on account of the opening of the Indian congress, and the plan suggested by several of the passenger officials is to make these reduced rate tickets good for return on the Friday evening trains, allowing the holders to stay over to see the parade on Friday afternoon.  The matter will be decided at a meeting here on Wednesday morning.</p>
                            <p>The rattle of rain drops on roof and foliage in the early morning inspired dismal forebodings in the people who have been working for weeks to make Flower Day one of the distinguishing events of the exposition, but as the rain disappeared with the darkness and the sun occasionally broke through the clouds to flash a promise of brighter skies later in the day, they worked on in the expectation that the conditions would be more favorable in the evening when the grand pageant of the day was to occur.  As the morning wore away and the clouds still gave no signs of clearing, the committee decided to postpone the event.  The certainty of rain made this action imperative.</p>
                            <p>The arrivals at the grounds during the early forenoon were somewhat limited, but the street cars were carrying hundreds of people with valises and traveling bags who dropped off in search of hotels and boarding houses and proceeded to the grounds later in the day.  By 10 o'clock they began to materialize at the exposition and during the remainder of the forenoon every northbound car was heavily loaded.  As the parade does not occur until evening and the bulk of the local attendance is not anticipated until late in the afternoon, there is every prospect of a big crowd.  The amount of baggage carried by the out-of-town arrivals indicated that they proposed to stay to the full limit of their tickets and most of them will be on the grounds again tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>The floral pageant that was to have been the principal feature of Flower day was necessarily postponed on account of the rain, to the great disappointment of everybody.  Those who are familiar with the entrancing effects that have been worked out by Mrs. Travis and her corps of assistants agree that it will present a spectacle that will be worth coming hundreds of miles to see.  There will be upwards of fifty vehicles of all descriptions in the line of march and each will be a marvel of artistic decoration and magnificent coloring.  All sorts of flowers will be used in the decorations, but all will blend in harmony of effect that will emphasize the beauty of the detailed designs.  It has been decided that the procession will be led by the fine double team of President Gurdon W. Wattles.  Half a hundred of Omaha's most prominent society women will drive the beautifully decorated equipages and many more will assist in completing the ensemble by wearing colors that will harmonize with the flowers in which they ride.  The parade will move three times around the Bluff tract headed by Phinney's band and will be reviewed from the band stand by Mayor Moores of Omaha, Mayor Graham of Lincoln and Mayor Jennings of Council Bluffs.  A handsome solid gold souvenir medal will be presented to the driver of the most artistically <choice><sic>decorataed</sic><corr>decorated</corr></choice> vehicle while bronze and silver medals will reward the second and third best respectively.  After the parade the band will give a short concert in the band stand and the women of the Bureau of Entertainment will hold an informal reception in the Mines building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Kansas City Day Grows.</head>
                            <p>Kansas City day grows in importance as the event approaches and it now seems certain that Saturday will bring one of the biggest out of town crowds that has ever yet been on the grounds.  The Kansas City officials and business men who have charge of the arrangements predict that no less than 5,000 people will come from the city on the Kaw to celebrate the occasion and most of them will remain in Omaha for a number of days.  For some days the committee has been endeavoring to secure an additional concession from the railroad companies which would permit the excursionists to make a longer stay at the exposition.  When the flat rate of $4 for the round trip was granted the tickets were limited from Friday evening to Saturday evening, giving the people only one day and evening on the grounds.  This brought out a vigorous protest and the limit has now been extended to Monday night.  The committee kept kicking and there is a satisfactory prospect that the tickets will be put on sale Friday morning, thus allowing the party nearly three full days in Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Invitations have been extended by the local committee of arrangements to the <unclear reason="torn"/> commercial organizations of Kansas City <unclear reason="torn"/> <choice><sic>particiuate</sic><corr>participate</corr></choice> in a body.  The Live Stock exchange has already prepared to make a characteristic demonstration and most of the other organizations will probably follow suit.  The visitors will bring a profusion of bands and handsome badges will be furnished to all members of the party.  The railroads have made elaborate preparations to handle the business and unless all indications fail they will have about all the people they can conveniently carry.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MORE OF THE INDIANS GET IN.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Blackfeet, Assiniboines, Sacs and Foxes on the Ground.</head>
                            <p>The population of the Indian village on the exposition grounds is increasing at a rapid fire, and before tomorrow night it is probable that the majority of the 700 delegates to the congress will have arrived.  A few of the Indians will be slow in coming in, so that it is not though that the full strength of the party will be on the grounds before Thursday morning.  Captain Mercer is pleased with the outlook and feels sure that the success of the undertaking is fully assured.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday twenty-two of the Blackfeet and fifteen of the Assiniboines came in and were located upon the grounds.  The former went into camp on the west side of the enclosure, while the latter were quartered on the open tract east of the office.  Late last night twenty of the Sacs and Foxes arrived from Toledo, Ia., and were made happy by being supplied with rations.  All of the Indians have their interpreters along.  While the late arrivals are fine looking people, they cannot come up to the Brules in either stature or general appearance.  Most of the Indians have brought their ponies, which are tethered in the grass in the open field in the center of the encampment.</p>
                            <p>As yet none of the big braves have come, though in the camp of the Blackfeet there is a man who claims distinction.  He bears the name of He Wets It, and is said to have been a great hunter, able to bring down a deer or elk at almost any distance, so true was his eye and aim in his younger days.  This Indian was always a friend of the whites and at the present time is the Indian chief of police at the agency.</p>
                            <p>The tepees of the Blackfeet are features of the camp.  They are the regulation shape and size, but most of them are of the hides of deer and buffalo, painted and decorated, the studies being representative of the chase.  Interpreter Publo is in charge and never tires of telling tales of the bravery of the men who are being cared for by him.</p>
                            <p>The Assiniboines are looked after by Interpreter Martin, who has lived with them about all of his life.  These Indians are much smaller than either the Brules or the Blackfeet.  They are bright and intelligent and are good farmers.  Their tepees are adorned with pictures done in oil and show some degree of skill.</p>
                            <p>While all of the Indians now on the ground dress in the traditional blanket, most of them have their war bonnets and the equipment used in their fantastic dances, all of which will be worn when they go on dress parade next Thursday.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CHEESE AND BUTTER AND NO COLD.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Dairymen Have Their Occasions for Joy and Causes for Grief.</head>
                            <p>There is some fine cheese in the Dairy building.  It is of the new crop and is pronounced about as good as any ever exhibited.  As a result of this Superintendent Whitcomb is feeling unusually proud.  One of the exhibits came from the creamery at Avoca, Cass county, and the other from Friend.</p>
                            <p>The cheese exhibit in the Dairy building is in charge of B. R. Stouffer of Bellevue, who is an expert in his line.  Speaking of Nebraska cheese, he said: "We will show the world that we live in the great dairy belt of the world.  When our cheese is all in we will gladly invite competition and we will carry off the medals."</p>
                            <p>Just at this time the exhibitors in the Dairy building are having considerable trouble.  There is a refrigerating plant in the structure.  The power is furnished from the plant that furnishes power for the exposition.  It starts up about 6 o'clock in the morning and shuts down at midnight.  Between these hours from midnight until morning, of course, the refrigerator is not doing business.  As a result of this the cases get warm and the butter melts down, evil is a thing that is bothering the men while the cheese moulds.  How to remedy the in charge of the building.  An all night refrigerating service was promised on June 20 and another promise of a like character was made on July 1.  Neither of these promises have been kept and the butter continues to melt.</p>
                            <p>The butter model of Commodore Dewey that was in the Dairy building has melted down simply for the reason that the temperature of the building was allowed to run up into the eighties, and so it goes.  Superintendent Whitcomb says that unless something is done to secure an even temperature in the building it will be impossible to make a creditable exhibit of butter at any time during the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Descriptive Music, a Dirge for Bismarck and an Indian Dance.</head>
                            <p>The oftener the battle piece, "From Battlefield to Fireside," is rendered, the better the people seem to like it.  It was put on again last night and was filled in with specialties that have not been seen before.  The night was perfect and the crowd filled the reserved seats and occupied a greater portion of the standing room on the Plaza.  The pyrotechnic effects were better if anything than those of the previous evening, the red lights, bombs and rockets being fired by electric contact, something that has not been heretofore attempted on this portion of the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>A life-size figure of Prince Bismarck was stationed on one end of the platform.  The figure was in full uniform and covered with the German and American flags, while above were rosettes of black.  As the band struck up a dirge the flags were parted, giving the audience an opportunity of seeing the late German warrior and statesman, apparently looking as natural as life.  Following this the band and chorus rendered three selections and then some fifty of Captain Mercer's Indians, clad in their war bonnets and shirts, ascended the stage and executed a good will dance, accompanied by a song, which when interpreted into English, would be, "When the Corn is Ripe."  This caught the crowd and it applauded for an encore, but as the Indian is not in the encore business, everybody had to be satisfied with the one dance and the one selection.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Kelly feels satisfied with the result of the evening and said last night that he would reproduce the piece again, putting in a number of new and additional features.</p>

                            <p>Within the next few days the Union Pacific will send 50,000 most beautiful souvenirs of the Transmississippi Exposition to be distributed at the principal ticket offices in the east.  This work will be followed up later by placing equally large quantities of the new souvenir in the leading cities of other parts of the country for free distribution.</p>
                            <p>The advertisement of the exposition is in the form of a pocket folder of sixty-two pages and all of these pages save the last four are devoted exclusively to an adequate description of the exposition by pictures and sketches.  The pictures are something entirely new, fine color work being the noteworthy feature.  Light blue tints are used with good effect and help to set off the pictures of the buildings and grounds to the greatest advantage.  In addition to pictures of the main buildings, Grand Court and state buildings there are good representations of Midway scenes and a fair description of the amusement section of the exposition.  Each building is graphically described.  Appended there is a valuable guide for visitors concerning the hotels, public buildings and <choice><sic>others</sic><corr>other</corr></choice> institutions of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The folder has been gotten out by Mr. Darlow under the direction of General Passenger Agent Lomax and reflects great credit on the advertising bureau of the Union Pacific's passenger department.</p>

                            <p>The first Whitehead torpedo that has ever been seen in Nebraska has been added to the navy exhibit in the Government building and is regarded with marked interest by visitors.  The missile is an ingeniously contrived piece of mechanism, but its method of operation is easily understood.  It is shaped almost exactly like a huge cigar.  The larger end contains the explosive, while the other holds the compressed air and engine that furnishes the motive power.  It is propelled by two screws which turn in opposite directions in order to hold the torpedo steady in its flight through the water and behind these are the rudders that can be so set as to keep it at any desired distance from the surface of the water.  The percussion head is protected by a small wheel that is not unlike a tiny propeller, but the action of the water unscrews this and it is dropped a few seconds after the discharge, leaving the projectile ready for business.  Each of these torpedoes cost $3,000.</p>

                            <p>H. C. Gregg of Minneapolis was at the exposition yesterday.  He was just in from Honolulu.  He was there are the time of the arrival of the Nebraska boys who were on their way to Manila to join Commodore Dewey's command.  He says that the boys owned the Hawaiian city while there and that there was nothing too good for them.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the exposition, Mr. Gregg said:  "It is the greatest of the great shows and when the railroads get around to making decent rates it will be a winner.  I am surprised at the class of the exhibits.  They are better than those at the World's Fair.  The buildings are magnificent and the grand court is the most beautiful thing that I ever saw in the exposition line."</p>

                            <p>In accordance with the action of the board of directors, the admission to the grounds will be 25 cents after 7 o'clock Wednesday evening.  The concert will be supplemented by a series of magnificent stereoptican views illustrative of the music.  Superintendent Kelly thinks that this can be made one of the most effective evening features that have yet been attempted, especially in connection with the patriotic selections which will be illustrated by scenes connected with the Cuban war.</p>

Last night Manager Lindsey of the Department of Ways and Means received a telegram stating that the band will start on August 4 and will reach here the night of August 9.

                            <p>B. Sienauk, assistant to Vice President Truesdale of the Rock Island railroad, and his three daughters, are among the exposition visitors today.</p>
                            <p>It has been found necessary to change the date of Montana day from September 12 to September 6.  This is on account of the inability of the governor to come to Omaha on the date first selected.</p>
                            <p>All the flags on the exposition grounds were hung at half mast yesterday in tribute to Bismarck.  This feature was generally commented on by visitors of German extraction, who expressed a lively appreciation of the recognition of the demise of their greatest statesman.</p>
                            <p>W. C. Peeler, traveling passenger agent of the Cotton Belt, who has been in charge of the exhibit in the Agriculture building during the last two weeks, has returned to his home in Memphis, Tenn.  He is succeeded by W. G. Adams, traveling passenger agent of the same road, who is stationed at Nashville, Tenn.</p>
                            <p>The railroad rate that was originally announced for Missouri day has been materially reduced.  Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation succeeded yesterday in securing a rate of 1 cent a mile from Kansas City and intermediate points, as well as within the 150-mile limit.  The rate from other points outside the limit will be one fare for the round trip.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Freid of Fremont is away on a fishing trip and Mayor Jennings of Council Bluffs has consented to act in his place on the committee of judges for the flower parade.  In addition to the souvenir medals a handsome blue banner will be presented to the owner of the most artistically decorated vehicle.  The second best will receive a red banner and the third a white one.</p>
                            <p>Montana day at the exposition is set for September 10, but it is possible that the ceremonies attending the dedication of the building will not be held at that time.  Governor Smith has wired that upon the date named he will be compelled to be at home to attend the meetings of the state boards, of which he is a member by virtue of his office.  He says that he can be here earlier or later, but that it will be impossible to come at the time fixed by the exposition management.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">REDUCED FARES IMPERATIVELY DEMANDED.</hi></head>
                            <p>In order to make the exposition a success in every respect it must be made possible for people with limited means as well as people with abundant means to come to Omaha at a moderate expense.  No matter how anxious people living at a distance of more than 200 miles from Omaha may be to view the beauties of our magnificent exposition, no considerable number living east of the Mississippi or west of the Rockies will venture to gratify their desire unless they can do so at very much lower fares than have prevailed up to this time.  This fact must be as apparent to railway managers as it is to all other people.  The 1-cent-a-mile or one fare for the round trip rate on red-letter days within a 200-mile limit does not meet the want of a low rate for the class of people whom the projectors of the exposition have primarily desired to attract.  In other words, the main object of the exposition&#8212;to advertise the marvelous resources of the country west of the Mississippi to the capitalists looking for profitable investments and people who desire to find new homes&#8212;would be frustrated if the attractions to bring these visitors from New England, New York and the middle states are not supplemented by low railroad fares.</p>
                            <p>While it is not our purpose to arraign the railroads for what they have omitted to do or refused to do toward stimulating travel to Omaha since the opening of the exposition, we deem it our duty to impress upon their passenger departments the universal demand for concessions that will enable tourists, investors and home seekers to patronize the exposition and incidentally familiarize themselves with the region whose varied products are on exhibition.  Unless these concessions are made promptly the blame for any failure to reap the benefits of this laborious enterprise will not only be lost to the people of this city and the states represented here, but to the railroads which are interested with them in their feature prosperity and development.</p>

                            <head type="sub">He Gets Into the Grounds by Climbing Over the Turnstiles.</head>
                            <p>Building Inspector Butler was induced to indulge in a display of Captain "Bob" Evans' diction this morning as consequence of a message he received from Exposition Director Kirkendall that his shape would be found reclining in a cell in the city <choice><sic>bastile</sic><corr>bastille</corr></choice> if he did not cease from his undignified method of securing admission into the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>Butler is having the same trouble with Manager Kirkendall that City Electrician Schurig had.  He holds that he is responsible for the condition of the buildings on the exposition grounds, as in any other part of the city, and particularly that it is his duty to supervise the erection of buildings on the Midway, for which permits are daily being issued.  In order to perform these duties the building inspector applied for a pass and was turned down.  That has not deterred him, however, and daily he gains admission into the grounds by scrambling over the tops of the turnstiles.</p>
                            <p>When this report reached Director Kirkendall's ears he telephoned the office of the building inspector that he would be arrested if he essayed a repetition of the valuing act.  When this message was delivered to the building inspector he declared forthwith with emphasis that he proposed to go in the same way as in the past unless he is provided with a pass and dared the director to arrest him.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Bluff Tract Is Being Made Fresher and More Beautiful Than Ever.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Blackfeet and Assinniboine Indians Arrive---Concert Opening Auditorium Organ--Notes of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Notwithstanding all that has been said about the beauty, from a landscape standpoint, of the Bluff tract of the exposition, it is likely that a great many people will be surprised today to observe what a pretty picture there is there.  For this is the part of the grounds that will be the scene of the Flower day parade, and consequently more people than usual will be in this part of the grounds.  Indeed, everybody who goes in through the gates is expected to be there when the Flower day procession moves, which will be at 6:30 o'clock in the evening.  And an exceptionally big crowd, it is presumed, will go through the gates, so that the Bluff tract will contain an enormous throng.</p>
                            <p>It was the original intention that the procession should move around the Midway, but many of the teams are to be driven by ladies, and it was though that they might have some trouble in handling their steeds amid the hubbub and the tomtom of the Midway.  It was therefore decided that the parade should be entirely in the quiet precincts, shadowed by the graceful trees and state buildings and brilliant with mammoth beds of blooming flowers of the Bluff tract, and the procession will complete the rounds of the main walks there three times.</p>
                            <p>The tract is being prepared for the occasion.  Lawn mowers and sprinklers were going all day yesterday.  Attendants have been moving in and out among the flowers, plucking off the faded ones and the whole place will look fresher and prettier <choice><sic>that</sic><corr>than</corr></choice> ever today.</p>
                            <p>There remains but one unsightly feature.  This is the bricks and sand hauled for putting a bottom in the pond containing the aquatic plants.  There seems a delay about this work and a hesitation about doing it after all, but nobody wants the bricks and the sand pits there today, and a request has been sent to the proper authorities that they by moved, so that nothing may mar the beauty of the immense flower garden in which the flower festival is to be given.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles announces that three prizes will be awarded, the judges being the mayors of Lincoln, Council Bluffs and Omaha, who will view the pageant from the band stand.  The firs prize will be a gold medal and a banner, the second prize a bronze medal and a banner and the third prize a silver medal and a banner.  The awards are for the best decorated carriage and the second and third best respectively.</p>
                            <p>The Indian congress colony on the exposition grounds was increased this morning by the arrival of a delegation of twenty-two Blackfeet Indians from Browning, Mont., and of twenty-five Assinniboines from Fort Peck., Mont.  The former were under the charge of Interpreter George Pablo, and the latter under the charge of Dan Martin.  They came in at the Burlington depot and were taken to the grounds in street cars.  There they squatted about under the trees, met the Brules already there and smoked the pipe of peace with them, and met Captain Mercer who is in charge of the congress.  The captain told them through their interpreters that he was glad to see them and that an effort would be made to give them a good time.</p>
                            <p>It has been decided the Indians parade on Indian day, next Thursday, shall <choice><sic>beat</sic><corr>be at</corr></choice> 1:30 p. m., instead of 10 a. m.  The change is made on the request of many of the people of the city, who say that they want to witness the open- of the Indian congress, but that their business will not allow them to get away so early in the morning as 10 o'clock.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The most noticeable thing on the exposition grounds yesterday was the official smile.  It was broad enough to be termed a grin, but the gold and silver badged officials are too dignified to indulge in any such luxury.  It was all due to the manner in which Manager Rosewater had sought to take the public into his confidence through the columns of his paper and explain his latest lay-down, due to the calling of his latest bluff.</p>
                            <p>It will be remembered that he "served notice" at the meeting of the board of directors on Friday that he would no longer attend to the press passes because he was directed to send passes to Editor Hudspeth of the Labor Bulletin after he had said be wouldn't do it.  He held off all day Saturday until he learned that a special meeting of the board of directors was to be called for the sole purpose of making him either fish or cut bait, when he hustled before the executive committee and promised to be good.  He later modified his concession so that he would "consent" to act until the next meeting of the board, at which the obnoxious instructions must be rescinded.</p>
                            <p>But what caused yesterday's smile was the following story, printed in Mr. Rosewater's paper, showing how impossible it was for the exposition to get along with the press pass question without Mr. Rosewater's assistance:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">THE MARTYR'S SPIEL.</head>
                            <p>"Since Friday afternoon, when Manager Rosewater of the department of publicity declined to longer perform the thankless task of dispenser of press passes subject to the interference of the board of directors, certain other exposition officials have been acquiring some practical experience of the difficulties of the position.  Saturday <choice><sic>morninf</sic><corr>morning</corr></choice> Mr. Rosewater referred all applications for passes to President Wattles, with the statement that he would have nothing more to do with them, and long before the end of the day President Wattles, with the statement that he would have nothing more to do with them, and long before the end of the day President Wattles had some decidedly enlarged ideas in regard to the pass business  He discovered that it meant a continual inundation of applications, among which there were many that presented perplexing questions that it was impossible to satisfactorily adjust.</p>
                            <p>"One day of it was enough and Saturday night Mr. Rosewater was vigorously urged to take the matter on his own shoulders again.  President Wattles declared that the pass business had occupied his entire time all day and it was absolutely impossible for him to think of carrying such a burden.  Mr. Rosewater replied that it had also been taking his time, which is as valuable as anyone's.  He has given a large portion of his time to this single matter with a view to keeping it on a business basis, but he does not propose to continue to do so unless he is allowed to act without interference.  He said he would not reassume the responsibility unless the action of the board of directors in granting passes was rescinded."</p>
                            <p>What especially tickled the officials was the knowledge of their experience in acquiring "decidedly enlarged ideas in regard to the pass business."  The "continued inundation of applications" was represented by six letters which Mr. Rosewater sent to President Wattles and eleven to the bureau of admissions.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">AN AWFUL BURDEN.</head>
                            <p>While President Wattles was "sweating" under the manifold terrors of his six letters the bureau of admissions was "overwhelmed" with its eleven applications "from every part of the United States."  While the bureau's office boy was unraveling several yards of the "tangled propositions," the bureau itself was tied in a hard knot over the "perplexing propositions that it was impossible to satisfactorily adjust."  Long before nightfall the able-bodied president and the five strong men who help Mr. Rosewater to act as the executive committee were in despair.  Seventeen applications for passes in one day was something that the inexperienced officials had "never dreamed of," and they knew that "one day of it was enough" without even taking a vote on the question.  Before couriers could be dispatched in all directions to look for Mr. Rosewater and bring him in by force to compel him to "reassume the responsibility" that indispensable gentleman fortunately appeared, and was at once "vigorously urged" to take the "burden" and the seventeen letters once more upon his broad and capable shoulders.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ROSY LIFTS THE LOAD.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater would not have been Mr. Rosewater had he refused to be moved by the heart-rending pleas in the face of such a blood-curdling situation, when six stalwart men, abject in their pitiful helplessness, were being ground into the very dust after a hopeless struggle with seventeen letters, each one of which seared their souls with a black and white request for a press pass.  Mr. Rosewater "consented," and president and bureau of admission and the minority of the executive committee <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>President Wattles was on the grounds yesterday, but with the drying of his cuticle and the disappearance of the "sweat" he had forgotten the nightmare of the six letters, and when a Bee reader solicitously inquired about his health he winked profoundly and laughed as if he had never known the agony of receiving half a dozen requests for press passes in a single day.</p>
                            <p>Manager Lindsey, however,  was not so forgetful, and as he recalled the anguish and suffering he had undergone because of those eleven letters "from all parts of the United States" he uncovered his head and displayed dozens of snow white hairs.</p>
                            <p>But the blow is liable to fall again.  The respite lasts only until Friday, when the action of the directors in granting passes must be rescinded and the manager of the department of promotion and publicity must be allowed henceforth "to act without interference," or Mr. Rosewater will kick out the only prop on which the imposing structure has been reared, and the exposition will ignominiously die the death.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the gruesome outlook the directors and other officials on the grounds yesterday were inclined to have a good time in life because they will be a long time dead, and in sheer recklessness of spirits they laughed and laughed.</p>

                            <p>The third wedding among Midway people took place yesterday afternoon.  Pat Fuller and Miss Ethel Bowe, employed at Pabst on the Midway, were the contracting parties.  They came here from St. Louis early in June, and since that time they have been employed at Pabst.  This happy marriage was the culmination of a very romantic love affair, and last night they were receiving congratulations from their many friends.</p>
                            <p>There was a large attendance at the meeting of the Concessionaires' association at Pabst on the Midway yesterday afternoon.  The body remained in session for more than two hours, and much business was transacted, most of which was of a private nature.  The concessionaires are making every effort to induce the exposition directors to give a 25-cent rate at night and on Sundays.  They argue that the experiments at different times have proven beyond question that a 25-cent rate should prevail.  The rate tomorrow night will be 25 cents, and the concessionaires are making arrangements to advertise it extensively.</p>
                            <p>The 15,000 bags of confetti ordered for the great battle to take place in the Streets of All Nations tonight have arrived.  Many orders for confetti at the Streets of All Nations have been received, and at the present rate there will be none left at 11 o'clock tonight.  The battle will begin at 8:30 and will last as long as there is any confetti to be had.</p>
                            <p>Heaven and Hell is rapidly assuming shape, and gives promise of being a wonder in its way.  The Cabaret de la Morte, Dante's Inferno and catacombs are being constructed really underground and terminating in the beautiful Blue Grotto theater.  The scheme contemplates a grand electrical and spectacular effect, contrasting Dore's hell with the magnificent splendor of Milton's paradise.  The Cabaret de la Morte will be larger and more magnificent than the one operated in Paris, which created such a sensation throughout the whole world.</p>
                            <p>The life saving crew had a preliminary drill yesterday, during which the shot was tried over the mast in its new place.  The crew is now ready to give an exhibition as soon as the boat sent for arrives.  It is thought this will be in a day or two.</p>
                            <p>Last night's rendition of the "From Battlefield to Fireside" program was the most successful yet experienced, and the unusually large audience was aroused to a high pitch of enthusiasm.  At the conclusion of the second part, just as the music and fireworks died away, the watching and listening thousands broke into a succession of cheers which continued for some time.  Two surprises were on the evening's card.  One was the unveiling of a life size figure of Bismarck, with a background of draped American and German flags, the band playing "Die Wacht am Rhine" in memoriam.  The other special feature was the introduction on the bandstand of a party of thirty Sioux and Navajo Indians in full paint and war bonnets to make the rendition of the "Indian War Dance" more realistic.  The redskins whooped and howled in so bloodcurdling a manner as to make some of the members of the band decidedly uneasy as the war clubs and hatchets were swung over their heads.</p>

                            <p>Adolf Edgren, the composer, tenor and conductor, and C. A. Jacobson, basso, left last night via Burlington &amp; Missouri for Kansas City.  The object of the trip is to stir up people interested in the Kansas City day, next Saturday, at the exposition.  They carry with them letters of introduction to the mayor and Missouri and Kansas representatives of the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Complete returns on the admissions for July make the following showing, as compared with June:</p>
                            <p>Paid admissions in June, 166,882; in July, 187,654; increase of second month over first, 20,772, or nearly 12½ per cent.</p>
                            <p>Free admissions in June, 122,469; in July, 144,030; increase of second month over first, 21,561, or 17½ per cent.</p>
                            <p>Cash received at the gates for admissions in June, $70,766.85; in July, $79,965.80; increase of second month over first, $9,189.95, or nearly 13 per cent.</p>
                            <p>The apparent increase in free admissions is not actual, as none of the admissions of nearly 1,000 employes in the buildings and grounds department during the first ten days of June were recorded, while none of the small army of concessionaires and exhibitors' employes, as well as exposition employes used the Manderson street gates, were recorded until an even later date, as the turnstiles and chopper boxes were not put in place at those points until the exposition had been in operation about a month.  While it is impossible to tell accurately what those unrecorded admissions numbered, logical computation based on the best information obtainable shows an actual decrease of about 7 per cent in free admissions for July as compared with June.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PASSES ISSUED.</head>
                            <p>The series A passes are those issued to the directors, heads of departments, members of the various state commissions, president of the United States, governors of states and other "big guns" whom it was deemed proper to honor.</p>
                            <p>The series B passes were short term cards, issued principally on the recommendation of Manager Babcock to railroad officials, passenger agents, etc., also to members of the bands that have been playing here, musicians of various classes on requisition of Manager Lindsey, and to visiting architects on requisition of Manager Kirkendall.  It will be observed that of the 1,104 issued but eighty-three were in effect on July 30.</p>
                            <p>The series C passes were all press passes and were issued on the requisition of Manager Rosewater.  Most of them were term passes, and of the 5,732 issued there were but 2,061 in effect on July 30.  As most of these were July passes there are probably less than half of even this number now in effect.</p>
                            <p>The E and F series are all photograph passes.  The E series was issued to exhibitors and concessionaires themselves, and the F series to their employes.  The former was paid for at the rate of $2.50 each, and the latter at $2 each.  The exposition received pay for them all except where payment was expressly waived, as in the case of the members of the fire <choice><sic>dpartment</sic><corr>department</corr></choice>, city detectives, etc.</p>
                            <p>These classes also include the attaches of state buildings and the guards, gatemen and other regular employes of the exposition.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">THREE THOUSAND USED.</head>
                            <p>It will be observed that of these passes 4,127 were issued and 3,446 are in effect.  A few days ago, before the figures were available, the World-Herald approximated this number at 3,500.  Those cancelled for cause represent discharged employes of the exposition, and of exhibitors and concessionaires.</p>
                            <p>Inasmuch as all these people are regularly employed on the exposition grounds, and less than 300 people use sleeping permits to remain on the grounds nightly, it is evident that more than 3,000 passes are daily used in securing admission to the grounds by the class made up of exposition employes, exhibitors and concessionaires and their employes.  This presupposes a single admission to each, but the fact is that many of these parties live or board near the exposition grounds and go outside to their meals. Just how many passes are used twice or more daily cannot be told until a checking of this branch of admissions is completed, but it is certain that 1,000 admissions daily are due to second or third visits.  The gatekeepers at the gates most used for this purpose state positively that the number is much greater than that.</p>
                            <p>That no wholesale imposition has been practiced in the matter of trip passes is very conclusively shown by the fact that thus far but 5,800 of these <choice><sic>passess</sic><corr>passes</corr></choice> have been given out by the bureau of admissions to the president and members of the executive committee for distribution.  This would allow less than 100 per day since the exposition has been open, even if all of them had been used.  As a matter of fact, each of the officials named still has some in his possession, while a number of them have been cancelled.  For instance, a large party of turners, or building and loan association delegates, or delegates to the League of Republican clubs are to be admitted to the grounds.  No one knows just how many there will be, and the executive committee orders 400 given out.  Possibly but 200 or 300 are required.  The remainder are turned back to the bureau of admissions and cancelled.  This was the case Sunday, when 100 passes were ordered issued for the North Central Kansas Editorial association, when but about fifty were used.</p>
                            <p>It thus develops that but about 5,000 trip passes have thus far been used.  Of the 5,800 trip passes turned over by the bureau of admissions 2,100 have gone to Mr. Rosewater and the 3,700 to the president and the other five members of the executive committee.  Assuming that all of Mr. Rosewater's 2,000 have been honestly issued, and that every one of the 3,000 issued by the other officials have been fraudulently issued, the exposition would have suffered an imposition to the extent of only fifty a day, instead of "thousands daily," as charged by Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>Sunday's paid admissions numbered 5,736, a cash net gain of about $80 over the preceding Sunday.</p>

                            <p>A paid attendance of nearly 10,000 people on the exposition grounds yesterday showed conclusively what anything like decent railroad rates will do.  The visitors were very largely out-of-town people, who had been induced to come by the special rates offered for Flower day.  They did not see a flower parade, and many were disappointed on that account, but they realized that the management was not responsible for the rain.</p>
                            <p>It was distinctively an exhibit-seeking crowd, as are all the first-trip visitors, the Midway coming second.  For this reason the concessionaires did not do a business commensurate with the size of the crowd.</p>
                            <p>A special music program was given in the evening, to take the place of the postponed parade, the "From Battlefield to Fireside" program of the preceding evening being repeated, together with the pyrotechnic effects.  The war dance number was omitted on account of the threatening weather, although Captain Mercer offered to have his braves present it unless it rained.  The unveiling of the figure of Bismarck was again repeated, the large figure loaned by Manager Turpin of the Moorish Palace for the purpose being placed prominently at the back of the platform on a pedestal.  The light on it was much better than on Monday evening, and the crowd generously applauded in honor of the dead statesman.</p>
                            <p>J. Q. A. Ward, a guard at the government building, died Monday night of appendicitis.  His relatives at Duluth have been notified.</p>
                            <p>W. G. Adams, traveling agent for the Cotton Belt road, is taking in the exposition while on a two weeks' vacation.  He gave the officials some interesting information yesterday regarding the action of the southern roads in granting reduced rates to the Nashville exposition.  There a flat rate of one fare for the round trip was given from the start, and this was succeeded by one of 1 cent a mile for a radius of 150 miles, and supplemented by special rates of 80 per cent for one fare for the round trip.  After looking over the grounds carefully he said that all this exposition lacked was advertising and railroad rates, and that if the latter were granted the roads would see to the advertising themselves.</p>
                            <p>The report of the concessions department for July shows cash receipts of $35,524.66.  The indications are that the month will exceed June all along the line.</p>
                            <p>An effort to ascertain to what extent a pass is used in a single day was made yesterday, and it was found that the holders of 400 photo passes scored 1,128 admissions on Monday, or nearly three each.</p>
                            <p>Another session of the investigating committee was held last evening.  Evidence of corruption is not materializing, but the proof of rank favoritism continues to accumulate.  Two members of the committee gave it out last night that it is a foregone conclusion<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>With few exceptions, the people who took advantage of the low railroad rates to visit the exposition yesterday remained today, and the attendance is exceptionally good for an off day.  The unsurpassed <choice><sic>lovliness</sic><corr>loveliness</corr></choice> of the morning brought the visitors out early, and the delightful atmosphere inspired the limit of enjoyment.  By the middle of the forenoon the buildings were bustling with visitors, and several thousand people were scattered over the main court and the pretty landscapes on the bluff.</p>
                            <p>This evening the 25-cent admission will again be in force and with the local patronage added to the crowd already on the grounds there is every reason why the evening crowd should be one of the biggest of the season.  The special attraction of the evening will be the illustrated concert on the Plaza.  Pinney's band will render a delightful program and scenic views appropriate to the selections will be furnished by a powerful stereopticon.</p>
                            <p>The tremendous boom in the out of town attendance that was produced by the reduced rates for Flower day encourages the management to expect a big crowd tomorrow, when Indian day will be celebrated by the formal opening of the encampment on the north tract and a parade and public exhibitions of Indian sports and <sic>costums</sic> by 700 red men, representing thirty western tribes.  This will be an entirely new feature in exposition attractions and a revelation to every visitor.  No such exposition of Indian life has ever before been attempted, and it will furnish a limitless field of interest and profit.  It will fully illustrate the differences in dress, manners and appearance between the various tribes and afford a vast amount of interesting information that could not be acquired in any other way.</p>
                            <p>The entire population of the encampment will appear in the parade, which <unclear reason="torn"/>

The cavalcade will pass down the Midway to the Horticulture building and thence back to the encampment, where the rest of the afternoon will be occupied by exhibitions of Indian sports by the various tribes.  All this will be free to the public, and visitors all also be given full liberty to inspect the encampment and see how the primitive red men live.  The camp will be especially interesting in the evening, with its firelight illuminations, and further amusement will be furnished by dances by the Omaha tribe and music by the Indian band.  The fireworks that will occur later will be particularly elaborate.</p>
                            <p>As the floral parade has been postponed to Friday afternoon, each day during the remainder of the week will be a feature.  Arrangements will undoubtedly be secured by which the Indian day excursionists will be permitted to remain over for the flower carnival, and Saturday the Kansas City crowd will arrive in force and remain over Sunday.  Next week will bring another series of special events, and these will succeed one another almost continuously until the end of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">INDIANS OF MANY TRIBES HERE.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Representatives of the Original Lords of the Land Assembling.</head>
                            <p>Although Indian day at the exposition is not to be observed until Thursday, it is the talk of the people who visit the exposition, due, no doubt, to the fact that Captain Mercer is daily receiving and looking after the wants of the delegates who are arriving to participate in the Indian congress, which will continue during the exposition.  The large space west of the Transportation building allotted to the Indians is rapidly becoming a city of tents and everywhere within the enclosure the copper colored men and women, boys and girls, attired in gay blankets, are visible.  They are coming in large parties and it is certain that the captain's estimate of an attendance of 800 will not be far out of the way.</p>
                            <p>Since Monday a large number of Indians have arrived and a still larger number will arrive today and tonight, while others will continue to come in during the balance of the week.  Yesterday the Cheyenne River Sioux came, bringing eight people, and went into camp on the south side of the grounds near the Brule Sioux.  They are fine specimens and present a striking appearance  Being wealthy Indians, they wear fine apparel that is intended to throw in the shade some of the garments owned by other tribes  Frank Taylor is the interpreter and is a perfect fund of information when it comes down to telling hair-raising tales of life among the Indians.</p>
                            <p>The Arapahoes and Cheyennes from Oklahoma have come in.  They number twenty-five persons and are large and strong people, especially the men.  These Indians are farmers and cultivate large tracts of land upon their reservation.  Many of them speak the English language quite well.</p>
                            <p>The Indians that attract considerable attention are the Apaches from San Carlos Agency, Ariz.  They are smaller than the northern Indians, but what they lack in stature they make up in activity.  They are strong and wiry fellows, being as quick as cats.  Their blankets are the envy of the whites who visit the camp.  Made of the finest wool and woven by hand, they are as soft as silk and as thick as a board.  The coloring is artistic and gaudy, red prevailing.</p>
                            <p>There are two delegations of Chippewas on the grounds, one party coming from the Lac lu Flambeau and the other from the Bad River agency, both in Wisconsin.  They are wood Indians and are skilled in boating and boat building.  These are the people who will construct the birch bark canoes and use them for racing purposes on the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The Brule Sioux from Lower Brule Agency, S. D., have come with five people.  They are camped in the neighborhood of their cousins, the Rosebuds and the Cheyennes.  Like them, they are strong, hearty fellows and make a fine appearance.</p>
                            <p>Coming from near by the Sacs and Foxes of Tama City, Ia., are sought after by most of these visitors.  While these Indians are probably more aboriginal than many of the others they are good friends of the whites and have been for a great many years.  The history of the tribe has been handed down from generation to generation, it being said that the Foxes were the chosen of the Great Spirit, at least that is the Fox version.  They say that many many years before the white man landed on the American shores they were a great nation, the warriors being as numerous as the leaves of the forest, their domain extending from the sea well over toward the Great Lakes.  They were brave and as a result they engaged in way and while often victorious they lost large numbers of their young men.  On account of their cunning and their fleetness they say that the Great Father gave them the name that they still retain.  The Sacs, as laid down by Indian tradition, occupied the lands in the vicinity of the mouth of the Mississippi river, but eventually moved north and later on became involved in war with the whites.  They were under the great Indian leader and councilman, Chief Blackhawk, and after the war that bears his name formed a union that has been retained until this day.  They regard Blackhawk as the greatest leader who ever lived.  After the Blackhawk war the men and women of the two tribes married and intermarried.  They quit the war path and became tillers of the soil, the main body of the tribe being removed to Indian territory, but the ones now here were located upon the reservation which they now occupy in Iowa.  From a powerful tribe they have gradually dwindled down until the numerical strength of the tribe is now but about 400, including men women and children.</p>
                            <p>The branch of the Sacs and Foxes, known as Musquakies, are camped just to the east of the office buildings and instead of living in tents, as do the other Indians, occupy wickiups.  These dwellings are constructed of willow poles and mats.  The poles are placed in the ground in the form of a square and the tops tied together, forming a framework about fourteen feet square and eight feet high.  Over these are spread thick and highly colored mats, constructed by the Indians from the rushes that grow in the swamps and lowlands.  The material is woven by hand and shows a high degree of skill.  The Sacs and Foxes are artists and as evidence of this it is only necessary to see some of their beadwork which is upon their fancy blankets, their leggings and bonnets.  The beads are sewed on with sinews and are arranged in perfect square and geometrical figures.  The Sacs and Foxes are small Indians, but unusually well built.  They are straight as arrows, <choice><sic>bread-shouldered</sic><corr>broad-shouldered</corr></choice> and very strong.  They have unusually small feet and hands, of which they feel very proud.</p>
                            <p>The interpreter in charge of the Sacs and Foxes is a man with a history.  His name is Joseph Tosson, now near 60 years of age, but as supple as a boy of 15.  At the time of the war of the rebellion he enlisted in the Second Nebraska regiment of volunteers and served with distinction for three years.  He is a member of the Grand Army post at Tama City and is regarded as one of the best and most influential members.  He has lived with the Indians all of his life and is rich, owning a large tract of land, many cattle and horses and a good sized bank account.  He has raised a family of six children, all of whom have died, with the exception of one son, who is now in school at Lawrence, Kan.  Mr. Tosson feels very proud of this boy and will do everything in his power to give him a finished education.  Joseph Tosson's father was a full-blooded Indian and always a warm friend of the whites.  He died last spring at the age of 95 years.  The elder Tosson was a scout under General Harney during his campaigns against the Sioux when they raided the early settlers of Nebraska.  On account of his bravery he was given a medal by the government, which Mr. Tosson now has in his possession.</p>

                            <p>In the absence of the floral parade the special concert that was hastily improvised for the entertainment of the exposition crowd last night did much to reconcile the people who had come expecting to see a more unusual spectacle.  The Plaza was packed with one of the biggest audiences that has congregated there since the exposition opened, and in spite of the disagreeable atmosphere the people seemed to thoroughly enjoy the performance.  This included several of the features that have previously proved most popular, and as they were entirely new to the bulk of the crowd they took it with all the zest of a first presentation.  The descriptive fantasie, "From Battlefield to Fireside," evoked hearty demonstrations, and as a partial compensation for the postponement of the parade, the pyrotechnical finale was somewhat more elaborate than usual.</p>
                            <p>The Exposition orchestra and Phinney's band contributed a very enjoyable first part, which included a number of popular selections, and the wax figure of Bismarck was unveiled as an accompaniment to the solemn strains of Chopin's funeral march.  Bellstedt's descriptive composition, "The Indian War Dance," was also repeated and every feature was vigorously applauded.  After the concert the bulk of the crowd left the grounds, but enough remained to keep the Midway lively during the remainder of the evening.</p>

                            <p>The Manufacturers' association of Kansas City has unanimously voted to attend the exposition in a body Saturday.  The organization took this action at one of the latest and most lively meetings it has held this year and the members exhibited a degree of enthusiasm in the idea that was exceptional.  A number of vigorous speeches were made, urging a demonstration that would open the eyes of the other exposition visitors and a number of suggestions were made contemplating a novel display that would make the association a conspicuous feature of the Kansas City crowd.  These were finally referred to a special committee which will work out a detailed plan.  An invitation was also extended to the Commercial club of Independence to join with the association in the Kansas City day celebration and it is thought that it will be accepted.  It is announced that the official Kansas City badge will be a flag over a ribbon bearing the words, "Kansas City day, August 6, 1898."</p>
                            <p>In this connection the Kansas City people comment very favorably on the readiness with which the exposition and Omaha city officials have entered into the plans for their reception and entertainment and promise to show them a hot time in return.</p>

The tickets will be good from September 16 to 19.  For the meeting of the National Dental association August 25 to September 3, the rate will be one fare for the round trip in the 150-mile limit, and one fare, plus $2, from outside points.  These tickets extend from August 23 to September 5.</p>
                            <p>The railroads have made an additional concession in regard to the rates for Labor day and the Firemen's tournament, covering September 2 to 7.  The flat rate of 1 cent a mile will apply for the benefit of parties of fifteen instead of twenty, as previously announced.  For individuals the rate remains 1 cent a mile inside a 350-mile limit and one fare for the round trip from outside points.</p>
                            <p>The Central Passenger association has announced rates for Commercial Traveler's day, September 24, and the Sons of Veteran's encampment, September 12 to 16, of one fare plus $4 for the round trip.  This applies east of Chicago.</p>

Mr. Harrison Wild, organist and director of the Grace Episcopal church choir of Chicago, director of the Mendelssohn club of male voices and the newly elected director of the Apollo club in the place of Mr. William Tomlins, is to give the opening concert.  Mr. Tomlins, having resigned in order to enter the lecture field, his place was a difficult one to fill, and Mr. Wild has been chosen as his successor, owing to his ability as shown with the Mendelssohn club and to his success in conducting rehearsals of the Apollo club during the absence of Mr. Tomlins from the city.  Mr. Harrison Wild is recognized as the leading organist of Chicago.</p>

                            <p>Although the public is not generally admitted yet to the camping grounds of the Indians at the exposition, the rules forbidding the entrance of visitors has not been rigidly enforced, and this has already become the favorite part of the grounds.</p>

                            <p>About the middle of the forenoon almost everybody on the grounds was attracted to the south side, where the Indian band from the Flamdreau Indian school, South Dakota, was entering.  It was playing a stirring piece, and the hundreds of Indians in all sorts of costumes standing about made a picturesque scene.  Only part of the band, however, arrived at that time.  About half the members got left at Sioux City, and will be in later.  The members of the band here are Charles S.

                            <div3>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Iowa exposition commission was in session all day yesterday at the Iowa building, and will probably be today.  All the members are present.  These are President S. H. Mallory, S. B. Packard, S. D. Cook, R. H. Moore and J. E. E. Markley.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Commissioner Lambe of Kansas came in yesterday morning, and will be here for some time.  He says that efforts are being made to make Kansas day, August 23, a great occasion.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Commissioner Greene, who is in charge of the Georgia exhibit in the Georgia building, says that Governor Northen has notified him that he is collecting more exhibits, and will have them here in a short time.  It is supposed that they will probably consist of this season's fruits.</p>
                            <p>The Georgia <choice><sic>biulding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice> is now full from top to bottom, the agricultural display, which occupies all of the second floor, having recently been installed.  Naturally, cotton is given prominence in this exhibit, and a large plant of cotton just ready for the picking has the place of honor in the center.  Cotton seed oil in all its stages, from the crudest to the white oil, is shown, and the refuse from the cotton seed used in feeding stock is displayed.  In addition to this there is a good showing of all the common grains, both in the straw and sack, and the different kinds of forage and hay plants are exhibited in the bale.</p>
                            <p>An interesting corner is that in which the kaolin, a white clay from which chinaware is made, is displayed.  Most of the kaolin at the present time is shipped to northern factories to be made up, and Mr. Greene believes there is a good opening for a pottery in Hancock county, where this clay is found.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Colorado educational exhibit is very attractively arranged in the southwest corner of the Liberal Arts building, second floor.  It appears to have been mainly contributed by the Grand Junction schools, but the photographs of the state university at Boulder and of the other colleges in the state give one a splendid impression of the provisions made for higher education in Colorado, and an interesting feature is the showing made of the Sloyd system in the Greeley state normal and at Pueblo.</p>
                            <p>The entire booth is dressed in the colors of the state flower, the columbine.  A gratifying point about the display from Grand Junction is that the work of all the pupils, from the lowest to the highest, is shown, and for the most part only average work has been selected.  It is noticeable that nature work extends through all the grades, the youngest pupils being trained to make observations.</p>
                            <p>Another interesting feature is that showing the system of correlations, such as the correlation of history with geography, of nature with arithmetic, etc.</p>
                            <p>The charts show the large scope in German and Latin in advanced work, and throughout the whole exhibit full development in any one branch can be noted.</p>

                            <p>A woman left her cape and purse on a seat at the building of Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. Tuesday, not missing them until she had reached the Government building.  She was so gratified at the return of them that she gave away to tears as she pressed the manager to accept pay for his kindness.  Recovering her composure, she said: "Every soul in my neighborhood shall know and respect Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., the great mail order house, for this."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Visitors to the Old Plantation yesterday had an interesting experience other than the usual entertainment.  Big Snake, Black Craw, A-Man-Afraid-of-a-Horse, with a party of squaws, visited the show in order to compare their snake dance with the negro buck-and-wing dance.  The Indians were so much pleased with the entertainment that it was difficult to get them to leave the Old Plantation at the close of the entertainment.  On their return to the wigwams they gave such glowing accounts to the tribes encamped there that the day following the Old Plantation had the appearance of an Indian village, so large was the number of Indians.</p>
                            <p>There has been such profound friendship established that the Indians have insisted that the chief invite the Old Plantation darkies to take breakfast in the wigwams and smoke the old-time calumet as they once did when they took the scalp of the white man and black man alike.  Mr. Millicon, in charge of the negroes at the Old Plantation, will entertain the braves at an early breakfast and then the negro and Indian will vie with each other in their peculiar and interesting dances.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the postponement of the flower parade, the great battle of Confetti announced to take place at the Streets of All Nations Tuesday night was also postponed, as so many of those who are to participate in the parade expressed their intention to join in the battle of Confetti.  Hundreds of people who had heard that a battle of Confetti would take place flocked to the Streets of All Nations to witness and to take part.  They were disappointed to some extent, but they were greatly pleased with the performance in the Streets and in the theater.  The battle will take place tomorrow night, and will continue until midnight.</p>

                            <head type="sub">VIEWING THE MAINE.</head>
                            <p>It is an interesting experience when a big crowd is on the grounds to stand near the draped model of the battleship Maine in the navy section of the Government building and watch the people who gather to view that exhibit.  They frequently stand five or six deep.  Sometimes men swear audibly to give vent to their feelings while women relieve their pent-up emotions in tears.  Nowhere else on the grounds is such intensity of feeling manifested, and the situation does not change as the days go by.</p>
                            <p>Special efforts will be made to please the Indians with the fireworks display that is to be made tonight.  The principal figure in fire will be that of an Indian chief on horseback, with the horse in motion.  A number of comic features will be introduced to test the Indians' sense of humor.</p>
                            <p>An interesting feature in the Mines and Mining building is a silver and gold table in the New Mexico exhibit, made by the precious metal workers in Santa Fe.  It is about fifteen inches square, the top of filigree silver work, and the legs of gold.  It cost $4,000.  Wrought in silver on the top is the territorial seal, and the box underneath shows a number of scenes etched in silver.  A number of designs are also wrought on the top, and set out with garnets, rubies and intricate work in solid gold.  At the bottom is a silver basket filled with silver fruit.</p>
                            <p>Another big crowd filled the Grand Plaza last evening to take in a popular concert and the other features at the popular evening price.  The reduced evening rate did not hurt the day attendance, as the admissions prior to 7 o'clock were larger than they have averaged for several days, counting out Flower day and its crowd from out of the city.</p>

                            <p>The concert included the war dance number, and the Indians were again introduced on the platform.  The novelty, however, was the illustrated feature by means of a stereopticon, which threw pictures on a large screen dropped over the band stand arch.  While the band, which was stationed in the soda pavilion, played "Life On the Ocean Wave," cuts of our battleships were shown, and to cover the imaginary transition to Cuban scenes the strains of "The Girl I Left Behind Me" filled the Plaza.  The picture of Washington introduced "America," the American and Cuban emblems brought out "Rally 'Round the Flag," and so on through the program, which had been carefully prepared.  The new feature was so well received that it will be enlarged upon and repeated.</p>

                            <dateline>THE WORLD-HERALD: OMAHA, THURSDAY, AUGUST 4, 1898</dateline>
                            <head type="sub">REDUCE THE NIGHT RATE</head>
                            <p>The World-Herald has been slow to reach the conclusion that the exposition would be benefited by a reduction of the night rate to 25 cents.</p>
                            <p>We have been impressed by the strenuous opposition of the executive committee.  The arguments against reduction have received, as they deserved, great consideration.  The fact was recognized that if the night rates were reduced they could not be again raised.  The claim was forcibly made that gate receipts, being the main assets, should not be hastily tampered with.</p>
                            <p>Now, however, the time has come, the World-Herald believes, to end the discussion and permanently adopt a 25 cent night rate.</p>
                            <p>With a 50 cent night rate, the night attendance has been comparatively small, except on special occasions.  That is to say, the number of persons who enter the grounds after 6 p. m. is small.</p>
                            <p>Whenever we have had a 25 cent night rate the attendance has been large.  This large night attendance on 25 cent nights has not detracted from the day attendance of the same days.</p>
                            <p>A person desiring to see the exposition as a whole cannot do so at night, because the government building is closed and many exhibits are covered up.  Therefore there is no danger that people will stay away during the day so as to save 25 cents by a night visit.</p>
                            <p>The 25 cent night rate at the Nashville exposition was an acknowledged success.  It brought out the town people night after night, made the exposition lively and attractive when it would otherwise have been dull and lifeless at night and is acknowledged to have saved the exposition from bankruptcy:</p>
                            <p>The 25 cent rate at night and the 50 cent rate for all day is an equitable arrangement for three reasons:</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;Because the all day visitor gets twice as much "exposition" as an evening visitor.</p>
                            <p>Second&#8212;Because the all-day visitor only comes once or twice, while the evening visitor will come repeatedly.</p>
                            <p>Third&#8212;Because the evening attendance is made up of people who work all day and who only use the evening attendance as a recreation.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps the strongest single reason why the 25 cent rate should be put into effect at night is to be found in the fact that the exposition is a silent partner in some thirty odd Midway amusements and other exposition concessions.  Every dollar expended on the Midway by visitors means on an average 20 cents for the exposition treasury.  It is a simple proposition that 8,000 people admitted at the exposition gates will spend as a rule at least twice as much on the Midway as 4,000 people.</p>
                            <p>That 25 cents will more than treble the night attendance is a very moderate estimate.  This implies that the gate receipts at night will be increased, the Midway receipts at night doubled and the exposition rendered more attractive to all-day visitors by reason of the increased liveliness at night.</p>
                            <p>The wise course is to make the night rate 25 cents.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>A fair sample of what the failure of the transportation department to secure adequate railroad rates is costing the exposition is contained in a letter received yesterday from R. G. Murdoch of the firm of R. G. Murdoch &amp; Co. of Chicago.  It expresses appreciation of the kindness of the exposition management in granting them the date of September 24 for National Traveling Men's day, but reaches this emphatic conclusion:</p>
                            <p>"We have had a great deal of discussion, and have finally come to the conclusion that the rate is not sufficiently low to insure enough people to make up a special train, or even two cars, and we have made up our minds to have nothing more to do with it.  Personally, I am very sorry, and I think I express the sentiments of all the other members of our committee when I state that it would have been great pleasure for us to have a delegation at Omaha, and show the people out there that we ap<unclear reason="torn"/>efforts by visiting the expo-<unclear reason="torn"/>those who<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>The matter of railroad rates and advertising having for time being excluded all other official ideas from the minds of the directors, and the talk indulged in by all of them is that something must be done to swell the receipts.  The sentiment in favor of a 25-cent evening rate is growing, in order to stimulate the evening admissions, which have amounted to practically nothing except on the two occasions of reduced rates, when it has been very satisfactory.  But it is realized that if the exposition is to be the success that was hoped, and if the desired end is to be attained, it will only be from publicity in the east and rates from eastern points that will enable easterners to get here.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CANNOT BE BIG SUCCESS.</head>
                            <p>A director sized up the situation yesterday, as follows:</p>
                            <p>"We have put up about $1,000,000 to build the exposition, and it is possible for us to do all the patronizing ourselves so as to pay operating expenses and pay back the stock subscribed.  Then the show would pay out financially, but what would be gained?  We would simply have put up $2,000,000 instead of $1,000,000 to reimburse ourselves.  The idea of this exposition was to develop the Trans-Mississippi country through inducing eastern people and capital to locate in it.  If the exposition is a failure in this respect it will fail of its great object, no matter what the financial statement may show at the close.  We must interest the people of the east, yet up to this time they know nothing about it.  I have recently been to the Atlantic coast, and I know what I am talking about.</p>
                            <p>"We must do something to change this state of affairs, and we can't do it too soon.  We must also have rates that will be an additional inducement to come, instead of being a bar to it.  All that we seem to be able to get in the way of rates is a little concession one day for a few miles west, and the next week a little reduction for a few miles in some other direction.  I am getting disgusted with the situation, and before long I will have to talk right out in meeting, whether it hurts anybody's feelings or not."</p>

                            <p>Secretary Wakefield received a letter yesterday from T. L. Kennedy of the Pennsylvania commission stating that at a recent meeting John W. Woodside had been elected chairman, and the following members of the executive committee: George Knox McCain, Dr. J. C. Johnson, J. D. Baker, Dr. J. R. Bryan, I. O. Nissley, C. S. Overholt and T. L. Kennedy.  It was further stated that special efforts were being made to secure the Liberty bell and several notable relics now in the possession of the state, but that thus far they had not been attended with success.  The sentiment of the state commission is in favor of October 5 for Pennsylvania day.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey is in receipt of a telegram from Powell Clayton, minister to Mexico, stating that the Mexican band would be ready to start today and would be here ready to open its engagement of six weeks on the 9th inst.</p>
                            <p>The Shriners have had September 14 set apart as their day at the exposition, and the Odd Fellows will have their day just a month later.</p>
                            <p>September 1 has been designated as Kansas day, and a big attendance is promised.  The governor will be here with his staff, and will be accompanied by a band from Winfield, Kas.  Missouri day will be on August 30, and elaborate fireworks displays will be made features of both these state days, and Governors Leedy and Stone will be presented in portraits of fire.</p>

                            <p>The attaches of the Government building, as well as all the visitors to that structure, are greatly annoyed by a nuisance that is permitted to exist in the shape of improperly flushed sewers.  Numerous complaints have been made, but the exposition officials have claimed it to be the fault of the city, while the city has insisted that the blame belonged to the exposition.  A flushing of the sewers on the grounds a few days ago abated the nuisance for a short time, and demonstrated where the trouble lies.  Things have come to such a pass that unless the department of buildings and grounds gives the matter proper attention one of the finest exhibits on the grounds will be given a wide berth, as the stench is almost unbearable when the wind blows from certain quarters.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit that is probably attracting the most attention just now is the recently received Whitehead torpedo in the navy section.  The engine of destruction is about fifteen feet long, and is completely equipped, with its warhead in place, although the charge of 110 pounds of gun cotton is omitted for obvious reasons.  The polished steel shell is smeared with grease to prevent rusting, and this, together with the conspicuous sign, is sufficient to keep hands off.  The practice head rests alongside.  Cuts on the wall and the explanations of the attendants convey to visitors much new information as to how these terrible engines are handled.</p>

                            <p>The building of a branch line along the valley of the North Platte river is not the only extension the reorganized Union Pacific Railroad company has in mind.  The Miniature railroad on the exposition grounds is to be double-tracked and an extension of the line northward to the Transportation building is under consideration.  The roadbed of the smallest railroad on earth is now being made over with Sherman gravel from the Sherman gravel pits of Wyoming, and the work of double-tracking will be commenced in a short time.  The through traffic has been found to be so heavy that a second track is needed by the little road in its business.  After the double track has been put down the scenic artists of the company are to paint correct representations of the plains of Nebraska, the hills of Wyoming, the mountains of Colorado and the wilder scenery of Idaho and Utah between the places along the line representing the real thing along the "Overland Route."  New equipment to make up a second train for the "Miniature Limited" has been ordered, and is expected here next week.  The cars are being built by firms in Detroit and St. Louis, and the locomotives will be of the Vanderbilt type from Schenectedy, N. Y.  The repair work will be done at the Omaha shops.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">OPENING OF THE INDIAN CONGRESS.</hi></head>
                            <p>The opening of the Indian congress marks an epoch in the history of the American Indian.  For the first time since the government of the United States has undertaken the management of the Indians, representatives of all the principal tribes have been brought together in one great encampment.</p>
                            <p>In making the appropriation of $40,000 to provide for this unique gathering as part of the government exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition congress was actuated by the desire to afford to the world an object lesson of the progress of the American Indian from the savage state to his present condition.  Incidentally, congress was impelled to favor the plan of exhibiting the aborigines at this time and place because the American Indian, like the American bison, is rapidly passing away, and those who survive will soon lose the characteristics of their full-blooded ancestors.</p>
                            <p>The conception of the Indian congress, like that of the Transmississippi Exposition, originated with The Bee, whose editor, with the aid of Senators Allen and Thurston, Congressman Mercer and other representatives of the transmississippi states, succeeded in enlisting the active interest of the Indian bureau and Secretary of the Interior Bliss in the project and in procuring a congressional appropriation to defray its expenses.  Had it not been for the delay in the passage of the Indian appropriation bill, caused by the pressure of war measures, the Indian congress would have been installed at the opening of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Although the Indian appropriation bill was not passed until the last day of June, the Indian bureau has succeeded in less than five weeks in completing all the arrangements for the selection of tribal representatives at the different agencies and reservations and for transporting them to Omaha.  The congress, or rather the great Indian encampment, has been placed under the immediate charge of Captain W. A. Mercer of the United States army, whose experience in dealing with Indians, both as an army officer and as an Indian agent, gives him pre-eminent qualifications for the responsible task imposed upon him.</p>
                            <p>The Indian congress does not contemplate merely an encampment of tribal Indians, housed in native habitations and carrying on various native handicrafts, but also periodic Indian festivals, participated in not only by the Indians in attendance, but by additional members brought from the larger reservations for these special occasions.  These Indian festivals, illustrating the religious and social rites of the American Indian, will be not alone interesting as a show feature, but instructive from the educational and scientific standpoint, affording students of ethnology and sociology an opportunity never before presented and never likely to be again within their reach.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Low railroad rates, perfect weather and one of the most novel and interesting spectacles that has ever been witnessed in this country brought a tremendous crowd to the exposition today.  Since early morning the people have been coming in ever-increasing numbers.  The railroads brought thousands of excursionists and during the forenoon they poured into the grounds in continuous streams.  By 9 o'clock the Department of Admissions was compelled to send out an extra detail of ticket sellers and gatekeepers to the street railway entrances and as the local visitors began to figure in the arrivals the turnstiles revolved with a rapidity that promised to approximate the Fourth of July record.  The Street Railway company put on a number of extra trains on the exposition lines and groups of from fifty to 100 people were dropped at the gates every minute.  The rush was most active about 11 o'clock and for some time a crowded train pulled up as fast as one ahead of it was unloaded.  The crowd was particularly <choice><sic>noticable</sic><corr>noticeable</corr></choice> at the Twenty-fourth street gate, but with two months experience the admissions department handled the rush with sufficient <choice><sic>alacity</sic><corr>alacrity</corr></choice> to keep no one waiting.</p>
                            <p>While many of the visitors filed across the grounds to secure an early view of the Indian encampment the crowd was big enough to cover the entire enclosure.  There was a veritable crush in the Government building, and very nearly the same situation prevailed in the other main structures.  Meanwhile the incoming lines from the entrances were well sustained and by 2 o'clock when the parade started Indian day was an unqualified success.</p>
                            <p>During the forenoon a number of the Indians were mounted and paraded through the principal down town streets in all the panoply of fuss and feathers.  It was one of the most unique cavalcades seen on the streets of Omaha in many a day and business was practically suspended while people lined the sidewalks to witness the spectacle.  The Indians rode back to the encampment for dinner and at 2 o'clock they were mobilized on Twentieth street near the West Midway for the demonstration of the day.  The parade was followed by a number of interesting exhibitions of Indian sports and dances and the program will be continued this evening with the addition of a brilliant display of fireworks.</p>

                            <p>The immense number of out-of-town visitors that were brought in this morning also indicates another big crowd tomorrow when the postponed floral pageant will occur.  The Department of Transportation has succeeded in securing the same rate that was in force on Flower day.  There was no time to secure action by the Western Passenger association, but the railroads have consented to take independent action and make a rate of 1 cent a mile in the 150-mile limit and one fare for the round trip from outside points.  As the same rate was granted for Indian day it practically covers the entire week.  In connection with the floral parade Friday afternoon Mrs. Clement Chase, president of the Bureau of Entertainment, and the executive committee announce that the reception in their rooms in the Mines building after the parade will be entirely informal and everyone is cordially invited to attend.</p>
                            <p>The program that will figure in the celebration of Kansas City day Saturday will be somewhat informal, the idea being to merely indulge in enough oratory to make the visitors welcome without interfering with their <unclear reason="covered"/>d their time in seeing the ex-<unclear reason="torn"/> over three lines on as many special trains as may be necessary to carry the crowd.  Mayor Jones and the other city officials will arrive on the Burlington at  8 o'clock in the morning.  They will be met at the depot by the Omaha officials and escorted in carriages to their headquarters at the Millard hotel.  At 10 o'clock they will be taken to the grounds and at 11 the exercises of the day will be held in the Auditorium.  These will consist of an address of welcome by Mayor Moores and responses by ex-Governor Crittenden of Missouri and other members of the visiting party.  Phinney's band will interpolate a number of selections and then the visitors will be turned loose on the grounds.  The visiting city officials will be entertained at lunch by the Omaha officials at 1:30.</p>
                            <p>The unofficial members of the party will come in on the Port Arthur and Missouri Pacific roads during the morning.  They will likewise make their headquarters at the Millard hotel and will participate in the celebration on the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Great Procession Will Move at Four O'clock Friday Afternoon.</head>
                            <p>The postponement of the Flower parade from Tuesday to Friday afternoon, though not intentional and not without regret upon the part of all interested, has really had the effect of doubly insuring the success of the unique pageant.  The additional days gained by the paraders through the postponement have been put to good use in the ornamentation of their vehicles, and a more artistic parade will be seen tomorrow afternoon than could have possibly passed the reviewing stand on Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday about half of the carriages that will appear in the line were carefully inspected by Mrs. Travis.  While she found the plans agreed upon for decoration very well carried out in most instances she discovered many little things that would have marred the beauty of the passing show had they not been corrected before the eventful afternoon.  The wife of a prominent barrister, in her eager desire to completely hide all the usual trappings of her carriage, had covered the tires of the wheels with cloth.  Mrs. Travis called attention to the fact that the cloth would be cut to pieces before the vehicles had gone through the parade, and instead of the tires presenting a fine appearance they would be the circular supports of a bunch of cloth rags.  The cloth covering was removed.  The carriages that were not examined yesterday will be today.</p>
                            <p>Many of the owners of the carriages that will make up the gala procession have invited in their friends during the last two days to look over the results of their handiwork.  The barns and stables where the precious things are kept have been turned into impromptu reception rooms, and more calls have been made there since Monday than in the drawing rooms of the first families.  The verdict of all who have seen the carriages is that they are exquisitely decorated, and arranged in a graceful line curving in and out of the pretty spots on the Bluff tract will present a spectacle unequaled by any of Omaha's previous artistic successes.  The double team of President Gurdon W. Wattles will appropriately lead the procession.  It will be followed by the tallyho of Mr. Al Patrick.  The order in which the carriages will follow is known to no one save Mrs. Travis, and will not be announced before the passing of the wheeled bowers.  The arrangement of the carriages has been made with the finest regard for color combinations, and the most fetching results are anticipated.  The carriages will not be crowded closely together, but a considerable amount of space will be left between them all.  Great attention is being paid to the decoration of the rear ends of the carriages, as well as to their other parts, as the attention of the judges must necessarily be attracted to the back of the carriage longer than to any other part.</p>
                            <p>The parade is to start promptly at 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon, but the carriages are all to be on the exposition grounds at 3 o'clock.  One hour will be none too long for the necessary arrangement of the vehicles and the taking of the photographs.  All of the carriages are to be photographed, and these pictures will undoubtedly form beautiful souvenirs of the fete day.  Should any of the participants in the parade be late in reaching the grounds they will be debarred from the photographic groups.  The pictures will have to be taken before the parade starts, as it will be too dark after the conclusion of the event to secure good photographs.</p>

                            <p>People who have never seen the American Indian in all of his aboriginality are being afforded that opportunity now.  This opportunity is due to the fact that close to 450 Indians are encamped on the north tract of the exposition grounds, just west and <unclear reason="torn"/>t from the Transportation

                            building.  There are more Indians coming and before the end of the week it is probable that there will be fully 800 in attendance upon the congress.</p>
                            <p>While all of the Indians on the exposition grounds do not know Captain Mercer, they all look upon him as the man who stands next to President McKinley, and consequently all of them come to him and pour their joys and troubles into his ears.  The captain is a patient listener and never turns a deaf ear to the appeals and entreaties, no matter how insignificant they may be.  As a result of this he has suddenly bounded into popularity with the Indians from the most remote parts of the country, and those who have not heard of him before.  If an Indian wants a pail of water or a pipeful of tobacco, Captain Mercer must be consulted before an effort is made to secure the same.  While he is not at all times able to the demands made upon his time, he is always pleasant and has some person ready to attend to the wants of the red men who are about him.</p>
                            <p>There is an Indian name for about everything under the sun, and one peculiarity about this whole matter is that if an Indian does not know the name of a person or thing, he immediately coins one.  Outside of the Omahas and Winnebagoes, few of the Indians know Captain Mercer or his name.  For this reason he has been given as many names as there are bands of Indians on the grounds.  The latest name that has been coined and given to him comes from the Jicarilla Apaches, who come from the northern portion of New Mexico.  These people call him Koski Jolik Tytioprt, which it is said when translated into English means He Who Feeds All, though no person seems to know, as there are few who speak the Apache language.  Other names the captain has galore, and by the time that the last band of Indians arrive, he will have enough to fill a dictionary.</p>
                            <p>The Indian camp is growing in size, and the occupants of course continue to be the star attraction on the grounds.  At this time they are all busy, or at least the women are.  The Indian man is a firm believer in the rights of woman.  At least he believes that the woman has a perfect and undisputed right to work while he takes life easy.  The visitor will find the women putting up the tepee, carrying the water, tending the babies and tethering out the ponies, while the men visit back and forth or lie around in the sun or shade as suit them best.</p>
                            <p>It has become apparent since the arrival of the Indians that they are all great visitors and are possessed of a great amount of sociability.  When a new party arrives upon the ground the members are at once surrounded by the other Indians and as a rule what is supposed to be an interesting conversation is carried on, either by words or signs.  There are no introductions and the meeting of the two strange Indians can be likened to the meetings of two gangs of strange boys.  They approach within a distance of twenty or thirty feet, stare at each other and begin to jabber.  Then there is a nearer approach and the parties walk in circles, one around the other.  This continues for a time, during which the Indians are constantly drawing closer together.  Finally they get within handshaking distance, but there is no shaking of hands.  There is a little more talking, after which the always present pipe is brought out and after being lighted is smoked, the party who does the lighting taking the first whiff, after which he passes it to the stranger.  This completes the introduction and is said to cement friendship that is hard to break.</p>
                            <p>Since yesterday Indians have been coming in at a lively rate.  One hundred and forty Omahas and forty Winnebagoes, bringing 100 ponies, have arrived.  The Santees, from Flandreau, S. D., reached the grounds, bringing along a brass band.  Two families of Crow Creek Sioux have reached the grounds, while Jicarilla Apaches from New Mexico have put up their tents.  These latter Indians, though still clad in the blanket, are undoubtedly the most highly civilized of any Indians upon the grounds.  They are farmers and are skilled in the manufacture of pottery and the weaving of blankets.  They live high up in the mountains, where they raise grain, vegetables, sheep and cattle.</p>

                            <head type="sub">OKLAHOMA IS ON DRESS PARADE.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Territory Makes a Splendid Showing of Its Agricultural Resources.</head>
                            <p>Among the prominent men in attendance upon the exposition are Governor C. M. Barnes and J. C. Post of Oklahoma.  The governor is president of the commission and Mr. Post is the chairman.  They arrived yesterday and spent most of their time visiting the main buildings and the state buildings on the bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>Governor Barnes is one of the wealthy men of the territory and is a staunch republican who formerly resided in Arkansas.  He was appointed to the position which he now holds by President McKinley and since taking charge of the office has devoted all <unclear reason="torn"/>o the upbuilding of the ter<unclear reason="torn"/> young man is an ensign and is now assisting in the blockading of Havana harbor.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Post is a banker at Kingfisher.  He went there several years ago and has always been prominently connected with the affairs of the territory.  He is a brother of Former Chief Justice Post of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Governor Barnes is well pleased with the exposition and in speaking of it last night he said:  "It is grand beyond all conception and will go down into history as the greatest exhibition of the resources of the great west that has ever been seen.  The industrial and agricultural exhibits are as fine as the world has ever seen and they are diversified.  There is apparently just enough of everything and not too much of anything.  I knew all along that it was a great show, but I never had any clear conception of its magnitude until I stepped inside the gate and gazed over the grand court, which is magnificent beyond all description.  It is a picture for an artist; it is more beautiful than the World's fair.  Inside the great buildings are the best things that can be gathered from the transmississippi country.  There is nothing shoddy and there seems to have been a studied effort among exhibitors to bring before the public only that which will please.  The exposition has builded well and the greatest care must have been exercised in securing the exhibits.</p>
                            <p>"While the territory that I represent is one of the newest subdivisions of the great country in which we live, I feel considerable satisfaction in realizing that it has an exhibit of which we ought not to feel ashamed.  In making our exhibit we were hampered by lack of funds, but notwithstanding this, our people responded liberally.  The contributions were not made with a desire to boom the country, but merely to enable us to exhibit our resources and show that we can grow and mature every grain, vegetable and fruit that can be produced in any country on earth.  Later on in the season we will add to our exhibit, thus keeping it up to date.  At this time our corn is almost ripe and within a few days we will send on specimens that will astonish the people.  We will exhibit fruit as fine as can be raised in any of the states, either east or west, north or south."</p>
                            <p>The exhibit from Oklahoma, shown in the Agricultural building, and which is under the care and custody of Editor Goloba, is about complete and is greatly admired by those who visit the building.  It occupies a prominent position in the building, being just to the left of the main entrance from the east.  Along the front, high up against the ceiling, there are three pictures upon canvas.  All three represent farm scenes, but the center pieces are the things that catch the eye.  The central piece is the territorial seal, while to the right and left are sheaves of wheat and barley, respectively.  The grain is fully five feet in length, with heads upon the straw measuring fully eight inches.</p>
                            <p>Around the booth has been constructed a railing, the material used being the native wood found in the forests of the territory.  There are pine, cedar, fir, cypress, oak, hickory, beach, birch, walnut and half a dozen other varieties.  For corner pieces bundles of cut corn have been brought into play, the stalks of which are from twelve to sixteen feet high, all heavily eared.  Inside of the booth are great pyramids of grain, including wheat, oats, barley, flax and corn.  These are arranged in an artistic manner, producing a very pleasing effect.  At the base of each <choice><sic>pyrimid</sic><corr>pyramid</corr></choice> there are jars of fruit, rich and juicy, flanked with new vegetables, such as potatoes, beets, sweet potatoes and cabbage, all of enormous size, sound and solid.</p>
                            <p>Cotton is a product in which the people of Oklahoma feel a great interest, and in making up their exhibit they have featured it.  Great bales of the material occupy prominent places in the booth, while stalks in bloom and others with bulbs ready to burst are scattered wherever they will attract the most attention.  The raw cotton has been used for decorating the booth and is wrought into wreaths, stars and garlands which hang from the ceiling and from the posts, pillars and corners.</p>
                            <p>Governor Barnes says that he feels confident that as soon as the harvest is over large numbers of the people from his territory will visit the exposition.  It has been advertised well in that section of the country, and that there is a general desire to come here and attend the greatest exposition since the World's fair.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Business Men Asked to Close Early on Friday&#8212;Children's Rates.</head>
                            <p>For the purpose of making the afternoon of Flower Day a holiday, at the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition, a resolution was adopted, requesting the merchants and business men to close their places of business at 4 o'clock on the afternoon of that day.  As this would be but two hours earlier than the usual time for closing, it is believed that most of them will comply with the request.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock of the Transportation department reported that the Elkhorn had made a Children's Day rate for all children attending the exposition on August 12 from Norfolk and intermediate points on the line.  The rates made are as follows for the round trip:  Norfolk, $1.35; Stanton, $1.35; Pilger, $1.10; Wisner and Beemer, $1; West Point, 85 cents; Scribner and Crowell, 75 cents; Hooper, 65 cents; Nickerson, 55 cents.  The rates will apply to all children of 18 years or under.  While adults are not given the benefit of this low rate, one will be allowed with each ten children and at the same rate.</p>
                            <p>The committee decided that the rate would be satisfactory and that all children from the points on the Elkhorn heretofore named would be passed into the exposition grounds at 15 cents each upon that occasion.  The train will stop at the Twentieth street gate on the north side of the grounds and returning it will leave from the same place.  In order that none of the children may stray away or be lost, tags will be sent to the towns from which the little ones come.  These tags will be tied upon the clothing of the children and upon them will be an inscription indicating the place of their residence.</p>
                            <p>The members of the Pennsylvania commission notified the committee that if it was an open date they would like to have October 5 set aside as Pennsylvania Day.  This will be reported upon at the next meeting.</p>

                            <p>The third grand court concert will be given in the main court this evening.  There has been some complaint that the orchestra and chorus was not heard to the best advantage at the east end of the lagoon, where the melody was confined by the high walls and tonight the music will be transferred to the Mirror, where the water is almost level with the grounds.  The orchestra will be located in one of the angles formed by the extension of the lagoon into the clover leaf design and the chorus will occupy the opposite angle.  By this arrangement the music can be heard distinctly all around the Mirror and the broad sweep of pavement will accommodate an immense crowd without discomfort.</p>
                            <p>The chorus, directed by Thomas J. Kelly, will sing the evening hymn, "Sun of My Soul," and "The Minstrel Boy," by Thomas Moore.  The antiphonal chorus, "Adestes Fideles," which was so well received on its first presentation, will be repeated by the chorus and band and the final number will be a very effective patriotic arrangement.  The band will play the "Star Spangled Banner" and then subside while the chorus takes up the hymn, "America."  Among the band selections will be the "Largo" by Handel, the overture, "Robespierre" and an arrangement of selections from Paderewski.  The cornet solo by Mr. Rodenkirchen will introduce another novel feature.  The soloist will be located in a gondola at the other end of the lagoon.  As the craft is propelled toward the audience the music will increase in volume, producing a very pretty effect.</p>

                            <p>Douglas county is getting to the front in the Horticulture building and is showing an exhibit that in quantity and variety compares very favorably with some of the states.  Superintendent Walker is constantly making additions to the exhibit and says that he will continue to do so until the close of the exposition.  Mr. Walker manufactured 1,000 gallons of grape wine last season and at this time he is showing a number of samples.  His wine cellars are the largest in the state.  His vineyards and orchard are near Florence.</p>
                            <p>Joseph Cole, living just west of Florence, has sent in a great quantity of wild goose plums which are attracting much attention.  E. H. Walker is exhibiting six varieties of new apples, while J. P. Brown of Florence has a number of plates of blackberries that are as fresh as those shown during June.</p>
                            <p>Idaho has contracted for 300 feet of space in the west end of the Horticulture building and will fill it with fruit next week.</p>
                            <p>Colorado's fruit exhibit is slow in arriving, but the promise is made that next week it will arrive and by put in place.</p>
                            <p>Next month New York will fill its space <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>California's new crop of fruit is arriving.  Since the beginning of the week Superintendent Wilson has received an invoice of yellow botan plums, Kelsey Japan plums and Crawford peaches.  The fruit is unusually large and fine.  He says that the quality of the California fruit is excellent this season.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Business Men Say it is Impossible Unless All Act Together and the Time is Too Short for Arrangements.</head>
                            <p>The retail merchants of Omaha do not expect to close Friday afternoon on account of the flower parade at the exposition grounds.  Many knew nothing of the request of the exposition executive committee asking them to close either for the afternoon or at 4 o'clock.  Others say they are there for business and have not helped the fair along in order that they should close their doors on some special day.</p>
                            <p>The Continental Clothing company says it will not close.  Browning, King &amp; Co. say they will close if the others do, but there is little probability of it.  Kilpatrick &amp; Co. will not close.  They had heard nothing of any such request.  Mr. Kilpatrick remarked that if the exposition officials had consulted with the merchants beforehand they undoubtedly would have met with better success and that the merchants would have been glad to close up for the occasion.  The People's Furniture and Carpet company say no.  Mrs. Benson says she will close her store if the others do and that she would be glad to do it.  In case no one else does she can not.  Thompson, Belden &amp; Co. said they do not expect to close.  The Boston store managers say they will remain open until the usual hour.  Hayden Bros. say they would like to close if the other do, but their closing is unlikely.  The Nebraska Clothing company say they will not close and do not see how the exposition officials can expect them to shut their doors on the public at the busiest part of the afternoon.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Trains from the East Are Loaded with People Who Want to See the Show.</head>
                            <p>On former days when large crowds came to the exposition from out of town it has been noticeable that most of the people came from the west.  The crowds arriving in the city this morning, however, have been largely from the east.  The Milwaukee brought in a crowded train from Iowa points; the Rock Island and Northwestern each had larger trains than usual, and they were so full that people had to stand on the platforms; Burlington train No. 5 was almost twice its usual size and brought at least 700 excursionists to the city.  The Omaha line also had a large party of Iowans from Sioux City and intermediate points.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska crowd was not lacking, either, in the morning arrivals.  Burlington train No. 4 brought in fourteen heavily loaded coaches, and in spite of the fact that it had two engines, was delayed about fifteen minutes by the crowds.  The Rock Island and Union Pacific each brought in heavy trains from the west and the Elkhorn and Missouri Pacific had well filled trains from Nebraska points.</p>
                            <p>At the Tenth street depot the people began to arrive early this morning, and by 10 o'clock all the cars bound for the exposition were so jammed that many people had quite a wait before they could even find standing room on a car.  The passenger directors and policemen around the station are kept busy answering questions and the excursionists say that the stream of sightseers who have been pouring into the city for the last few days are but a forerunner of what may be expected from now on to the end of the exposition if the railroads make a good rate.</p>

The rates that have been secured are very low and as the children the expense of the trip will be merely nominal.  The age limit has been fixed at 18 years in order to bring in the pupils of the higher grades and no adult tickets will be sold except to one person for each ten children.  Each group of ten will be in charge of their chaperon from the time they leave home until they get back again and this does away with any suggestion of danger.  The party will be carried on a special train and the occasion will be celebrated by exercises at the Boys' and Girls' building at 2 o'clock.  The program will be contributed by the visitors and each town represented will be expected to furnish a number.</p>

                            <p>The tickets sold by the railroads allowing exposition visitors several days at the exposition are making the crowds steadier and lessening the rush which occurred at the depots when tickets were sold for only one day and good on special trains.  The Indian day crowds remained in the city for the most part and will take in the Flower parade, helping to swell the large attendance that is assured for this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>All the morning excursionists poured into the city from Iowa and Nebraska points.  Most of the arrivals were women and many of them were heard to remark that they were in Omaha Tuesday to see the Flower carnival and that their desire to see it was so great they could not stay away.  Lincoln and intermediate points, the southern part of the state, Fremont, Sioux City and other northern and western Nebraska points contribute to the throng.</p>

                            <p>Nature's repentance for the frowns that necessitated the postponement of Flower day was apparent in the bright skies under which the pageant of color and beauty will move this afternoon.  There was scarcely as big a crowd on the grounds this morning as there was Tuesday, but the bulk of the people did not get away from the show until late last night and preferred to wait until later in the day before they returned to the grounds.  Towards noon the rush was resumed and the people swarmed through the gates at a rate indicative of a big afternoon and evening crowd.  As the great event of the day was not scheduled until late in the afternoon the volume of arrivals was maintained until 3 o'clock when the people massed on the bluff tract to see one of the most beautiful spectacular effects that they had ever witnessed.</p>
                            <p>The crowd that assembled on Flower day in spite of the drizzling rain was a sufficient indication that this novel feature has aroused a lively interest and those who witness the parade today will profit by a number of improvements that the postponement has made possible.  During the last three days number of changes have been made that will add to the artistic harmony of the pageant and it promises to be one of the most complete and attractive spectacles that has ever been seen in Omaha.  There will be nearly fifty vehicles in line, <choice><sic>includling</sic><corr>including</corr></choice> the most elaborate <choice><sic>equippages</sic><corr>equipages</corr></choice> in Omaha, and each will be completely covered with masses of flowers arranged in the most beautiful and unique designs.  Each vehicle will express an original conception worked out in flowers especially suitable to the design, but care has been taken that all shall blend in a perfect harmony of coloring that will entrance the senses with beautiful effects.</p>
                            <p>The vehicles that are to participate in the parade are expected to enter the grounds on the east side of Sherman avenue not later than 3 o'clock and proceed to the open park south of the Horticulture building, where they will be marshaled in their proper places.  The parade will move promptly at 4 o'clock and pass in front of the Nebraska and Illinois buildings to the bandstand, where it will be reviewed by Mayor Moores of Omaha, Mayor Jennings of Council Bluffs and Mayor Graham of Lincoln, who will constitute the committee of judges.  It will return by the West Avenue to the Horticulture building and repeat the circuit twice in order that the crowd as well as the judges may have a full opportunity to inspect the decorations.  Immediately following the parade the women of the Bureau of Entertainment will give an informal reception at the Mines building to which the public is invited.</p>
                            <p>The celebration of Kansas City day tomorrow promises to fittingly conclude the most successful week that the exposition has yet enjoyed.  Every report from the Missouri city indicates that there will be an immense crowd of Kansas City people on the grounds to participate in the jubilation, and as most of the excursionists now in the city will remain until tomorrow night the prospect for a large attendance is encouraging.  The Kansas City visitors will arrive tomorrow morning in special trains over the Burlington, Port Arthur and Missouri Pacific routes.  The city officials will come on the Burlington and will be met at the depot by the Omaha officials and escorted to their headquarters at the Millard hotel.  Some time will be allowed for breakfast and general sociability and the party will leave for the exposition grounds about 10 o'clock.  The exercises of the day will be held in the Auditorium an hour later.  Mayor Moores will welcome the visitors in behalf of the city of Omaha<unclear reason="torn"/>

                            Wattles will extend the felicitations of the exposition association.  Ex-Governor Crittenden of Missouri will respond, and then the visitors will be turned loose over the grounds, with the exception of the officials, who will be entertained at lunch by the Omaha city officials.</p>
                            <p>While there is no set program for the afternoon, a number of the visiting commercial organizations have planned demonstrations that will amuse themselves and interest the crowd.  The excursionists will bring a profusion of bands and there will be music galore all the afternoon and evening.  They will remain in the city over Sunday, and declare their intention to make it a hot town during their stay.</p>

                            <head type="sub">General Longstreet and Party Come to Look Over the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>General James Longstreet, railroad commissioner for the United States, accompanied by his party, arrived in Omaha yesterday noon, in a special car over the Northwestern, on a tour of inspection over the land grant and bond-aided roads.  His car is sidetracked at the exposition grounds, where it will remain till tomorrow morning, when the general will leave for Denver, Salt Lake City and San Francisco, returning east by the southern route.</p>
                            <p>The party is composed of Mrs. Longstreet, Colonel and Mrs. C. C. Sanders, Miss Sanders, and Mrs. Sanders, all of Gainesville, Ga., Mrs. J. H. Hunt and Emory Shannon of Elberton, Ga., and the general assistant, L. W. Haskell of Abbeville, S. C.</p>
                            <p>The general said it had been forty years since his last previous visit to this city.  At that time he was in the regular army, on his way to visit the different Indian agencies in his jurisdiction, and said there was little here then to indicate that a city was in store for the future.  He said he was for three years with General Grant at West Point, being in the class ahead of the hero at Appomattox.</p>
                            <p>The general is 77 years old, but says he is in excellent health, and that he refrained from going to way only to prevent his tramping upon the toes of the enthusiastic younger generation.  He contributed his two sons to the cause, however, one of whom is with Fitzhugh Lee at Jacksonville, and the other at Chickamauga.  He says Fitzhugh Lee served under him during the civil war.</p>
                            <p>General Longstreet served one year as minister at Constantinople during the administration of President Hayes, and says he enjoyed his life there.  It is an interesting city; with delightful climate and good enough for anybody.  When President Garfield came in he was brought home and made United States marshal for the district of Georgia.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Sanders, who is one of the party, is president of a state bank at Gainesville, and served under General Longstreet during the rebellion.  He commended five brigades during one engagement in which he lost 50 per cent of the men under him, none of whom were taken prisoners.</p>
                            <p>The members of the party put in the afternoon visiting the exposition, and all expressed pleasure over the beauty of the spectacle.  The general was particularly enthusiastic in his praises of the enterprise, and says it is a credit to the city and the men who made it.  He was so tired from his afternoon's exertions that he remained in his car last evening while his companions visited the Indians and watched the fireworks.</p>

                            <head type="sub">One Cent Per Mile for Flower Day and Other Occasions.</head>
                            <p>A rate of 1 cent per mile is offered on all railroads leading to Omaha today on account of the Flower parade, which will be the central figure on the exposition program, and railroad men anticipate a large attendance from surrounding town as well as from the three cities about the exposition.  As the Flower parade was postponed until this afternoon from Tuesday there was some delay in securing the reduced rate and but little time has been left to advertise the new date.  Wherever possible the railroads have boomed the attraction and good results are expected.  The rate prevailing is 1 cent a mile from all points within 150 miles of Omaha and from points beyond this radius the rate offered is one regular fare for the round trip.  In addition the tickets sold at reduced rates for Indian day will be good to return on this evening's trains, enabling the holders to remain to witness the unique parade on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>Monday and Tuesday of next week a large party is expected to visit the exposition from St. Paul and Minneapolis.  For this occasion a round trip rate of $14, including hotel expenses and exposition admissions for two days, is offered by the railroads.</p>
                            <p>On Friday, August 12, the children living along the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley railroad are expected to unanimously report at the exposition grounds.  Reduced railroad rates <unclear reason="covered"/> made for children <unclear reason="torn"/> age and an adult with every ten children will be given the advantage of the same rate.  The children will also be admitted to the exposition at the rate of 15 cents per capita.  The round trip rates offered for the children from the principal points in the Elkhorn August 12 are as follows:  Norfolk, $1.35; Stanton, $1.35; Pilger, $1.10; Wisner and Beemer, $1; West Point, 85 cents; Scribner and Crowell, 75 cents; Hooper, 65 cents, and Nickerson, 55 cents.  A special train will be run on this day for the benefit of the children and every attention will be shown them from the time they leave home until they are safely returned.</p>
                            <p>September 17 has been designated as Railroad day.  While it is not anticipated that many of the railroaders will have to pay fare, a rate of 1 cent per mile from points within 150 miles and a rate of one fare for the round trip from points beyond this radius has been made for the benefit of the families and friends of the railroad men.  The tickets will be good from September 17 to 19.  Low rates have also been declared for the meeting of the National Dental association, August 25 to September 3; Labor Day and Firemen's Tournament, September 2 to 7; Commercial Travelers' day, September 24, and Sons of Veterans' Encampment, September 12 to 16.</p>

                            <p>The exhibit in the Horticultural building was visited by more people yesterday than upon any previous day since the opening of the exposition.  This was largely due to the opening of the gate in the rear of the Georgia building and but a few feet distant from the west door of the building in which the great fruit display is made.  Thousands of people left the cars at this point and immediately visited the Horticultural building and state buildings on the Bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>The Horticultural building had been brightened up on the inside and everything presented a very pleasant and attractive appearance.  One of the first visitors to call was Senator Dunlap of Illinois, president of the State Horticultural society, and the man who was in charge of the Illinois fruit exhibit at the World's fair.  Speaking of the fruit exhibit at the exposition he said:  "It is wonderful and never before did I realize that the western states are making such progress in fruit raising.  We always thought that we could beat any state in the union.  After looking through this building I am convinced that there are others and that unless we look to our laurels we may be outclassed.  The west is becoming a great fruit raising district and there is no mistake about it."</p>
                            <p>Senator Dunlap will return home and work up enthusiasm among the Illinois fruit growers and will do much to keep the display in fine condition until the close of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Youngers of the Nebraska exhibit is out scouring the state in the interest of the Nebraska exhibit and while away will see a great many of the growers for the purpose of inducing them to send their fruit on for exhibition.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Nelson of the Missouri exhibit is giving the shelves in his space a coat of fresh paint and is preparing to load them down with fruit.  He has received fifteen evergreens which will be placed in tubs and located in connection with the exhibit.  A large number of varieties of new peaches and pears from Missouri are being exhibited.</p>
                            <p>Kansas is showing a fine lot of new apples, which when added to the display already made furnished the state with a very creditable exhibit.</p>

                            <p>The captured Spanish flag that was recently secured by the War department for the exposition has arrived and is now suspended in President Wattles' office in the Administration Arch.  It is not a large emblem, but it is regarded with more interest than any recent acquisition.  A little over a month ago it was waving over the Spanish ramparts at Juraguasito and now it comes to take the place of the Spanish flag that crept into the international decorations when the exposition opened and was promptly relegated to the sewer in response to a vigorously expressed public sentiment.</p>
                            <p>The flag was captured June 23 by a detail of soldiers from Company B of the Twenty-second infantry.  This is the Fort Crook regiment, and the prize is consequently of more than ordinary local interest.  The men who <choice><sic>particupated</sic><corr>participated</corr></choice> in the capture are Corporals Newman and Boyle and Privates Keyser, Cooley and Houghtaling.</p>

                            <p>Great preparations are being made for Red Men's day, which will be observed next Wednesday, and it is pretty certain that a great crowd will be in attendance.  A committee from the local lodges called upon Captain Mercer yesterday and asked that he allowed his Indians to take part in the parade.  The captain informed the members of the committee that he was willing to co-operate and would do all in his power to make the occasion a success.  It is expected that fully 1,000 Red Men from Omaha and neighboring towns will take part in the exercises.</p>

                            <p>The St. Paul Globe of recent date tells the following on one of the members of Governor Clough's staff:</p>
                            <p>"While the governor and his party were taking in the sights of the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha the other day, one of Mr. Clough's aides drifted away from the Minnesota party long enough to chase into a fake museum on Sixteenth street, where for 10 cents the patrons were regaled with some delectable visions of tawdry chromos and alleged wonders of more or less uncertain value.  The two chief features of the place were a fascinating lecturer and a diligent small boy to take tickets.  After the lecturer had finished showing the party around, he informed the ladies and the minors in sepulchral tones that they were through.  However, the men, if they desired to see 'our special bill,' might remain for an additional charge of 15 cents.  The men stayed, mostly.</p>
                            <p>"'Are you ready, Maud?' shouted the lecturer, metamorphosing into a stage manager with the easy grace of an Omaha Chesterfield.</p>
                            <p>"From the depths of a cavernous curtain came in a feminine voice:  'Not quite.'</p>
                            <p>"The crowd surged closer to the curtain; eyes set forward in their sockets like pigs at their matutinal trough.  In a moment that seemed an eternity to the anxious throng, the curtain was pulled aside.</p>
                            <p>"Maud was ready.  And there was not a wrinkle in her brand new bicycle suit, either, that had not been draped before the stage mirror."</p>

                            <p>The third and probably the last of the series of grand court concerts by the Exposition chorus and Phinney's band was heard with substantial appreciation last night by an audience that packed the entire west half of the main court.  The change to this end of the court proved most acceptable, as the wide sweep of pavement around the mirror offered far more spacious accommodation for the crowd and the music was heard to far better advantage than at the previous locations.  The chorus sang the evening hymn, "Sun of My Soul," and "The Minstrel Boy" with excellent effect and the repetition of the antiphonal selection, "Adeste Fideles," was received with fresh appreciation.  The band selections elicited equally warm approval, and the finale, in which the band played the "Star Spangled Banner" and the chorus followed with the national hymn, brought out quite a patriotic demonstration.</p>
                            <p>The music-loving public will hear with some regret that it has been practically decided that these concerts must be abandoned.  The big crowds that they draw to the main court have wrought considerable havoc with these decorations and the management has declined to allow them to continue.</p>

                            <p>The Indian day celebration wound up last night in a display of fireworks that delighted the immense audience and elicited copious grunts of approval from the red men.  To the people who were near enough to appreciate it the wonderment and admiration of the Indians were even more entertaining than the pyrotechnical effects.  It was their first view of such a spectacle and even their stoicism was scarcely sufficient to restrain their approval.</p>
                            <p>The display was given at the encampment, but it was fairly visible from nearly every part of the grounds.  It consisted of the usual succession of rockets, bombs, mines and colored effects and terminated with a magnificent set piece, which represented a huge Indian on horseback.</p>

He said that he was very much pleased with the exposition, and added:  "Iowa made a good investment when it decided to be one of the great transmississippi states to advertise its resources.  I predict that the state will be repaid tenfold for the money invested."</p>

                            <p>Prof. F. M. Steinhauser has been elected musical director for the Transmississippi Sangerfest on the 19th, 20th and 21st of August.  The Fest orchestra is composed of forty musicians.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission has filed its statement for the month of July.  It shows that the expenditures for the month were $4,649.09, leaving an unexpended balance of the $100,000 appropriated amounting to $25,085.76.</p>
                            <p>A large party of eastern tourists will leave New York September 1 on a trip to the Yellowstone park and arrangements have been  made by which they will stop at Omaha and spend at least two days at the exposition.  The party will travel in a special train and will include a number of prominent people.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Hardt of the Department of Exhibits is still confined to his bed by an acute bowel trouble which seems reluctant to yield to treatment.  The organization of the Bureau of Awards has been deferred on account of his illness, but an effort will be made to begin this part of the work of the department some time next week.</p>
                            <p>Dr. E. K. Jaques of Minneapolis has arrived in the city and will attend to installing the Minnesota honey exhibit in the Apiary building.  The doctor is an enthusiast on the honey question and speaking of the exhibit now on exhibition, said:  "It is as fine as I have ever seen, but wait until our honey is in place and then I think I will show you something a little bit better."</p>
                            <p>Some of the small boys who have spent their spare time during the summer in devising ways and means to beat the Admissions department have invented a scheme by which they raise the exit turnstiles off the cogs and walk in as easily as though they turned both ways.  The job is done by slipping a piece of sheet iron under the stile, which raises it just enough so it will turn far enough backwards to allow them to squeeze through.</p>
                            <p>The Bureau of Publicity has issued a new illustrated pamphlet which includes some of the best views of the exposition grounds that have yet been issued.  These show the buildings from different points of view and include a number of general views of the Midway, landscape effects and other features.  The book contains a large amount of matter descriptive of the show and a vast amount of information that will be of use to visitors.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Goodwin of the Mines building has just received a quantity of samples of manufactured Verde antique marble, which will be installed among the novelties of the building.  This is a product peculiar to the Santa Catalina island off the California coast and is said to be the only stone that is susceptible of delicate turning and engraving.  The exhibit includes tumblers, finger bowls and a variety of similar articles turned out of the solid marble.  The stone is of a dark mottled color after it is polished and its texture is almost as fine as glass.</p>
                            <p>The Hoohoos of the transmississippi region have fixed upon the night of September 9 as the date for having their grand concatenation, at which time they will do their annual howling.  The grand concert will be upon the roof of the Minnesota building, the structure having been tendered to the Hoohoos and the tender having been accepted.  A number of candidates will be initiated after the transaction of the routine business which brings the Hoohoos together.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Indian congress opened at the exposition grounds yesterday with savage ceremonial more or less appropriate to so important an event is one of the most unique and attractive features of the exposition.  Never before was such an opportunity given to observe the red man in his native habits, methods of life and amusements, for never before were so many representatives of tribes and nations called together.  It is no mean thing to show side by side the Assiniboine and the Jicarilla, the Musquawkie and the Comanche, the Chippewa and the Sioux, the Arapahoe and the Blackfoot, the Cheyennes and the Bannocks, the Wichitas, Osages, Iroquois, Omahas, all the noble, the industrious, the energetic of the race of men found by Lief Erickson and the Cabots.  These form a congress worthy of the closest attention of the casual observer and the deepest study by the student.  Captain Mercer will have in charge during the remainder of the exposition period one of the most remarkable gatherings, whether viewed from an ethnological or anthropological standpoint, ever offered.  The North American Indians is surely fading from among the things that are.  He is following the buffalo and the cowboy and a few more generations will find him but a memory.  It was to catch him while yet he still has the impress of the mint, the mark of his aboriginality, that the Transmississippi Indian congress was provided.  Here for the next three months at least can be found the red man just as nature produces him.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Day a Great Success.</head>
                            <p>Indian day at the exposition was a pronounced success and was enjoyed by the Indians as well as by the thousands of whites who watched the aborigines as they paraded the streets, as they cooked their meals, as they danced their dances and participated in their games.  The day was commenced by Captain Mercer taking 150 of his children of the plains and the forests down town and parading them over the principal streets of the city.  These Indians were mounted and were gaudily attired and painted according to the latest and most approved style.  On their return they reached the exposition grounds at noon and at once proceeded to the center of the open space in front of the office building where they and the Indians who had remained behind participated in a flag raising.</p>
                            <p>Prior to the flag raising, Captain Mercer called the Indians into the square and, through an interpreter, explained the purpose of the gathering.  Those who attended and listened were Bad River and Sac du Flambeau Chippewas, Rosebud, Lower Brule, Cheyenne, Sisseton, Flandreau, Standing Rock and Crow Creek Sioux, Sacs and Foxes, Assiniboines, Omahas, Winnebagoes, Blackfeet, Arapahoes, Jicarilla Apaches, Nes Perces, Comanches, Wichitas, Bannocks, Pueblos, Osages, Iroquois and Poncas.  The Indians on horses formed a large circle, inside of which was placed the Indian band from the Sisseton agency.  Outside of the circle stood the unmounted men of the different tribes, together with the women and the children.</p>
                            <p>As the flag ascended to the top of the mast the band played the "Star Spangled Banner," and as it fluttered out in the wind three cheers were given for Old Glory.  Such cheers were never heard before.  They were given in as many languages and dialects as there were tribes represented, but they were given with a hearty good will, and the hundreds of white who were standing around took up the spirit of the occasion and cheered Old Glory again and again.  This mark of respect to the flag having been shown, Captain Mercer ordered the Indians to their dinner, the band playing "Yankee Doodle" as they scampered away.  From the time of the completion of the meal, all was hurry and bustle in the Indian camp, as the order had gone forth that the parade was to start promptly at 1:30 o'clock.  The parade, however, did not start at that hour.  Indian parades, like those of the white man, are slow in getting in motion, and it was close to 3 o'clock before the aggregation, headed by a squad of Exposition police, swung into line and moved through the gates out into Twentieth street.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">When the Parade Did Start.</head>
                            <p>There were tens of thousands of people lined along the Midway and the avenues of the Bluff tract and although they waited long they felt well repaid for the delay as they watched the Indians come and go.  It was not necessary for the police to clear the way.  The Indians did this themselves and as their column filled the streets from curb to curb, humanity flattened itself out against the buildings and occasionally felt of its scalplock to see if it was still in the proper place.  This was more noticeable among the easterners and southerners than among the people who lived in the west and have rubbed up against the Indians for years.</p>
                            <p>Behind the exposition police marched the Flandreau band and then there were Indians on foot.  They were dressed in apparel that was gaudy in the extreme, but in many instances the quantity was scarce and bare skin was more apparent than garments made of blankets or other material.  Way up in the line there was a sledge drawn by a pony.  On this sledge was what some spectators called a drum.  Regardless of what it was, it was beaten by painted and feathered Indians and the hideous sounds it gave out as it responded to the thumps were only exceeded by whoops and howls of the passing throng.  Following this instrument were more Indians on foot and then there was another one of the instruments of the same vintage as the one that had gone before.</p>
                            <p>There was slight break in the procession, but it was filled in by Captain Mercer and the members of his staff, who headed the mounted Indians.  This break, however, added zest to the occasion, for it was the forerunner of the feature of the parade.  It meant the coming of the 150 reds mounted upon horses and dressed in war costumes.  The Indians who rode were clothed in all of the known colors and painted to perfection.  The faces of some were a dead white, others were black, while other were red, blue or green.  There were as many styles of painting as there were Indians.  Eagle feathers formed a feature of the attire of many of the Indians, especially the Rosebud, the Brule and the Standing Rock Sioux.  There were carried all of the Indian implements of ancient and civilized warfare.  Some had the modern rifle, some the tomahawk, while plenty had the bows and arrows.  Many a brave had a bunch of scalps dangling at his belt, while others held aloft and waved with great satisfaction great bunches of flesh, to which was attached hair, not human flesh and hair, but flesh and hair torn from a beef that had been slaughtered during the morning hours.</p>
                            <p>Amid enthusiasm that extended from one end of the grounds to the other the parade moved through the Midway and over the broad avenues of the Bluff tract, past the state buildings on the west side of the grounds, in front of the Horticultural building and back past the state buildings on the east side of the tract.  It countermarched over the Midways and back into the enclosure, where the Indians enjoyed a brief period of rest.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Entertaining in the Enclosure.</head>
                            <p>There is no rest for an Indian when he is on dress parade for the benefit of his white brother, and shortly after reaching camp the entire population of the village was called over into the enclosure to amuse and entertain <del>at 25 cents per amusement, that being the price charged to gain admittance to the enclosure</del>. It required some time to get the show started and during the interim an Indian maiden of the Iroquois tribe fired arrows at a target, putting them remarkably close to the bull's-eye, but not quite as close as a young man who borrowed the outfit and made several center shots.</p>
                            <p>By this time the Indians had become rested from their tramp and were willing to begin the festivities of the congress.  A party of some twenty marched out to the center of the grass plot and seated themselves cross legged upon the ground.  With them they had half a dozen of their drums.  Each Indian drew from some mysterious pocket beneath his blanket a stick and commenced to belabor some one of these drums, Outruns the Wold acting in the capacity of drum major.  The beating of the drums continued for some minutes, during which time the Indians gathered from far and near, dressed in every style of garb known in Indian life on the plains and in the forest.  They formed a large circle around the drummers, the squaws and children squatting on the outer edge.  The male Indians injected themselves into the center of this circle and then the fun began.  The dance was designated as He Lu Ski, which when put into English means nothing more than Brave Dance.  This is a dance for the Winnebagoes and Omahas and they were the only ones who participated.  An Indian would start out with a slow swinging step.  This he would continue for a time.  Gradually he would move faster and faster and continuing till he fell exhausted.  Then others would dance and fall until about all had taken a turn at the machine.</p>

                            <p>To vary the program, Tom Sloane, an Indian attorney from the Omaha agency, presented a medal to Stone, a member of the Foxes.  The thing was of silver, as big and thick as a saucer and upon one side it bore a figure of George Washington and upon the reverse an inscription, "Peace Forever."  This started the gift making part of the program and Silver Brown of the Omahas stepped into the ring and in the best language that he could command, said that he would give a pony to the Indian he loved best and not to show any partiality he said he would allow S. A. Combs, a white man, to do the naming of the Indian.  Combs did not know all of the Indians and with him it was something as a catch-as-catch-can.  He looked the Indians over and pointed to Smoke Maker as the recipient of the gift.  Silver Brown said that he was satisfied and Mr. Maker got the pony.  After getting hold of the bridle of the animal Mr. Maker said that he had always wanted a white pony and as this one was white his ambition had been satisfied.  Explaining his reasons for giving away the horse, Mr. Brown said that it was the custom for some person to give away a horse whenever the dance just concluded was given and as he had hundreds of ponies he felt it was his duty to do the giving at this time.</p>

                            <p>Somebody suggested that there ought to be more dancing and Oh Le She None, who boasts of having seen the snows of 113 winters, walked around the ring and invited everybody to join.  A lot of old and young men stepped in and as the drums ground out more discords, the dance was continued until it was announced that it was time for a horse race.  This announcement broke up the dance and everybody rushed to the edge of a quarter mile ring while six young Indians brought their ponies into the stretch.  The word was given and off they went like arrows from the bow.  It was not much of a race, for Bunchgrass, ridden by Woodhall from the Omaha agency, distanced all of the others and won in a canter.  After this a friendly game of lacrosse between a couple of picked teams from the Winnebago agency was played, or at least started.  It was not finished for the simple reason that darkness came on too soon.</p>
                            <p>There will be a change in the program today.  It was announced last night that a scalp dance is scheduled for the afternoon, together with some horse races and ball games.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday ranked next to the Fourth of July and the opening day in point of attendance, nearly 13,000 paid admissions being recorded at the gates, while about $6,400 was received through the ticket windows.  It was furthermore a money spending crowd to a greater extent than has been noticed on the grounds of late, and the day will net the exposition upward of $8,000 when the returns are all in.</p>
                            <p>While it was Indian day, the Indians were far from being the drawing card that was responsible for the presence of the crowd.  The big factor was the reduced rates, the attendance being very largely from outside the city.  The redskins, however, promise to be something of an attraction, though it is already apparent that too much is expected of them.  Everything about them is genuine, and therein is where they will fall short of the expectations built up by many.</p>
                            <p>The exposition management is disposed to circus the feature as extensively as possible, and another parade is on the cord for next Thursday, President Wattles having been authorized by the executive committee yesterday to get up a parade of all the exposition features on that day, with the Indians and the Midway as a basis.  It is intended to make that occasion the formal opening of the life saving service and the initial exhibition on the lagoon, as everything will be in readiness by that time.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">FAVOR THE LOW RATES.</head>
                            <p>Ever since the movement for a 25 cent evening rate was inaugurated it has been systematically represented by the opponents of the plan that the exhibitors were a unit against it, and that in case it was put in effect they had threatened to take their exhibits and go home.  This was the statement made by Manager Bruce of the exhibition department before the board of directors and it had considerable effect, coming as an expression of the exhibitors as a class.</p>
                            <p>The fact is the exhibitors are in favor of the 25 cent rate, as was shown yesterday when the managers of 70 per cent of the exhibits in the Manufactures building, including all of the big exhibits with one exception, signed a petition to the executive committee asking that the 25 cent evening rate be at once put into effect for the remainder of the exposition period.</p>
                            <p>Not only did they express themselves as in favor of the reduced rate, but several of them stated that it was not until within the past few days that they learned that they had been represented as opposed to it.  They said that the statements that had been made did not represent their sentiments and that they were in favor of whatever steps might be necessary to secure a crowd.  They had brought their exhibits here to show and a crowd was as necessary to them as it was to the exposition.  They were of the opinion that if the evening was set aside practically for the Midway and the outside features it would result in devoting the days more generally to viewing the exhibits, the visitors would not be so much on the rush and would take time to look more carefully and thoroughly, which was what the exhibitors wanted.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">EVENINGS A FAILURE.</head>
                            <p>So far as the exhibit buildings are concerned, evenings have been a dead letter from the start.  The "live" exhibits are almost, without exception, "dead" in the evening, and more than half of the exhibits have been covered up.  The Government building is closed, and very few people have attempted to explore the half-lighted buildings, as they at once discovered the situation, and recognized the fact that, even if time were devoted to an exploration under such circumstances, it would have to be repeated in the daytime if they wished to really see what was offered for inspection in the various buildings.  The average exposition visitor does not have so much time hanging on his hands as to lead him to voluntarily go over the exhibits twice as a whole.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FIGURES THAT TALK.</head>
                            <p>The sentiment of the board of directors has been gradually inclining toward the reduced rate, as has been evidenced by the decisive vote with which each new proposition for its extension has been favored.  It is realized that from the opening of the exposition to the present time the evening attendance, with the exception of a few nights on which there were pronounced special attractions, have not averaged 500 paid admissions, while on the two evenings on which the reduced rate has been tried it has been approximately 5,000 and 3,500.  A little arithmetical calculation based on this knowledge has intensified the belief of the directors that their ideas on this question were right, and that the executive committee was wrong in its pronounced opposition to a reduction.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska state commission has made its monthly report for July, showing the expenditure of $4,649.09, leaving a balance of $25,085.76 still on hand to defray the expenses of the three remaining months.</p>
                            <p>Phinney's band will give its farewell concert next Tuesday evening.  On the afternoon of that day it will meet the visiting Iowa Knights of Pythias at the Sherman avenue gate, and escort them to the Iowa building, where the afternoon concert will be given.  The Mexican band will be ready to open its engagement on Wednesday.</p>

                            <p>It will not be known for a little while whether the people in Omaha like better to see flowers than Indians, for the number on the exposition grounds Thursday, Indian day, was about the same as Tuesday, which was Flower day.</p>
                            <p>They began coming early, and extra ticket sellers had to be sent to some of the gates as early as 9 o'clock.  A good business was done by the street cars and the Terminal railroad between Omaha and Council Bluffs.  All railway trains coming into the city were full.</p>
                            <p>And the Indians at the encampment on the grounds were just as much interested in Indian day as the public.  They, too, had never seen a day quite like it.  Very few of them, indeed, have ever seen the representatives of so many different tribes together, and the Apaches, for example, are about as interesting to the Musquakies as they are to the whites.</p>
                            <p>The Indians got abroad early.  Soon after their rude breakfast one could peep into a tepee and see a buck stark naked striping his bronze body with paint, and into another and observe a stout warrior trimming up his war bonnet, so as to appear faultlessly dressed in the parade.</p>
                            <p>The whole population was delighted when it was told them through the various interpreters by Captain Mercer that 100 of them were to be taken mounted and with all their war togs on through the streets of the city in the forenoon.  The somber and sober fellows seemed to get excited as when all dressed out and mounted on their ponies they galloped about the camp ground repeating their war cries and yells in concert as if imagining that they were about to advance against an enemy or to engage in the chase.  They seemed to reproach the fence as a barrier and cast longing eyes on the savage looking buffalo penned up for their later amusement and the entertainment of the public.</p>
                            <p>But there was one important ceremony before they should leave the camp on their trip down town.  This was the flag raising.  The Indian band was brought out and while it played "Yankee Doodle" the brightly plumed and befeathered host was drawn up around the flagpole, and as Mr. Wise and the master of commissary ran up old glory the band played "The Star Spangled Banner" and the dusky reds saluted and cheered the flag that now waves over their old hunting grounds.</p>
                            <p>The column then wheeled about and under the lead of Captain Mercer and Messrs. Liddiard and Hege went out the west gate and down into the city.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">RETURN TO CAMP.</head>
                            <p>It was full noon when the fantastic procession got back to camp.  The horses were turned out to some of the tall grass that still remains in that part of the grounds, the warriors doffed their war bonnets and hung them on the fence or on their tepees and the squaws went to work to cook the meat and boil the coffee for dinner.  For an hour the crowd of braves and squaws was thick about the commissary building, retiring as their turn came with pieces of meat or loaves of bread or sacks of rice.  The late return from the city made a late starting out on the big parade of the day, that down the Midway and encircling the bluffs tract.</p>
                            <p>The parade was advertised to start at 1:30, and by that time all the points of vantage along the route were packed, people standing several deep along the Midway and the porches of the state buildings being crowded.  But the procession in which there was so much interest did not appear for an hour, and, in the meantime, many people got tired waiting, and were just beginning to go away to inspect exhibits when the sound of the drum of the Indian band announced that the show was on.  Every brave, squaw and pappoose in the village was in the procession.  Some were on foot, some on horseback, and a few in rude, low carts beating drums and tomtoms.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>A fact especially gratifying to the public was that the representatives of the tribes were all in native costume, and there was a profusion of the paint and feathers and gorgeous ornaments in which the savage heart delights.  The spectacle called to mind many of the old-time pictures of the Indian on his beloved plains, naked, save for a girding about the loins and decorations taken from the animals slain in the chase.  Another gratifying feature was the banners carried designating the tribe to which the several detachments belonged, thus giving to the spectators a brief opportunity to contrast the physical characteristics.</p>
                            <p>About 400 were in the parade.  It was not long in passing, but everyone thought it was a great show.  Several were heard to say that they feared they would see nothing but a lot of Indians trudging along, wrapped in blankets, and they were satisfied when all the glory of savage holiday and war equipment burst upon them.</p>

                            <p>There were only a few who were skeptical about the character of the apparel of the naked bucks.  Some were heard to say that they were in tights, but one young man was squelched when a young lady by his side said, "No, sir; that's hide; just hide; painted hide."</p>
                            <p>The band from the Flandreau Indian school, South Dakota, was at the head with only a detachment of exposition guards in front, and played well, alternating with the war whoops and yells of those behind.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Indian Day Parade Was a Great Thing Down Town.</head>
                            <p>The parade of the Indians at the congress yesterday made through the city streets down town, under the guidance of Captain Mercer and the illustrious "Rattlesnake Pete," Bill Liddiard was a thrilling and interesting spectacle indeed.  There was a long line of these wild horsemen, including the tall Cheyenne, with lithe and graceful figure, in scanty apparel and wild accoutrements&#8212;splendid specimens of the old time native warrior, the terrors of the plains in the days of early emigration.  The Brule Sioux are a majestic lot, big and powerful, but stolid, low-browed, and in their halcyon days were bloodthirsty, treacherous and cruel.  The Ogallalas, Chippewas, Sacs and Foxes, Omahas, Blackfeet, Crows, Santees and Winnebagoes&#8212;they were all there in the glory of war paint, feathers, cows' horns, horses' tails and flaming seraphes.  The big troupe made a wild picture, indeed, as it galloped up Farnam street in bands of four and five in their barbaric holiday attire of wolfskins and scarlet robes.  The Ogallalas showed themselves particularly fond of fanciful trappings and were picturesque in the extreme on account of their grotesque paraphernalia and haughty bearing, which contrasted strongly with the dark-featured Crow and crafty Cheyenne, with their malignant scowls, painted, half-naked bodies, banded wrists and ankles, beads, hawks' plumes and Navajo scarfs.</p>
                            <p>Crowds lined the sidewalks and vied with the aborigines in the medley of sounds they uttered.  There is no mistake that the exposition will score a hit with its latest accession.</p>

                            <p>Flower day, postponed from Tuesday by rain, comes today in fuller bloom than would have been possible Tuesday, and more elaborate.  At least forty rigs will be seen in the procession.  They will go out early in order to enable Rinehart to photograph them.  The parade will begin at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and the carriages will be stretched out with space for viewing each, front and rear, to a pageant about three blocks long.</p>
                            <p>The flower parade will start promptly at 4 o'clock this afternoon.  Those participating are requested to enter the grounds promptly at 3 o'clock by the carriage gate on the east side of Sherman avenue, opposite the Auditorium.</p>

The Lincoln Q. local, which ordinarily only carries three coaches, had fifteen yesterday, and all crowded.  A party of 150 from Lincoln came in on No. 4.

                            <p>Some people may have doubts as to the advisability of adopting a 25 cent rate of admission to the exposition after 7 o'clock in the evening, as urged by the World-Herald, but no <choice><sic>boubt</sic><corr>doubt</corr></choice> exists in the minds of the various concessionaires on the grounds.  They say they are agreed that but three things are essential to a large attendance and brilliant close of the exposition:  These are, viz.:  "Circus" advertising, low railroad rates, and a 25-cent admission at night.  They state that they have been brought here and induced to invest large sums of money under promises of from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 attendance, and now after two months have expired the attendance threatens to fall far short of that; that believing the promises of low railroad rates, proper advertising and fair treatment, they paid 500 per cent more for ground rent and a larger percentage of receipts than was demanded at Nashville, and that as a result of the poor attendance there is not a show on the Midway today that has yet earned 10 per cent of the original investment&#8212;while a great many of them are being operated at a loss.</p>
                            <p>The turn stile reports for the two test nights which the directors granted at the request of the amusement concessionaires association have been taken as a convincing argument in themselves, when an ordinary day's business has been trebled, showing 66 per cent of the total number of admissions for the day were after 7 p. m., and too, without affecting the day's receipts in the least.</p>
                            <p>A great many of the proprietors of places of amusement on the Midway have been to all former expositions, and they have a thorough knowledge of all details pertaining to one, and could even, perhaps, give some of the officials a few pointers on how to operate.  Knowing this, a World-Herald reporter interviewed a number regarding the night rate with this results:</p>

                            <p>Frederick Thompson of Heaven and Hell:  "Does a night rate pay?  Most assuredly.  There is no argument to it.  The first test night drove the nail; last night clinched it.  Nashville at the middle of the season was in the same straits as the Trans-Mississippi&#8212;no attendance and very small prospects.  But the management was equal to the emergency.  It sent out advertising cars with lithographs and billed the surrounding country for miles.  It induced the railroads to give rates whereby it was cheaper to come than to stay at home.  It made a night rate of 25 cents after 7 p. m., and found it worked so well it changed the time to 6 p. m.  Not only did it offer inducements to home people in the way of rates of admission, but also in the form of amusements.  Elaborate displays of fireworks were given every other night, the Innes spectacular and band, the Belstadt-Ballenberg band, Conteruo's spectacular and band, Victor Herbert and various other attractions were offered as an inducement.  Did it pay?  Ask anyone who witnessed Nashville's brilliant close in spite of the Mississippi floods, hard times and yellow fever."</p>

                            <p>C. H. Dezevallos, president of the Concessionaires' association and owner of the giant seesaw:  "Despite the fact that but little effort was made to advertise the 25-cent rate, the attendance last Thursday and yesterday was most gratifying, and I am of the opinion that a great mistake will be made if the rate does not continue.  A large per cent of the people in Omaha are working people, and at the reduced rate working men would not only come themselves, but they would bring their families.  What benefits the concessionaires benefits the exposition,as they are partners.  The exposition is receiving more profits from the shows than the owners of the shows are."</p>

                            <p>Fritz Mueller, proprietor of Schlitz pavillion:  "Four-fifths of the people in Omaha are working people.  They can come to the exposition only at night or on Sunday.  When they do come, they want to bring their families, and unless the rate is reduced to 25 cents they cannot afford it.  This rate should be made and it should be made at once, as I am of the opinion that the success of the exposition depends, to a great extent, on this reduction."</p>

                            <p>Henry Willard, manager of Pabst on the Midway:  "The 25-cent rate at night was the salvation of the Centennial exposition at Nashville.  I fail to see how any man can a good reason why the 25-cent rate should not prevail.  The attendance, if the 25-cent rate is given will not only quadruple the attendance now, but each person will have 25 cents extra to spend on the Midway.  The exposition will, as you can see, receive more money at the gates and also much more from various concessions."</p>

                            <p>Gaston Akoun, proprietor of Streets of All Nations:  "The total attendance at the Nashville exposition was more than 1,700,000, and I am safe in saying that fully 700,000 of those were Nashville people.  I mean by that that Nashville's 100,000 people visited the exposition seven times each.  The 25-cent rate and the 10-cent season tickets induced them to go.  I saw the same people in my show hundreds of times."</p>

Last Thursday ten thousand people paid their way into the grounds.  Three thousand of these attended during the day.  The attendance on ordinary days has been less than 3,000, and I am convinced, therefore, that the cheap rate at night does not affect the attendance in day time.</p>

Average has been tried in other such expositions and has been the means of bringing financial success to the exposition, and midway shows.  I am sure four fifths of the shows will go from the Omaha exposition losers on their investment unless this rate is given.  And, again, the Omaha working people coming at 7 p. m., cannot see one-third of the exposition, and it is no more than equity they should pay 25 cents.  The visitor to the city would not wait <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> night to save 25 cents where his hotel bill is from $3.00 to $4.00 per day.  Hence I beg the support of your good paper in obtaining the 25-cent night rate."</p>

Pierson, Ostrich Farm: "I favor a 25-cent night rate because it brings more people to the grounds who could afford to and would most likely come several nights each week after business hours.  A person will often pay a quarter, but might hesitate at 50 cents, especially when there are more than one in the party.  It undoubtedly would help business and as the exposition draws a percentage of most of all the business done on the grounds, it would of course be benefited financially by the increased business caused by the increased attendance."</p>

A majority of people in and around Omaha have seen the exhibits in most of the buildings and now they want to see the Midway, but they are not willing to pay 50 cents each night.  The exposition management is as much interested in the success of the Midway attractions as are the concessionaires.  The Midway attractions cannot be seen in one night, or two nights, or even a week; and if the rate is reduced men could come and bring their families."</p>

My convictions are based upon past experience at other expositions.  Should a half rate be given to Omaha people, they would be by the half rate induced to visit the exposition after office hours to meet their friends, instead of visiting the parks for an evening's entertainment.  Double the attendance at night by a cheap rate, and the concessions will fill their coffers and add much to the percentage paid to the exposition company.  A half rate at night will be a success."</p>

                            <dateline>CHICAGO, AUGUST 6, 1898.</dateline>
                            <head type="sub">LUMBERMEN'S DAY AT OMAHA.</head>
                            <p>Recognizing the true importance of the lumber industry as a leading factor in the development of the territory most directly interested in the success of the  Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, now in progress at Omaha, the management of that courageous and broad-minded enterprise has very properly set apart a date to be known to the world as "Lumbermen's Day."  On September 9 the lumber fraternity of the nation, the continent and the world, or so many thereof as can, are invited to rendezvous at Omaha with the purpose of sharing in one day's exhibition distinctly given over to them and to be signalized by exercises and features of peculiar interest to all lumbermen.  The convocation thus of large numbers of lumbermen from all sections and representing various interests, will afford participants delightful opportunities of forming new acquaintances and for the promotion of the fellow feeling that moves "birds of a feather" to sympathetic ends.</p>
                            <p>John A. Wakefield, secretary of the exposition, is a lumberman and a gentleman of demonstrated fertility of resource.  Aided by the counsels of other lumbermen throughout the country, whose advice he has invited, there is little doubt that features of the occasion will be presented on "Lumbermen's Day" in the highest degree diverting, interesting and beneficial.</p>
                            <p>A very large contingent of the lumber trade, of the northwest, at least, it is assumed, will naturally plan to attend the exposition some time during the period preceding its close.  In view of this fact, it seems to The Timberman that it would largely conduce to the pleasures of all lumbermen so intending to time their visits so as to be present on their own "day."  In the interest of the trade and its votaries, the latter is what we would cordially recommend in every case possible.</p>
                            <p>As has been shown in these columns, and according to the general tenor of all available testimony on the subject, the exposition comprises an aggregation of features not to be despised even by those in whose memories pictures of the World's Fair are still fresh.  The Omaha exposition brings the whole idea of unrestricted exhibition practically down to the day and the hour, and the Omaha show of course embraces objects and novelties to which the Chicago affair was a stranger.  One of the objections to the World's Fair from the individual standpoint had relation to its incomprehensible vastness and the incidental physical impossibility of seeing and appreciating it all in detail.  Naturally, this objection is in a considerable measure modified in the demands upon one's time and attention at Omaha, and it remains beyond question that to anybody, however blase, the show is well worth a long journey to see and study its splendors and its lessons.</p>
                            <p>And, besides, we are all interested in having it said after the fact that "Lumbermen's Day" was the most notable in the history of the exposition.  We would like to be able to say that, and hope to do so.</p>
                            <p>The committee of lumbermen having the matter in charge have issued the following circular:</p>
                            <p>September 9th, 1898, will be Lumbermen's Day at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, Omaha, Nebraska, and arrangements are practically perfected for the handling of the largest body of lumbermen ever gathered together in the United States.</p>
                            <p>Especially reduced railroad rates to Omaha and return will be made from all points upon that occasion.</p>
                            <p>Special rates will be made to everything on the Midway.</p>
                            <p>A concatenation of Hoo-Hoo will be held on the grounds in one of the Trans-Mississippi buildings and a unique parade of these same cats in costume will be held upon the grand court on that day.</p>
                            <p>A log-rolling contest by imported northern experts will take place in the open lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska lumbermen will keep open house at the Nebraska building.</p>
                            <p>These and several other important features will serve to make the day a memorable one.</p>
                            <p>In the evening there will be a grand pyrotechnic display, including set pieces of objects familiar to every lumberman.</p>
                            <p>The manufacturer, the jobber, and the retailer will be there and an opportunity will be given everyone to extend his lumber acquaintance over an extremely wide territory.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Congressman of the Second Returns for the Summer.</head>
                            <p>Congressman D. H. Mercer arrived in Omaha from Washington yesterday with his family and announced his intention of remaining in the city during the balance of the summer.  He said his first duty would be to thoroughly inspect the exposition, as he had not had the opportunity of coming home to do so heretofore.</p>
                            <p>In this connection Mr. Mercer said he expected that a large number of congressmen and newspaper men from the national capital will visit Omaha during the next two or three months.  All of the newspaper men and many of the congressmen were very much interested in the idea of making up a party to attend the opening of the exposition, but were disappointed by the great pressure resulting from the war, which prevented them from leaving Washington.  The congressmen have now been relieved. and Mr. Mercer says many of them have announced their intention of coming to Omaha to spend their usual summer outing.</p>
                            <p>"The people from the east who visited the exposition during the opening days are just getting back home and getting the news of the exposition distributed among their friends," said the congressman, "and the latter are beginning to realize that the exposition is a good thing and are making preparations to see it.  I believe that the old town will be overrun with eastern people during the balance of the time the exposition is open, and Omaha will be talked about more than ever."</p>
                            <p>According to the telegram received by Mr. Mercer after his arrival in the city, the first contingent of this army of invasion will arrive in Omaha this afternoon, when Congressman Loudenslager of New Jersey and a party of New Jersey officials and prominent people will reach Omaha to remain for several days inspecting the exposition.  The party will come in over the Burlington this afternoon from the south.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contrasts Between This Land as They Used to Know It and as It Is.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Red Men Coming to the Great White City Remark on the Change---Editor Ribok's Instructive Comment.</head>
                            <p>Horace M. Ribok, editor of the Tama County, Ia., Democrat, who is also an Indian agent, is attending the Indian congress at this city, and contributes this striking sketch of what the exposition means to Indians and to the white men:</p>
                            <p>A delegation from the Tama county, Ia., camp arrived at the Indian congress Monday evening about 5 o'clock, after a pleasant but uneventful ride of eight hours across Iowa.  I said it was an uneventful ride, but that is true rather of the writer than the Indians, for to some of them it was like a baptism of youth.  Soon after we had passed Coon Rapids I observed two of the elder members of the delegation with car seats turned facing each other, intensely engaged in conversation, making eager observations from the car window, and gesticulating as if describing some scene of activity of which they evidently had personal knowledge.  As we shot through the rough and rolling country beyond Coon Rapids, they watched every hill and valley with an eagerness that was interesting to the observer and thrilling to them.  The actors in this scene were On-A-Wat and Pa-Na-Na-Que, two of the few survivors of that powerful nation of aborigines who, but a little over a half century ago, held sovereign rights to the best agricultural state in the union, but are now content to possess only 3,000 acres of their former domain.  I wondered at the cause of their interest, at their eagerness.  Presently On-A-Wat beckoned me to a seat beside him, and in broken English volunteered the explanation:</p>
                            <p>"Thirty-seven years oga we kill 'em deer here.  There (pointing out a spot at the foot of a large hill and by the edge of a brook passing through the valley) my wickiup <unclear reason="torn"/>ellu-ka, Pa-Na-Na-Que, John Allen, kill deer.  Some days one, some days five, kill 'em.  Some times not kill 'em any.  Ride all over here, pony.  No fences, no timber Coon river to Missouri.  Thirty-seven years ago me camp here, kill deer, eat 'em.  White man now corn all over; no deer; no more creek, just slough.  Indian show white man raise corn; white man take land, raise corn all over."</p>
                            <p>With these reflections on his observations, the Indian drew his blanket up around him and the conversation ceased, and the wonder is left with us, What does the Indian think of the civilization of his white brother?</p>
                            <p>Regardless of how the Indian may answer this question and what his philosophy of the case may be, the Trans-Mississippi exposition stands conspicuously the most stupendous fact in the history of that magnificent empire lying west of the Mississippi river.  Would that the shade of the illustrious Jefferson might witness the significance of the Louisiana purchase!  Our text books have erected mile stones in history on which are inscribed the expedition of Lewis and Clarke, the conquest of Mexico, the wanderings of the pathfinder, the victory of national authority over border warfare, the subjugation of the red man, and the triumph of law and order over the frontier ruffianism&#8212;but no event in the history of the great west is so significant as the great industrial exposition now in session in this city.  It is the realization of all and more than Jefferson hoped for.  It surpasses the wildest dream of the pathfinder or the pioneer.  It is the most stupendous fact in the history of the people of varied language, customs, color and blood, who inhabit this cast domain.  It is almost as marvelous to the pale face as to the native of the plains.</p>
                            <p>One of the most befitting and timely conceptions of the exposition is the congress of American Indians.  This is the territory of the scenes of his hostile activity.  On these western plains and in these valleys he fought his last battle in the contest with a superior race for the survival of the fittest.  Here he has made his last but hopeless stand, impelled by the intuitive law of self-preservation, for the survival of his race and radical tradition, customs, laws.  Here he has been vanquished from the contest for the sovereignty of the land over which he roamed, and from which he gathered his sustenance, and here he has been compelled to swear an eternal and perpetual peace as a subject, a citizen, of a nation dominated by another race.  When peace came to him and the nation, it settled upon the tents of hitherto hostile tribes of his own race.  What is more befitting than that this era of universal peace between the different Indian tribes and between the Indian race and the nation should be immortalized at a great peace gathering at Omaha, where the arts and industries of the peace that has settled over the vast empire lying between the Mississippi and the ocean on the west are spread before the world, and the world is asked to look, to behold!</p>
                            <p>Just what the impressions of the Muskwakie will be when he passes out the gates of the White City, and bids his brethren from the north, south and west farewell is a matter of conjecture, but at present he is engaged in shaking hands and conversing in the sign language with the sons of warriors of other tribes, against whom his fathers wielded the war club with vehemence and partial success, and he is intensely engrossed in the panorama of peace, friendship and industry which surrounds him.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Twenty Bands and Crocker's Brigade May Be Here September 21.</head>
                            <p>The meeting of the executive committee of the Iowa exposition commission closed Thursday at the Iowa building.  A large part of the time of the meeting was taken up in discussing plans for Iowa day, September 21.</p>
                            <p>Major M. H. Higley, representing the famous Iowa Crocker's brigade, was present to express the desire of the brigade that the date for the state day be set a day or two later.  The reason was that the brigade is to hold its biennial reunion at Jefferson, Ia., September 20, and 21, and most of the members of brigade wanted to come to the exposition for the state day.  The committee was disposed to make the change, but it was found that the two following days were already set apart.  An effort will therefore be made to begin the reunion one day sooner so that the members may come direct from Jefferson to participate in the state day here.</p>
                            <p>It seems likely that twenty or thirty bands from different parts of the state of Iowa will be brought here for the occasion and that excursions will be run from all the principal cities in the state.

The parade will form down town, and just after noon march to the state building.  From there it will parade the Bluff tract and the Midway, winding up at the Auditorium, where the exercises will be held.  There will be band and vocal music and addresses by Governor Shaw of Iowa, Governor Holcomb of Nebraska, President Wattles, Congressman R. G. Cousins, whom the Iowa people like to call "Our Bob"; ex-Governor Saunders, ex-Senator Harlan and other prominent men.</p>

Pinned to it is a sheet of paper giving the facts in the case.  It was captured by company B of the Twenty-second infantry, Omaha's own company, at Juraguasita, Cuba, June 23.  Those making the capture were Captain Neloman and Boyles and Privates Keysor, Cooley and Houghtaling.  It is about four feet long by two and a half wide.  It will be on exhibition in the Government building during the remainder of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Today will be Kansas City day.  The mayor of Kansas City and the city council will arrive in the morning and be the guests of the mayor and city council of this city, who will meet them at the depot and breakfast them at the Millard hotel.  A large excursion from Kansas City is also expected.  Exercises will be held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock.  They will be short.  Addresses of welcome will be delivered by Mayor Moores and President Wattles, and a response will be made by ex-Governor Crittenden of Missouri.  Music will be furnished by the Phinney band.

                            <p>All roads and cycle paths will lead to the exposition August 15, the day set apart as Wheelmen's day at the big show.  That the occasion will be the social event of the season from a cycling standpoint goes without saying.  The Midway concessionaires have responded quite liberally by offering special rates and programs, and the exposition people will allow bicycles on the grounds.  Badges will be given to all attending wheelmen, and several side features of interest to wheelmen are now on the tapis.  Suffice it to say that every bicycle rider attending the exposition on August 15 will have the "mostest fun for the leastest money."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The big crowd of public officials and citizens that Kansas City sent to see the exposition is very much in evidence today.  The pretty badges of the visitors are conspicuous all over the grounds and the people who wear them constitute one of the liveliest and most enthusiastic crowds that has yet visited the show.  The visitors came in on half a dozen crowded trains and during the forenoon they made their way to the grounds in small parties to get a glimpse of the exhibits before the exercises of the day begun.  They found the grounds barely recovered from the drenching of the night before, but the excellent drainage system had carried most of the water away and very little inconvenience was experienced in walking about the grounds.  The local attendance was not heavy during the forenoon, but after dinner the people arrived in great numbers and the crowd began to approximate the dimensions of the preceding days.  The badges worn by the visitors bore the suggestion "You will Have to Show Me," and the management in connection with the local city officials are doing their best to observe the injunction.</p>
                            <p>The official members of the party were a little late in getting out and it was a little after 11 o'clock when they appeared at the Auditorium.  They were escorted to the stage by President Wattles of the exposition association, Mayor <choice><sic>Mooores</sic><corr>Moores</corr></choice> and other city officiation, Mayor Moores, and other city offi- of popular airs and the crowd poured in and partially filled the building.  A few minutes later the Manufacturers' association of Kansas City, headed by Blackman's band, arrived at the grounds and the band was escorted to a place on the stage.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Welcomed to Omaha.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles called the crowd to order and introduced Mayor Frank E. Moores, who welcomed the visitors in behalf of the city.  He assured them that this is no perfunctory duty.  At this time when the great west is making this magnificent exposition of its resources it is eminently fitting that the good fellowship and hospitality, which was no less a product of the west, should not be lacking.  The west had produced Lincoln, whose motto was "Malice toward none and charity toward all."  It had produced Grant, whose magnanimous conduct at Appomattox had done so much to relieve the acerbities of civil war.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores called attention to the fact that Omaha and Kansas City occupied a very similar position in regard to the commercial field in the west.  But this is no reason why their competition should not be of the friendliest character.  Their interests are in the main identical.  What brings benefit to one must in some degree assist the other.  In conclusion he presented Acting Mayor Burroughs with the huge golden <choice><sic>kays</sic><corr>keys</corr></choice> which represented the liberty of the city.</p>
                            <p>In behalf of Mayor Jones, who was unable to be present, Mr. Burroughs expressed the <choice><sic>aprpeciation</sic><corr>appreciation</corr></choice> of the visitors at the very hospitable reception that had greeted them, and was succeeded by ex-Governor Crittenden of Missouri, who responded in behalf of the people of his state.  The speaker declared that they had stopped at the gates this morning and declared with admiration and gratification,  "Behold, a greater than Chicago."  They would return home to proclaim the beauties of the exposition and the hospitality of the city and send the rest of their inhabitants to descend on Omaha like a flight of locusts.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Come to Cheer Us On.</head>
                            <p>Continuing Governor Crittenden declared that they had come to pluck no flowers, but to add brighter colors to our wreaths.  They came from a sister city and they were animated by only one feeling and that to do honor to an enterprise that honored the whole west.  There is no hatred towards Omaha in Kansas City.  They recognized in Omaha a great and energetic city and have no desire to rob it of any of the laurels it has won.  "All hail to Omaha" is the utterance of Kansas City, Missouri, and the great west of which we are all a part, and all shared the expectation that the exposition would bring an added measure of prosperity to the whole west.</p>
                            <p>Referring to Kansas City, the speaker sketched a brief statistical review of its business resources and superior advantages, and declared that if he had access to similar date in regard to Omaha he would speak of it with the same pride.  Omaha has accomplished what no other city dared to undertake and its success has surprised everyone, except itself.</p>
                            <p>Governor Crittenden's address was followed by a selection by Blackman's band and a short address by President Wattles, who said that it was especially appropriate that the first municipal day at the exposition should be celebrated by Kansas City.  No city ever won commercial supremacy by tearing down the prestige of another city.  The interests of the two municipalities were identical.  They were both developments of the pioneer life of the early west.  The future of both depended on the continued growth and prosperity of the same territory.  This neighborly visit was only one of the evidences of good will and encouragement that had been received from Kansas City during the progress of the exposition.  The great enterprise stood like a beacon light and commanded the attention of the world.  That such results could be accomplished in the midst of financial embarrassments by a people burdened by crop failures and evil reports, was the greatest marvel of modern times.  It was an exposition of pluck and energy and enterprise that had never been equaled.</p>
                            <p>More music concluded the exercises, and the crowd was turned loose to follow its own inclinations.  The flower parade will be repeated at 4 o'clock if the weather permits it.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Squaws and Maidens Give a Sample of What They Can Do.</head>
                            <p>The Indian congress drew its share of the exposition crowd yesterday and the people who attended the festivities were apparently satisfied.  During the morning hour there was a dress rehearsal, a number of the tribes putting the finishing touches on the dances which they will give during their stay.  Later in the day a large ring was roped off for the purpose of preventing the whites from crowding up upon the dancers.  This ring is about 100 feet in diameter.  The band stand, or rather the band ring, is in the center and here the Indians will sit upon their haunches and beat out doleful music, while around them will gyrate, the painted and feather-bedecked children of the mountain, plain and forest.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon the congress opened by a party of Assiniboines putting on a friendly dance, which, when uninterpreted, is "Ki Yi Hi."  The dance is an easy swinging affair, the movement being similar to that of a chicken that hops about with badly frozen feet.  This dance continued for an hour or more, after which a number of squaws injected themselves into the ring and gave a dance peculiar to the women of the Sioux tribe.  Like all other Indian dances, this one was accompanied by singing and the beating of wheezy drums.  It is apparent that tune and harmony don't count for much with Indians when they dance, noise being the principal accompaniment.  The women were beautifully painted, red being the prevailing color, though there were many bright stripes of black artistically daubed across their cheeks, lips and foreheads.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Hits-the-Eagle-High-in-the-Clouds was the belle of the ball and won frequent and uproarious applause.  Her step was as light as that of a young fawn.  while her costume was strikingly fetching.  She wore a dress of red blanket, cut decollete at both top and bottom.  Over his she wore muskrat skin rimmed with <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Miss Hits-the-Eagle-High-in-the-Clouds was attired in a dainty suit of yellow calico, reaching to her knees, a girdle of brass encircling her waist.  She encased her feet in slippers of buckskin, hair side in, the tops worked in porcupine quills, dyed red and blue.  Her pantalettese were of blue blanket, cut bias and trimmed down the sides with white braid.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Loves-One-Man and her daughter, Miss Runs-Like-the-Deer, were gowned in blue calico, trimmed with red.  They carried goldenrod for flowers.</p>
                            <p>Miss Hurt-When-She-Was-Young wore white over a red blanket and carried small mirrors for ornaments.</p>
                            <p>Although quite fleshy Mrs. Knows-No-Fear danced as lightly as though she was made of feathers, notwithstanding the fact that she tips the scales at 205 pounds.  Her costume was rich in the extreme.  It was of yellow squaw cloth, a kind of flannel, and was profusely decorated with clam shells and pieces and strips of otter fur.  She wore her hair down her back, with a crown of hawk feathers, dyed crimson, encircling her head.</p>
                            <p>Miss Rides-the-Wind, from the Blackfeet agency, tried to outshine her friends and some of the spectators thought that she did.  She wore a beautiful robe of buckskin, tanned a bright yellow and hand painted.  It was covered with figures representing hunting scenes, with Indian tepees in the background.  Her black hair was gathered in the back and held in place by a strip of red braid, which hung nearly to the ground.  She carried a turkey wing for a fan.</p>
                            <p>There were many other striking costumes which were greatly admired, especially by the white women who stood around the ropes.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Iowa Exposition commission held its meeting yesterday and adjourned.  All the members were present.  September 21 was fixed upon as Iowa day.  The Crocker brigade of Iowa had asked that September 23 be set aside as state day, but upon conferring with the members of the executive committee of the exposition it was ascertained that both September 22 and 23 were set apart for the Woodmen of America, so it was decided to retain the day first considered.</p>
                            <p>Word was received from Ames that three battalions of the cadets from the Agricultural college will be present and take part in the exercises.  The Ladies' Cornet band of Eldora offered its services and the offer was accepted.  It is expected that at least twenty-five Iowa bands will be in attendance and march in the parade that will form down town and proceed to the grounds.  The procession will march over the avenues of the Bluff tract and past the Iowa building, then proceed to the Auditorium, where it will disband.</p>
                            <p>The exercises will be held in the Auditorium and will consist of vocal and instrumental music and speeches.  President Wattles will deliver the address of welcome.  To this Governor Shaw will respond, turning the state building over to the exposition.  Congressman Cousins will speak in behalf of the state.  In the Iowa building there will be concerts continuously from 8 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  In the evening there will be a display of fireworks.</p>
                            <p>The commission stated that a rate of 1 cent per mile had been secured from all points in Iowa and it was probable that fully 50,000 people will be here.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Money-Spending Crowd Makes Things Lively at the Attractions.</head>
                            <p>The attractions on the Midway made all kinds of money last night.  It was a money spending crowd, and while the streets were packed from one end to another, all of the shows had all the people that they could handle until the last hour for closing arrived.  Special numbers were added in many instances and all were enjoyed.</p>
                            <p>The Battle of Confetti drew the crowd to the Streets of All Nations.  In the true sense of the word, this was not a battle.  It was simply the throwing of small bits of paper.  Each person upon entering the streets was given a sack filled with little squares of paper of various colors and the person receiving one of these sacks felt at liberty to throw the contents into the face, or upon the clothing, of any other person.</p>
                            <p>The only thing to mar the pleasure of the evening was a fire at the Bombardment of Fort Mantanzas.  Early in the evening the film used in the movable pictures broke and one end flew against the machine that is used for projecting the pictures.  This film is of combustible material and as soon as it came in contact with the electric light it burned like loose powder.  The department was called, but before its arrival the damage was complete.  Manager Baylis immediately telegraphed for new films, which will arrive in three or four days.  During that <unclear reason="torn"/> he will be tied up.

                            <head type="sub">Uncle Sam is a Generous Provider to His Aboriginal Wards.</head>
                            <p>One of the interesting features at the Indian congress at the exposition is the issuance of rations to the 450 Indians who are congregated within the enclosure.  Along the north side of the tract are located the officers' quarters and storehouses, one of the latter being used as a store from which are issued all of the rations.  The same course of issuing is pursued as at the respective agencies.  On the list kept at the store is the name of every head of a family represented, and the number of persons in each family.  Each family head is given a card designating who he is and how many are depending upon him for the necessaries of life.</p>
                            <p>In order that there may not be a greater rush of business on one day more than another, the Indians are divided into ration parties, and to each party is given rations sufficient to last for the period of five days.  Thus, one party comes in today, another tomorrow and so on until the end of five days, when all have been supplied and the first party is due to report again.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes one man will draw rations for half a dozen families, but as a rule each head prefers to draw for his family and no other.  They sit around the store, smoking and telling stories, much after the style that will be observed at any country cross road.  After one Indian is waited upon, another drops into his place, presents his card, and the food to which he is entitled is weighed or measured and dropped into a sack, after which he hurries back to his camp.  The store opens at about 7 o'clock in the morning, and continues to do business until the last Indian is supplied.</p>
                            <p>The following rations are allowed each person per day:  One loaf of bread and 14 2-5 ounces of flour, 1½ pounds of beef, 4 8-10 ounces of coffee, 16-100 ounces of tea, 1 92-100 ounces of sugar, 1 12-100 ounces of beans, 64-100 ounces of hominy, 1 92-100 ounces of dried fruit, 1-100 gallons of syrup, 1-100 quart of vinegar, 64-100 ounces of salt, 4-100 ounces of pepper, 16-100 ounces of baking powder, 64-100 ounces of lard, 1 64-100 ounces of soap, 9 60-100 ounces of potatoes, 2 40-100 ounces of onions and 60-100 ounces of rice.</p>
                            <p>Experience taught Captain Mercer that the amount of rations heretofore named would not be sufficient to appease the hunger of the Indians, especially as they were working, dancing or playing games a greater portion of the time, so he ordered that one-third more of everything except soap be added.</p>
                            <p>The Indians are not burdened with a large supply of cupboards and cooking utensils, so consequently the matter of caring for their supply of food that is left over after each meal is simple.  Instead of having the cans, jars and crocks that are possessed by the American housewife, they have simply one large sack which contains everything in the cooking line except the lard, vinegar and the syrup.  These articles are put in cans or bottles and placed on one side of the tepee.</p>
                            <p>The beef is issued fresh and consequently during this hot weather it has to be cured in order to keep it from one meal until the next.  In curing meats the Indian squaw is an expert.  After her husband returns from the store she takes possession of the meat at once and begins operations upon it with a sharp knife.  It is cut into strips perhaps half an inch thick and as long and wide was the piece will permit.  These pieces are pierced with a sharp stick and hung from a tree, a pole or the roof of the tepee to dry, great care being taken to put them above the reach of the dogs, which around an Indian camp are even more numerous than the Indians themselves.  After being hung out in the hot sun the odor of the fresh meat attracts numerous flies, but that doesn't count.  They gather in swarms and deposit their eggs, but before the hatching period arrives, the meat has dried and is hard as a bone.</p>
                            <p>While the Indian is not a graduate of any cooking school, he, or rather she, puts up a meal that is as palatable to an Indian as though it had been cooked and served in the most fashionable French restaurant in the land, though it is not usually relished by the white man, especially the one who is troubled with dyspepsia or has a weak stomach.</p>
                            <p>They are great on mixed dishes and as a result the meat, the hominy, the rice and beans all go into one kettle.  There it boils and simmers until it is one mass about as thick as gruel, after which it is ready to serve.  This is seasoned to suit the taste and then dished out into tin vessels and thickened with bread and eaten with spoons.  If it is not all eaten at one meal it is warmed up for the next and warmed again until it is disposed of.</p>
                            <p>Indians all like coffee and they make good coffee, too.  It is black and strong, but the cooks know just how to boil out the flavor.  They drink it boiling hot and as much as they can hold.</p>
                            <p>Like the white man, the Indian eats three meals a day, when he can get them, but if he is forced to a starvation diet, he can go from six to eight days without eating.  In order to do this he draws his belt a little tighter each day and continues his fast until he dies of hunger, or until he finds something to appease the cravings of his stomach.</p>
                            <p>As to the sleeping, the Indian pursues the same customs as his white brother.  He goes to bed early and sleeps late, providing he has no work to do that calls him out in the morning.  However, if he has employment or business matters that demand his attention, he is up before the sun and continues until he has completed his task.</p>

                            <p>Hereafter there will be a regular program of events that will be pulled off at the Indian congress.  Dr. War Eagle, an Iroquois, has been appointed master of ceremonies and he will co-operate with Captain Mercer in furnishing something instructive and amusing.  The program this afternoon and evening will be participated in by the Blackfeet and Assiniboines and will include the following named dances:  Grass or brave warrior dance, dog party or adopting dance, medicine dance, bear dance, tea dance by warriors and squaws, deer dance, pigeon dance and snake dance.  The exercises on Sunday will be of a religious nature.  There will not be any preaching, but there will be dances, all dedicated to the Great Father, the leading Indians in attendance upon the congress having decided to abstain from participating in wild dances on Sunday.</p>

                            <p>Mrs. Andrew Rosewater bombarded the participants in the Flower parade with the contents of a bushel basket of flowers, and Mrs. Colonel Hambleton of the Illinois building also showered a lot of floral missiles.</p>
                            <p>The Eastern Central Passenger association has announced a rate of one and one-third fares for the round trip to Chicago for Commercial Travelers' day, September 24.  The fare from Chicago to Omaha will be one fare for the round trip.</p>
                            <p>W. J. Stewart, secretary of the Society of American Florists favors the department of transportation with a letter that is entirely unique in the correspondence of that department.  He assures Manager Babcock that the florists are well pleased with the rate that has been secured for their annual convention in Omaha and that they will attend in large numbers.</p>
                            <p>The flag over the Life Saving Service building floated at half mast yesterday in memory of Superintendent Nathaniel Robbins of the Lake Michigan district, whose death from apoplexy has just been reported.  Captain Robbins was one of the old-timers in the live saving service and was located at Grand Haven when his death occurred.</p>
                            <p>The heavy rain that soaked Omaha and vicinity early this morning did no material damage at the grounds.  The walls of the lagoon were not perceptibly strained by the flood and there was comparatively little leakage in any of the buildings.  The worst sufferers were Captain Mercer's Indians, whose tepees were scarcely adapted to  withstand the descending torrents, but aside from some inconvenience they were not greatly damaged.</p>
                            <p>Quick action on the part of Captain Haze and a number of other officers prevented what might have been a serious runaway during the floral parade yesterday.  Just as the carriage driven by Mrs. T. M. Orr passed the reviewing stand  one of the horses stepped over the pole and both animals took fright and started to break away.  The plaza was crowded with carriages and spectators and there was a decided flurry for a minute until the police succeeded in getting the horses under control.  A broken carriage pole was the only damage.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The floral pageant that wound through the pretty landscapes of the bluff tract yesterday afternoon scored one of the most notable successes of the exposition.  So uniformly beautiful were the designs that ruled the decorations of the numerous carriages that it is almost impossible to institute comparisons.  Each was perfect in its peculiar pattern and commanded its share of approval, but the most striking feature was the manner in which these varied decorations blended into an ensemble in which the keenest artistic sense could detect no discordant element of color or design.  The entire affair was the work of Omaha women under the direction of Mrs. H. McColl Travis, whose personal supervision was given to every detail and after the parade was over they were fairly overwhelmed with congratulations.</p>
                            <p>The pageant was preceded by a squad of exposition guards, who discarded their clubs for pampas plumes and these were followed by Marshal T. S. Clarkson and his assistant, Harry Thomas, on horseback.  Phinney's band marched next and behind them rode the board of governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben.  The carriages followed at intervals of twenty feet and as there were nearly fifty of them in line the procession stretched over nearly the entire circuit.  The pageant passed in front of the band stand, where it was reviewed by Mayor Moores of Omaha, Mayor Jennings of Council Bluffs and Mayor Graham of Lincoln, who acted as judges, and by the exposition officials and invited guests.  The crowd was enthusiastic all along the route and its appreciation was very impartially distributed.  As the carriages passed the reviewing stand for the third time Mayor Moores presented the handsome banners that signified the opinion of the judges on the relative merit of the decorations.  Mrs. Baldrige's tandem was the first to be thus honored and the presentation of the red banner that signified approval.  The white banner and third prize went to Mrs. John N. Baldwin of Council Bluffs, and then Mrs. J. H. Evans' handsome victoria was called up to receive the blue emblem that carried the first prize.  In making the presentations Mayor Moores said that the judges found themselves no better off than if they had been called on to award the prizes of a baby show.  Where there were so many designs that approached perfection they had found it difficult to make a distinction and he expressed the wish that they might have awarded a prize to every participant.  The carriages driven by Mrs. G. A. Joslyn, Miss Louise Squires, Miss Curtis and Mrs. H. T. Clarke were given honorable mention.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Coming of the Carriages.</head>
                            <p>Immediately following the band appeared the attractive equipage of President Gurdon W. Wattles of the exposition association.  It not only led the procession in regard to official rank, but set a high standard of beauty for the others to follow.  In the carriage were seated President and Mrs. Wattles, Mrs. George F. Bidwell and Mrs. Charles Ogden.  The turnout was a handsome trap with a unique umbrella canopy, drawn by a striking pair of ponies.  The decorations throughout were of pink American beauty roses.  The pink reins were handled by President Wattles himself.  The ponies were gaily festooned in pink roses and ribbons.</p>
                            <p>The greatest part of the procession in respect to size of vehicle, wealth of flowers and group of pretty girls, followed by the carriage of President Wattles.  It was the time-honored tallyho coach of Mr. Al Patrick, and it abundantly reflected the spirit of '98 in its red, white and blue decorations.  Rhododendrons were used in ornamenting the big coach, and as the rosebays were appropriately used in alternate strips of red, of white and of blue, the effect was extremely patriotic, as well as most fetching.  The coach was drawn by four fine horses, gaily caparisoned with the national red colors, and the reins were handled by Mr. Patrick himself.  On the front seat with him sat Miss May Dundy.  The party of fair occupants of the coach was chaperoned by Mrs. Remington, and included Mesdames W. A. Redick, D. H. Wheeler, jr., Edward Sprague, Johnson of St. Paul and Warren Rogers and Misses Mabel Taylor, Grace Allen, Chandler and Brown.  Master Allan Smith acted as bugler in a large manner.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Symphony in White.</head>
                            <p>The third number on the program was a sketch in pure white&#8212;the carriage of the Misses Sharp.  From the white horse in front to the white gloves and other trimmings on the little colored groom in the rumble behind there was nothing but white to be seen.  The Misses Sharp were gowned in white, the spider was beautifully decorated with white roses, the harness covering the white horse was white and was adorned with numerous white ribbons and festoons.</p>
                            <p>There was no more striking equipage in the parade than that of Mrs. Joslyn, with whom was Mrs. Clement Chase.  The body of the handsome victoria was screened from view with red poppies, while the running gear of the vehicle and the harness were completely covered with white flowers of the same variety.  Over 4,000 flowers were used in decorating the carriage, and a few more red ones to set off the white parasols of the occupants.  The carriage was drawn by a pair of beautiful black horses.</p>
                            <p>A very pretty carriage was the fifth in line, driven by Mrs. T. W. Taliaferro, who was <choice><sic>acompanied</sic><corr>accompanied</corr></choice> by Mrs. Paul Charlton.  A handsome spider phaeton was completely covered with white roses and Easter lilies, and the horse was well set off with the same striking flowers.  The occupants of the carriage were beautifully gowned in white, and carried white parasols adorned with the flowers used in the decoration of the carriage.</p>
                            <p>The sixth carriage in line was the trap of Mrs. J. E. Baum, and with her rode Miss Sadie Baum, Mrs. David Baum and Mrs. Charles L. Burr of Lincoln.  It was beautifully decorated with shaded yellow poppies and trimmed with asparagus.  An umbrella canopy, also finely decorated with shaded yellow poppies and asparagus, set off the equipage in an admirable manner.</p>
                            <p>The handsome black victoria of Mrs. Henry T. Clarke and Miss Clarke was prettily decorated with white chrysanthemums, and was drawn by a pair of fiery black steeds.  The occupants were gowned in white and carried fine white parasols.  In addition to the artificial white flowers Miss Clarke carried a quantity of real flowers, which she distributed among her friends.</p>

                            <p>Mrs. Freeman P. Kirkendall had the distinction of having the only blue equipage in line.  With her were the Misses Baum, Burgert and Ada Kirkendall.  The decorations consisted of blue corn flowers and real oats, most appropriately representing the cereal products of the state.  The handsome Kensington was completely covered with the catchy combination of cereal flowers.  The occupants were gowned in white, and carried white parasols that were also trimmed with the corn flower and oats.</p>
                            <p>Miss Elizabeth Allen's tastefully decorated landau presented a lovely picture of yellow and white.  The body and the running gear of the vehicle were buried beneath a wealth of yellow chrysanthemums, the effect of which was pleasingly relieved by the white gowns of the fair young women in the carriage.  With Miss Allen were Miss Reichel and Mrs. Frank Bishop, and the yellow reins were well handled by Mr. James Paxton.  A pair of fine bay horses drew the gorgeous chrysanthemum show.</p>
                            <p>Mesdames Downs and Pennock rode in the tenth carriage, which was driven by the former.  Their Central Park trap was covered with a fine array of red and white roses.  In addition to the fine floral display made by the variegated roses there was an abundance of green grasses gracefully entwined about the spokes of the wheels, completing the pretty picture in a very effective manner.  The horse and white harness were prettily decorated with red and white roses.</p>
                            <p>The first appearance of the royal color of purple came with the equipage of Mrs. J. N. Cornish.  In the broad carriage, drawn by a double team, were the Misses Fannie Cole, Fayette Cole and Louise Doherty, besides a liveried driver.  The carriage was gaily adorned with royal purple poppies of three different shades.  The young women wore white gowns with lavender trimmings and presented a very pretty picture.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>Following the royal purple equipage came a fetching picture in pink.  It was the trap of Mr. and Mrs. George W. Mercer, abundantly covered with La France roses.  The pink bower was well set off with green ribbons and the horses were ornamented with garlands of pink.  With Mr. and Mrs. Mercer were Miss Mercer of this city and Miss Davidson of Bay City, Mich.</p>
                            <p>No. 13 was somewhat unlucky in the Flower parade, as one of the horses jumped over the pole of the carriage and nearly caused a runaway.  The equipage was a most elaborate one and was decorated in Louis XV style throughout.  Crushed poppies of pink and light blue were used in rich profusion to adorn the fine double team and a beautiful effect was produced.  In the carriage were Mesdames T. M. Orr, Charles E. Squires and O. S. Hoffman.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Howard H. Baldrige made an immense hit with the only tandem team in the procession and the award of second prize to her was most popularly received.  The stylish trap was covered with a rich display of cerise poppies and smilax.  The horses were adorned with garlands of the same flower and the attendants were liveried becomingly.  With Mrs. Baldrige rode Mrs. Richard Carrier, and both were appropriately gowned in red.</p>
                            <p>The elaborate turnout of Mr. and Mrs. S. A. McWhorter was a little late, but it got there just the same.  It was one of the most notable equipages in the procession.  A large double carriage was transformed into a bed of pretty tea roses of the lightest shades of cream.  A wealth of natural rose foliage was used with good effect to supplement the roses.  Scarlet ribbons were seen in streamers about the carriage and in the harness.  Mr. McWhorter handled the reins himself and with him were Mrs. McWhorter and pretty little Miss Moore.  Little Gardner McWhorter wore a sit of white and his brother, Donald, appeared in a uniform of gold.  The outriders, seated on ponies, were Hugh McWhorter and James Fair, and both wore suits of brilliant scarlet.</p>
                            <p>Miss Guckert and Miss Sharpe appeared in the next equipage and attracted much favorable notice.  A swell Stanhope rig was out of sight beneath a multitudinous collection of burnt orange chrysanthemums.  The color effect was notably successful.  The occupants wore dresses of white with white hats.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Welcome for Pony Carts.</head>
                            <p>Miss Eugenia Morand drove the first pony cart in the procession and was the recipient of much applause.  Her dainty little pony cart was transformed into a bower of pink roses for the occasion.</p>
                            <p>The eighteenth number on the program of the parade was another pony cart equally well received.  It was that of Miss Mary Mercer, driven by Master Burnham Chase.  The cart was gay with red poppies, wild oats and other grasses.</p>
                            <p>Miss Nellie Bennett drove a high trap with umbrella top.  It was a gorgeous display of royal purple and it combined so many novel features that it was most popularly received.  She was accompanied by Mrs. J. W. Woodward.  A well liveried coachman occupied the rumble of the trap.  The decorations combined three various shades of violet, lavender predominating.  Chrysanthemums of a violet color were used with a good effect.</p>
                            <p>One of the swell turnouts in the procession was the cabriolet of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Franklin Smith, drawn by a pair of bay horses.  The carriage was decorated with La France roses.  Garlands of smilax added greatly to the effect.  With Mr. and Mrs. Smith were Mesdames John Bastler and Churchill Barker.  They were gowned in white organdies over pink silk with pink and white picture hats.</p>
                            <p>A very attractive equipage was that of Miss Parrote, with whom rode Miss Goodrich, Mrs. Eva Parrote Sweeney and Mrs. J. P. Whitney.  On the steps were Ruth Slabaugh and Joy Bailey, two pretty little misses.  The handsome landau was abundantly decorated with white water lilies filled with asparagus grass.  The horses were adorned with white lilies and asparagus also.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Some Fetching Effects.</head>
                            <p>Miss Louise Squires, accompanied by Miss Edna Cowin, drove a two-wheeled cart with umbrella top which had been transformed into a magnificent design in La France roses.  The flowers were shaded from a delicate pink to blood red and the shades were tastefully combined to produce a decidedly fetching effect.  Fred Nash and Fred Hamilton accompanied the turn-out as outriders.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. A. J. Love, Mrs. Kate Dewey Squire, Mrs. Charles Offutt and Miss Georgia Lindsey rode in Mrs. Love's handsome equipage, which was simply, but very effectively, decorated.  The flowers were morning glories of every conceivable color and their variegated tints were relieved by trimmings of broad satin ribbons of white and yellow.  The whip was trimmed to represent a shrub entwined with morning glories and green trimmings of asparagus completed the design.</p>
                            <p>One of the prettiest designs in pure white was that of the phaeton of Miss Alice Andreesen.  The vehicle was solidly banked with huge white roses arranged in unique and attractive designs and not a glimpse of any other color was visible.  The horse was as white as possible and even the harness and the spokes of the wheels were concealed under a covering of white.  Rosettes and festoons of white satin ribbon completed the effect.  Miss Andreesen was accompanied by Miss Marian McDonald of St. Joseph.</p>
                            <p>The decoration of the Noyes carriage was a pretty combination of Ak-Sar-Ben colors.  The main feature consisted of red and yellow poppies and the effect was emphasized by shades of deep green.  The design included trimmings of yellow satin ribbons, which harmonized perfectly with the floral decorations.  The carriage was occupied by

                            Mrs. A. H. Noyes and Misses Elsie and Vera Noyes.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. A. B. Brandeis drove one of the most elaborately decorated vehicles in the parade.  A butterfly design was worked out with exceptional perfection of detail and the flowers were merely an incident to the main design.  The carriage carried Mrs. Brandeis, Mrs. H. Freedman, Mrs. E. Fisher and Mrs. J. Marcus of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>Miss Ura Kelly drove a trap which was arrayed in a beautiful decoration of La France roses and pink tarleton.  The decoration displayed a peculiarly effective color shading and was designed with exceptional taste.  Miss Kelly was accompanied by her guests, the Misses Grace and Marian Sanbourn of St. Paul.</p>

                            <p>Mrs. M. C. Peters and Miss Peters rode in a spider phaeton decorated with pink roses and lavender chrysanthemums.  The design afforded a notable opportunity for delicate effects in shading, and it was improved with remarkable success.</p>
                            <p>Yellow and black were the prevailing colors in the very pretty decoration of Mrs. Charles E. Ford's carriage.  The glossy black of the vehicle was allowed to be visible in part and it afforded an effective background for the added design in yellow roses and ribbons.  Mrs. Ford was accompanied by Mrs. Will Gyger of Philadelphia and Mrs. Will Wyatt.</p>
                            <p>Miss Jessie Dickinson and Miss Mae Mount drove a very striking turnout in burnt orange and yellow.  The effect was produced by an artistically contrived design in chrysanthemums and yellow ribbons.  The parasols, which were decorated in harmony with the main design, added materially to its effect.</p>
                            <p>The pony trap driven by Master Julius Maurer was decorated with pink, white and yellow roses with decided success.  The other occupants were Misses Daisy and Anna and Eddie and Rudolph Maurer.</p>
                            <p>The Webster trap presented a particularly imposing appearance.  It was tastefully decorated with white chrysanthemums over an outline of smilax and was drawn by a pair of white horses that were also decorated with the same flowers.  A. V.

Reed were the outriders, Fred Empke of Council Bluffs held the reins and Miss Nellie Law of Henry, Ill., Miss Nellie Moore of Council Bluffs, Miss Mabel Balcombe, Mrs. Webster and Miss Flora Webster occupied the trap.</p>
                            <p>Misses Alice Parker, Ethel Wilcox, Cecil Parker and Harriett Marsh rode in Miss Parker's pretty double carriage, which was profusely decorated with poppies.  Black and yellow were the colors and these were gracefully combined in a very striking and artistic design.</p>
                            <p>The carriage driven by John N. Baldwin of Council Bluffs, which was awarded the third prize, was strikingly arrayed in three shades of large red poppies.  The difficult task of working out a really tasteful design with such gorgeous materials was very successfully accomplished.  The carriage was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. John N. Baldwin, Miss Genevieve Baldwin and Miss Elinor Stewart.</p>

                            <p>The beautiful victoria which won the distinction of being adjudged the most artistically decorated equipage in the parade was occupied by Mrs. J. H. Evans and Miss Amy Barker.  The decorations were designed by Mrs. Martin Meyer and were especially delicate and original.  The carriage was banked with heliotrope and white chrysanthemums which were arranged in a very fetching design of Van Dyke points.  The wheels were decorated in a similar manner and the horses wore purple pampas plumes and rosettes of the colors that formed the main design.  The coachman was attired in black satin.</p>
                            <p>Miss Anna Shiverick contributed one of the most artistic equipages in the parade.  Her carriage was upholstered in white on which the lattice work of smilax produced a remarkably pretty effect.  The design was very delicately shaded with the borders of pink chrysanthemums.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. J. M. Metcalf, with Mrs. A. P. Metcalf of Lincoln, rode in a handsome carriage of shaded pink hollyhocks and foliage.  This was a simple but very beautiful design, the combinations of the various tints of the flowers being particularly effective.</p>
                            <p>Miss Mae Hamilton and Miss Bessie Yates rode in a victoria that was a beautiful design of lavender and royal purple chrysanthemums.  They were gowned in pure white with lavender hats and parasols.  Robert Patrick and Captain Will Cowin were their outriders.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. G. W. McGeath's pony cart was a very pretty effect in which white and pink roses, satin ribbons and smilax were artistically combined.  The cart was occupied by Mrs. McGeath, Miss Frances Tibbetts and Miss Julia Coe and Master Windsor McGeath in white livery acted as footman.  Miss Leo Brown, also attired in white, accompanied the turnout as outrider.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. C. J. Barber and Miss Alice Barber contributed another very attractive decoration of chrysanthemums.  Lavender was the prevailing color of the flowers, and these made a very pretty contrast to the white satin ribbons which were lavishly twined among the blossoms.</p>
                            <p>The last equipage in the parade was Jack Cudahy's trap, which was driven by Miss Lynn Curtis and Miss Daisy Doane.  The entire design was pure white except the minimum of color afforded by the black livery of the coachman.  White roses formed the entire design, and they completely covered every outline of the vehicle.  The horses were almost as white as the roses and the harness was also decorated with the same.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Milwaukee Line Announces a Slashing Reduction in Fare.</head>
                            <head type="sub">OUTCOME OF CANADIAN PACIFIC WARFARE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Failure of the Chicago Meeting to Secure an Adjustment of the Northern Difficulties Opens the Door for the Row.</head>
                            <p>The passenger rate between Omaha and Chicago will be cut in both directions from $12.75 to $9.25 by the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul railway on Tuesday of next week, August 9.  The cut is a deep one, amounting to nearly 25 per cent.  It is the biggest cut in passenger rates made by any of the Omaha-Chicago lines in a number of years.</p>
                            <p>The reduction is the direct result of the failure of the Canadian Pacific to help the American lines restore northern rates.  It is believed that the cut of the Milwaukee will be followed by a corresponding reduction on the part of three other Omaha-Chicago lines.  The cut comes at an opportune time for the exposition and railroad men believe that it will largely increase travel to the big show so long as it remains in effect.</p>
                            <p>The advance notice of the cut was sent to General Western Agent Nash by telegraph from General Passenger Agent Heafford last night.  The telegram follows:</p>
                            <p>Among the results of the Canadian Pacific competition has been the reduction of rates between St. Paul and the east via Chicago to such an extent that ticket brokers cannot only manipulate fares between New York and Chicago, but also between Chicago and St. Paul in both directions.  Many of these through tickets have come into the market and have scalped the local rates via Chicago-St. Paul lines to such an extent that the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul railway has, in self-defense, been compelled to give notice of a reduction of regular tariff rates from $11.50 to $8, commencing the 9th inst.  This rate has also been tendered connecting lines as a basing rate, and as common points business beyond the Missouri river is necessarily affected, it is also decided by that company to reduce local rates between Chicago and Omaha in both directions to $9.25, also effective the 9th inst.</p>
                            <p>There is every indication that the conference on reduced railroad rates to the exposition to be held today will be largely attended by prominent passenger officials and most of the exposition directors.  The meeting will be held in the Administration Arch on the exposition grounds at 11 o'clock.  Manager Babcock has made arrangements for a full stenographic copy of the proceedings.</p>
                            <p>Before going out to the exposition grounds the railroad men will hold a meeting at the Elkhorn headquarters.  Among the passenger men who are expected are:  General Passenger Agents Heafford of the Milwaukee, Sebastian of the Rock Island, Eustis and Francis of the Burlington, Lomax of the Union Pacific, Buchanan of the Elkhorn and Assistant Passenger Agents Cairnes of the Northwestern and Payne of the Missouri Pacific.</p>

                            <p>Quite an exposition rate session was held at the Administration arch this morning on the exposition grounds.  There were present the members of the Western <choice><sic>aPssenger</sic><corr>Passenger</corr></choice> association, representing the passenger departments of the Burlington, the Rock Island, the Northwestern, the Missouri Pacific, the Elkhorn, the B. &amp; M., and the Union Pacific.  Nearly all the general passenger agents were present, only one or two being represented by their assistants.  The exposition executive committee and the committee from the Commercial club was also present.</p>
                            <p>E. Rosewater, Herman Kountze and J. E. Baum presented the argument for the lower rate on behalf of the exposition, and P. E. Eustis of the Burlington represented the railroads.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was in executive session from 11 o'clock until nearly 2, when adjournment for luncheon was taken, and the meeting was resumed.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday's attendance numbered 4,872 paid admissions, and fell considerably short of what was expected of Kansas City day.  The numbers that had been reported as coming did not materialize at the gate.  The small size of the crowd was especially noticeable when compared with the crowds that had thronged the grounds all during the week.</p>
                            <p>The week just closed saw a total attendance of about 80,000 people.  The week just beginning will not, however, make this kind of a record, as there are few special features, the biggest day anticipated being St. Joseph day, next Saturday.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee knocked out the 25-cent rate for today, and the concessionaires were figuring last evening on having nothing to do today.</p>
                            <p>The abominable system that is maintained by the buildings and grounds department with reference to the Manderson street gates resulted in a disturbance at an early hour yesterday morning that culminated in a shooting bout and slugging match.  Jimmy Lindsey, the pugilist, appeared at the gate, and wanted to cross to the gate on the opposite side of the street.  He did not have a pass, and the guard told him no money could be received there.  Lindsey proceeded to kick a hole in the fence and walk through.  Several of the guards attempted to arrest him, and Lindsey pulled a gun and began to shoot.  No one was injured except Lindsey, who was clubbed into unconsciousness, after which he was locked up, charged with shooting with intent to kill.</p>

                            <p>The situation with reference to these gates has been steadily growing worse.  The fencing up of the grounds shut in the people on Manderson street on both sides of Twentieth, with a fence on three sides of them.  They were promised by the exposition management that if they would quietly submit to being thus boxed up they would be provided with two gates through which they could pass without annoyance.  Every few days a new rule with reference to the gates has been put in effect by the buildings and grounds department, and the storm of indignation on the part of the surrounding residents has been steadily growing.  Passes have been issued to some of the interested parties, but the majority have not been provided for.  Families have been cut off from their grocers, butchers, druggists, doctors and neighbors, who were formerly but a couple of blocks away, and who are now removed to a dis-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The volume of excited protest has reached the point where it is stated that, unless something is speedily done to relieve the situation, the interested parties will chop down the fence and test their rights <choice><sic>i</sic><corr>in</corr></choice> the courts.  The situation is one that admits of easy solution, as guards are present at b<unclear reason="cut off"/>gates all the time, and the openings are close together on both sides of the streets.</p>

                            <p>The Western Passenger association and exposition directory and Commercial club railroad rate committees held a satisfactory conference in the Administration arch, exposition grounds, yesterday, and one which is confidently believed will result in the announcement of greatly reduced rates within a very short time.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was called to order at 11:15 o'clock and remained in session until nearly 1:30 o'clock, when all present adjourned for lunch at the Markel viaduct restaurant.  The Western Passenger <choice><sic>assomiation</sic><corr>association</corr></choice> later held an executive session to consider the <choice><sic>csalper</sic><corr>scalper</corr></choice> situation in Omaha, exposition rates and other matters.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock of the Transportation department was elected chairman of the conference and without a formal motion it was decided that it should be an executive session, all but the railroad men and members of the two committees being excluded.</p>

                            <p>The rates asked for by the exposition and Commercial club committees, and which were discussed, were these:</p>

                                <p>One fare for the round trip, tickets to be sold daily with fifteen days' return limit, from all points in Western Passenger association territory.</p>
                                <p>One cent per mile on state and city days, tickets to be good for return trip ten days.</p>
                                <p>Local excursion trains, for distances of 200 miles, arriving in Omaha in the morning and leaving in the evening, one-half cent per mile.</p>
                                <p>Red letter days, distances of 200 miles, one cent per mile ,three days' limit for return trip.</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>Messrs. Kountze, Rosewater, Baum, Babcock, Montgomery and Utt argued for the putting in of these rates.  Chairman Caldwell of the Western Passenger association, Mr. Eustis of the "Q.," Mr. Heafford of the Milwaukee, and Mr. Buchanan of the Elkhorn spoke from the railroad point of view, the discussion being conducted in an amicable and friendly spirit.</p>
                            <p>The railroad men did not discuss the question of rates quite as directly as was expected, the line of difference being more clearly drawn on the question of time than on the details of the rates to be given.</p>
                            <p>The exposition and Commercial club speakers asked that the rates named above be put in force August 20, and that the announcement of them be made at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                            <p>The railroad speakers on the other hand argued that the rates should not be put in until September, and that the big crowds would not come, and could not be expected until next month.</p>

                            <p>After lunch the Western Passenger association held an executive meeting in the large office in the Service building, exposition grounds, which did not adjourn until after 4 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Caldwell stated after the meeting that an arrangement had been reached on the exposition rate question, and that the roads represented were a unit on the recommendations which would be made to a general meeting of the Western Passenger association to be held in Chicago next Wednesday.  Exactly what there recommendations were Mr. Caldwell would not state, but both the conference with the exposition directory and Commercial club committees and the meeting of the Western Passenger association, he declared, had been very satisfactory, and while not so stating <unclear reason="torn"/> Mr. Caldwell <unclear reason="torn"/>ing next Wednesday, which is to take final action on the question, would also be satisfactory to Omaha.</p>

                            <p>From a reliable authority the World-Herald learned last evening that the recommendations decided upon, and which will be urged at the Chicago meeting next week, are for substantially the same rates and time limits asked for by the exposition directory and Commercial club committee, and which are printed above.  The roads represented in yesterday's meetings were the Burlington, Union Pacific, Northwestern, Missouri Pacific, Rock Island, Port Arthur, Milwaukee, Omaha, Elkhorn, Kansas City and St. Joe &amp; Council Bluffs, and as these were the roads most vitally interested the same authority stated that the recommendations made by them would very probably be accepted by the other roads in the Western Passenger association.  Should they not be, it was stated positively and without equivocation, one of the principal Chicago-Omaha lines will at once announce reduced round trip and special day rates on its own account, as will also at least one line from Omaha to the southeast, thereby compelling all other roads to do the same.  It was also stated that the officials of these two roads have been ready, and, in fact, anxious to make lower rates, and have only been held back from doing so on the belief that the Western Passenger association would act promptly and favorably in the matter.  It was expected by them that the matter would be definitely settled by this time and the meeting Wednesday next is the longest time they will wait for it to be settled.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Strikes the Iron in Attendance Upon the Indian Congress.</head>
                            <head type="sub">HE IS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD</head>
                            <head type="sub">Belongs to the Standing Rock Sioux and Has Had a Varied Experience with Life on the Plains.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Among the Indians who are in attendance upon the congress there is none more noted than the old chief, Strikes the Iron, a Standing Rock Sioux brave.  This Indian is close to 100 years old, and has seen more of life upon the plains that have the Indians of some tribes if all of their experience and observation could be combined.  Strikes the Iron has watched the march of progress, and at last has resigned to the inevitable and reads the story of his future in the falling of the leaves of the forest.</p>
                            <p>Strikes the Iron has not always been a friend to the whites.  He is uncertain about the place of his birth, but he is of the opinion that the important event occurred not far from Albert Lea, Minn.  His ancestors were fighters and consequently he inherited the spirit of bravery which was first taught to him when he was a suckling at his mother's breast.  His early days were spent upon the Minnesota prairies and later on he became a great and famous hunter.</p>
                            <p>The manner in which Strikes the Iron received his name is interesting.  It has been said by writers of fiction that when an Indian is born the father steps to the outside of the tent and names the young hopeful after the first object that he sees.  This, however, is not true.  As a rule Indian children are nameless until such time as they perform some act that will entitle them to a name.  This at least was the case with Strikes the Iron.</p>
                            <p>For some fifteen years he hunted and shot down game with his arrows, and was referred to as Kio Kio's son.  Later on, however, he made a hit and earned a name.  He was up in the iron region in the vicinity of the present city of Duluth, with a party of hunters.  One day the young lad saw a deer passing, and fired an arrow at the animal.  The aim was true, and the beautiful creature fell pierced to the heart.  The arrow had gone through the body, but it did not stop.  It went onward in its course and struck a ledge of iron ore, and rebounding the flint head came back and struck the young man in the eye, cutting the member from its socket.  Immediately thereafter the Indian was given the name of Strikes the Iron, a name which he will carry to his grave, as that is the name which is registered on the ration rolls at the agency.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">Feasted as a Warrior.</head>
                            <p>The losing of an eye was an epoch in the life career of the young Indian and upon his return home he was feasted and knighted as a warrior.  In 1862 he was mixed up in the Indian troubles and if the stories told about him are true he hung several white scalps to his belt.  Regarding this, however, he is not talkative and when approached upon the subject shuts up like a clam.  After the killing of the whites at New Ulm, Strikes the Iron moved with his tribe to the plains of Dakota and eventually drifted into the Cannon Ball river country, where he remained unknown until the settlement of the Black Hills country in 1875.  He had become something of a medicine man, but he never aspired to be a leader among his followers.  During this year, believing that the white man was encroaching upon his domains, he headed a small party of braves and pursued his course from the Missouri river into the region along the stage line between Bismarck and Rapid City.  For a time he and his followers devoted their attention to running off horses of the gold seekers who were flocking into that country around the hills.</p>
                            <p>Their method was simple, but effective.  The horses would be turned out for the night to graze and just before sunset Strikes the Iron and his associates would appear upon the scene.  Like snakes they would crawl through the grass until close to the horses, when with an unearthly whoop they would spring to their feet, swinging their blankets over their heads.  This would stampede the animals and drive them from camp, after which their capture was an easy matter.  The horses would be ridden to the nearest camp, after which the <unclear reason="torn"/> until Strikes the Iron and his little band had nearly enough horses to supply the entire Sioux nation.  His horses he drove into the valley of the Moreau river, opposite LeBeau, where they were herded by his sons and sold to both friendly Indians and whites.  By Strikes the Iron this was not regarded as horse stealing, as his people and the whites were at war and everything captured was regarded as a trophy of the chase.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Tells of a Personal Conflict.</head>
                            <p>Strikes the Iron declares that during the Indian war of 1876 he never killed a white man or woman, but he admits that he was man or woman, but he admits that he was a friend and bosom companion of Sitting Bull, the most cruel and crafty of Indians.  He takes great pleasure in recounting the deeds of heroism performed by himself and says that numerous times he and his people have fought the Cheyenne Sioux and that he has had many hand-to-hand conflicts.  One of the most interesting ones he told through an interpreter.</p>
                            <p>"Some sixty years ago, when I was a young man and full of vigor, I was out in the Minnesota woods hunting elk, of which there were many at that time.  Passing through dense underbrush I came to a narrow but deep stream, over which a tree had fallen.  It was necessary to walk over this log or else go miles around and I was not in a mood to go around.  I started to cross and when about half way over I met a Chippewa, who disputed my right to the passage.  For a few moments we carried on a conversation in the sign language and neither seemed inclined to turn back.</p>
                            <p>"There was no use of arguing and both stripped for the fray for the purpose of ascertaining who was the best man.  We went at it with knives and fought like demons.  This continued for nearly an hour, during which time I received several severe cuts and wounds, I at the same time punishing my opponent.  It was apparent that it was a fight to the death and putting all of my energy into one mighty effort I grappled with the Chippewa and plunged the knife into his body.  The blood spurted out in a stream and his body fell into the water and floated away, while I pursued my course."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Another grist of exposition visitors began to accumulate on the grounds this morning and quite a number of those who came last week remained to keep them company.  Monday is considered by the concessionists and exhibitors the least promising day of the seven, but the arrivals were sufficiently numerous today to forecast another active week.  People who have been deferring their trip to Omaha until fall, on account of the heat, would have discovered their error today, for the conditions for enjoyable sightseeing could not be surpassed.</p>
                            <p>The obstinate drizzle that caused the postponement of the flower parade last Tuesday was indirectly responsible for the painfully emaciated appearance of the Sunday crowd.  The parade occurred Friday at the hour when the Board of Directors would otherwise have met.  Consequently there was no meeting of the board and in the absence of legislation to the contrary the Sunday admission was 50 cents.  Hence the general unanimity with which the local people stayed at home.</p>
                            <p>The return to the full rate and the sharp shower that fell early in the afternoon confined the attendance largely to out-of-town people who wanted to see the exhibits and were consequently willing to pay as much as on a week day.  There was enough of them to make a showing on the ground, but the purely local attendance was the lightest there has been on any <unclear reason="torn"/> large number of excursionists who were on the grounds Friday and Saturday remained for a final inspection of the show and they had it practically to themselves.  The evening brought some additional arrivals, but at no time did the crowd compare with the attendance of the preceding Sundays, when the 25-cent rate brought out the Omaha workingman with his family.</p>
                            <p>The change in the character of the crowd was apparent in the entirely different manner in which it put in the day.  On previous Sundays it was largely composed of local visitors, who went with their families to spend a quiet day on the grounds.  They loafed in the shaded corners, listened to the music and seemed disposed to get a complete rest out of their holiday.  Yesterday the grounds were tenanted by people who came to be amused rather than rested.  The crowd was continually on the go.  There was a perpetual procession through the exhibit buildings and the Midway and little of the quiet relaxation that has been the most prominent feature of previous Sundays.  Even the band concerts commanded the attention of only a small proportion of the visitors and the pretty retreats under the colonnades and on the Bluff tract were practically deserted.</p>
                            <p>While the crowd was more restless than usual it was by no means disorderly.  The same stringent regulations that have been enforced every Sunday were still observed and any one who came to the grounds to indulge in any relaxation unbecoming to the day was disappointed.  The general good order was a subject of much favorable comment from visitors who were spending their first Sunday at the exposition and they admitted their conviction that the Sabbath could be as well observed at the exposition as at home.</p>

                            <p>The lifeboat, with which the exhibitions of the United States Life Saving service are to be given, arrived yesterday and the first exhibition will be given on Thursday afternoon.  It will require a day or two to clean up the craft and get it ready for use and then the exhibitions will be a permanent daily feature of the exposition.  The new boat is exactly similar to the large boat first received, except in size, and it can be easily handled by the eight men who compose Captain Knowles' crew.  With this added to the equipment that was already on the grounds the crew will be able to give a realistic illustration of every feature of work of the service.</p>
                            <p>The program for this week includes a number of features of scarcely less interest than those that just transpired.  Monday is an off day, but the special musical attraction in the evening will prevent it from being entirely featureless.</p>
                            <p>Tuesday is dedicated to the Iowa Knights of Pythias, who will celebrate it informally, but enjoyably.  A low railroad rate has been secured especially for their benefit and the reports received by the local committee indicate a large attendance from all the Iowa divisions.  The principal feature of the day will be a parade of the Knights at 2 o'clock, headed by Phinney's band, and at 2:30 the band will give a concert at the Iowa building, composed of selections especially appropriate to the occasion.</p>
                            <p>The Red Men will be the guests of Wednesday and Thursday and on Wednesday they will participate in one of the most elaborate celebrations yet given on the grounds.  They will march to the grounds in the forenoon, after parading through the principal down town streets, and at 11 o'clock they will indulge in a session of music and oratory at the Auditorium.  At 6:30 they will give a big sham battle and the concert and fireworks will occupy the evening.</p>
                            <p>Thursday the exposition management will furnish entertainment.  It will consist of the first exhibition of the life saving service, a big spectacular parade which will include all the Indians and the Midway features and a brilliant fireworks display in the evening.</p>
                            <p>Saturday will be St. Joseph day and the people of that enterprising city promise to come several thousand strong and make it the biggest municipal celebration of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant Commander Stedman, in charge of the naval exhibit at the government building, returned from Washington this morning.  One object of his trip was to hasten the shipment of the dry dock and other new features that were promised for his exhibit.  The dry dock, the model of the battleship Illinois, a four-inch rapid firing gun and other items were shipped last Tuesday and are likely to arrive in Omaha any day.  Commander Stedman has also secured a breech plug from one of the big thirteen-inch guns which will arrive with the rest of the shipment.  This is one of the most interesting mechanical features of the big guns and will illustrate the manner in which they are manipulated.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee has concurred in the action of the Pennsylvania state commission designating September 5 as Pennsylvania day.</p>
                            <p>Heretofore the electric lights on the Grand Court have been turned on at 8:30 o'clock at night, but owing to the fact that the days have grown <choice><sic>murch</sic><corr>much</corr></choice> shorter the grounds are lighted half an hour earlier.  The change was made last night and from now until September 1 the grounds will be lighted at 8 o'clock each night.</p>
                            <p>Clinton Boydon, an Omaha lad of 11 years of age, was wandering through the Manufacturers' building yesterday afternoon and forced his finger into the gear of a bicycle that was operated by electricity.  He drew the digit away as soon as possible, but not until it had been amputated at the first joint.  The job was performed as neatly as though done by a surgeon.</p>
                            <p>General Manager Clarkson has been assured that fully 2,000 Iowa Knights of Pythias will participate in the celebration tomorrow.  The Iowa grand lodge will meet in Council Bluffs Wednesday with a prospective membership of 1,200 delegates, and it is expected that several hundred additional members of the various subordinate lodges will improve the opportunity to see the exposition and benefit by the low railroad rate.</p>
                            <p>September 28 has been designated by the management as Swedish-American day and local Swedes are making elaborate arrangements for a big celebration.  They expect to mobilize several thousand visitors of their nationality on the grounds, and chorus singing by the various singing societies will be a notable feature of the program.  The scheme is being actively promoted by Rev. Elving, editor of the Swedish Journal of this city, and Prof. Hill of Wahoo.</p>
                            <p>The interest that has been taken in the secret society days that have already been scheduled on the exposition grounds has aroused a general demand for recognition from the remaining orders.  The Ancient Order of United Workmen is now arranging to give a big demonstration October 18, and the members are already working up interest in Nebraska and adjacent states with a view to securing a big representation.  There is considerable rivalry among the different organizations as to which shall make the most imposing demonstration, and these occasions promise to be among the most interesting events of the next three months.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>There was trouble in the camp of the redskin yesterday when Lo, the poor Indian, bumped up against one of the ailments of the paleface.  It was <choice><sic>nothnig</sic><corr>nothing</corr></choice> serious, but it was interesting while it lasted.  Rain-in-the-Face had an attack of thunder-in-the-stomach, and as the energetic cramps began to get in their ornamental scroll work, Rain-in-the-Face was the most disconsolate Indian that ever drifted off the reservation.  Captain Mercer wanted him to go to the hospital for treatment, but the suffering red man stood on his inherent rights and refused to go.  He had learned what the white man's sickness was, and he positively balked on going up against the unknown terrors of their remedies.</p>
                            <p>Persuasion and argument were unavailing, and when it became apparent that the only way to get the Indian to the hospital would be to rope him like a steer and carry him, a wise man suggested that the doctor could be called to the camp.  This was done, and a quantity of pain-killing fluid was smuggled inside the aborigine's anatomy.  It worked like a charm, and henceforth, when Indians are on the sick list, the hospital doctors will treat them in the camp, this arrangement having been made yesterday by Captain Mercer.</p>

                            <p>Arrangements are being made to do away with the constant friction that has resulted from the Manderson street gates.  Manager Kirkendall of the buildings and grounds department stated yesterday that he intended to provide all the residents within the inclosed strips on either side of Twentieth street, who were entitled to permits, with the necessary cards, so that they would have no trouble in passing through.  He said that many of the parties who were complaining had not called on him for passes, but he hoped to get everything satisfactorily adjusted, although he could not be expected to issue passes by telephone.  He stated further that orders had been given that parties who were going to the drug store or after a doctor should be allowed to pass, whether they had passes or not.  They will be required to leave their name and address, so that, in case of any attempted abuse of the privilege, the department would have the necessary record for government of subsequent action.</p>
                            <p>The life boat for which the life-saving crew has been waiting for the last two weeks arrived yesterday, and was transferred to its station.  It will be launched this morning, and it is expected that the first exhibition on the lagoon will be given tomorrow.  The boat is one that belongs to the regular service, and was brought from Grand Haven, Mich.</p>

The executive committee has decided to furnish the necessary space and power free for the purpose, together with passes for twenty-four pupils, to run the machinery and make it a live exhibit.  It now devolves on the board of education to provide for the transfer of the necessary machinery and equipment from the high school to the grounds and provide the material for the young workers to operate on.  The board of county commissioners has already set aside $300 to assist in the matter.</p>
                            <p>Edgar S. Bronson, one of the proprietors of the Trenton, Mo., Tribune, arrived yesterday with a party of thirty-five in a special car over the Pittsburg &amp; Gulf, and will remain a week, taking in the exposition.  The trip is the result of a voting contest gotten up by the Tribune the first of the year, a popular ballot being taken to decide who was the most popular young lady in Grundy county, the paper offering a prize of a trip to Omaha and a week's stay at the exposition, with all expenses paid.  The contest closed June 1, and the winner was Miss Emma Wilson of Trenton.  The party consists of a number of the most prominent people of Trenton and Grundy county.  With them is Mr. Lea M. Richards of the Tribune staff.  Mr. Bronson's partner, C. D. Morris, was here some time ago as the advance agent for the Northwest Missouri Press association, which subsequently paid the exposition a visit, and went home to write glowing stories of the beauties of the big show for the information of their readers.</p>

                            <p>In recognition of the "fugitiveness" of time, the exposition management last night turned on the electric lights at 8 o'clock, instead of 8:30, which has heretofore been the hour.</p>
                            <p>The investigating committee has taken up the music question, and is inquiring into the charges that have been made regarding the procedure in the engagement of artists, and the manner of placing this part of the work in the hands of Miss Jula Officer, with permission to collect a commission from the artists engaged.</p>
                            <p>The members of Phinney's band were the guests of Mrs. Bowser at an informal lunch at the Nebraska Sod House at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon.  It was a sort of farewell testimonial, as the band concludes its engagement here tomorrow night.  The same courtesy was accorded the Marine band just prior to its departure.  Coffee, gingerbread and milk were served, and the bandsmen enjoyed it more than they would a more pretentious spread.</p>
                            <p>The telephone company has completed the installation of its new switchboard in the Machinery and Electricity building, and new instruments are being placed at the various points on the grounds where subscribers are located.  Under the new system there is no crank to twist, the mere act of removing the telephone from the hook signaling central, who is similarly notified when the conversation is concluded by the hanging up of the telephone.  All of the telephones on the grounds will be connected with this switchboard.</p>
                            <p>Clinton Boyden, an inquiring youngster of 11 years of age, could not satisfactorily understand the workings of a bicycle sprocket wheel in the Manufactures building yesterday afternoon and inserted his finger between the chain and the wheel.  The finger is now a little shorter than it really ought to be, and the nail is being preserved with the other relics of the campaign at the Emergency hospital.</p>

                            <p>The spectacular number "From Battlefield to Fireside," which has created a furore on its previous presentations, will be repeated on the Grand Plaza tonight for the last time.  The piece has caused more comment and drawn more people to the grounds than any other musical feature which has yet been introduced.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AUDITORIUM OPENING.</head>
                            <p>The formal opening of the Auditorium organ, which was arranged for Thursday night of this week and then postponed, has been finally settled.  It will take place on Thursday night, as originally planned, rain or shine.  It will be attractive for several reasons, first because the admission fee has been placed at 25 cents to the grounds, and 15 cents to the Auditorium.  Children will be admitted to the Auditorium for 10 cents.  The organist will be Mr. Harrison Wild of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>The afternoon concerts are now being given at the Government building, owing to the attraction of the exhibitions by the United States life saving service.  Tomorrow, however, will be an exception, as the concert will be given at the Iowa building at 2:30 p. m.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday's attendance was the smallest Sunday crowd that the exposition has seen in a month, the 50-cent rate being in effect.  The gate receipts hold up, however, as one admission went twice as far, but the grounds looked deserted.  The consensus of opinion on the admission question now favors a straight 25 cent evening rate after 6 o'clock, closing all the exhibit buildings at that hour.  In some quarters this is coupled with an expression favoring the closing of the grounds on Sunday on the theory that the low evening rate would leave Sunday "a frost," even at an equally low figure.  The reduced rate idea is gaining new adherents every day in all quarters, both inside and outside the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Last week more than 15,000 people visited the Streets of All Nations, and they were all so delighted with the Street performances that nine-tenths of them went into the theater, where one of the best shows ever given on a Midway is seen.  Among the many clever and proficient dancers on the stage none received more vigorous applause than popular La Belle Fatma, who executed for the first time in Omaha the sword war dance, which is very sensational and exciting.  Mr. Akoun promises that additions will be made to his show which will include the attractions in his show the Streets of India, now at Coney Island, under the management of Victor Roditi, one of the most prominent showmen in the country.  Mr. Akoun will leave this week for San Francisco, to complete arrangements for a midwinter fair.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Cyclists Prepare for Large Number of Visitors.</head>
                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi exposition management designated Monday, August 15, as Wheelmen's day, and local wheelmen are preparing to entertain their guests in a royal manner.  Arrangements have been made for a grand bicycle parade on the exposition grounds at 7 o'clock in the evening, after which wheels will be checked and the bicyclists will take in the Midway.  Almost all of the concessionaires have cut the price of admission to their different shows for the wheelmen, who must be identified by a badge that will be given to those who enter the grounds with wheels, by the gatekeepers.</p>
                            <p>Chief Consul D. J. O'Brien of the League of American Wheelmen, one of the most hospitable league officials in the country, has charge of the plans for entertainment, and cyclists who attend on this occasion will not be apt to soon forget their reception.  Visiting wheelmen are expected from Colorado, North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas, Nebraska and from eastern states as well.</p>
                            <p>There is to be a big gathering of wheelmen at the National league meet in Indianapolis during the week of August 8, and many wheelmen will come direct from there to attend the Wheelmen's day celebration.  Denver is expected to send an even 100, as a Trans-Mississippi Wheelmen's club was organized there early this spring, and has been making great preparations for this day.  The boys are expecting to remain during the entire week of August 15, and have engaged quarters at one of the leading hotels, where they will hold a reception for the local and other visiting wheelmen.  Council Bluffs, Ia., will send over 200 bikers, while Kansas City, Sioux City, Minneapolis, St. Paul, St. Louis, Lincoln, St. Joseph, Des Moines, Burlington and Topeka will send large delegations.</p>
                            <p>Local bicycle dealers are making preparations to put gorgeously decorated floats in the parade, and the wheelman who has the best decorated wheel in line will be awarded a handsome prize.  Teddy Edwards, the well-known eastern century rider, who has covered 100 miles each day since January 1 of this year, will undoubtedly be here, and, as he intends to ride 100 miles each day during 1898, if he comes to Omaha for Wheelmen's day, visitors will doubtless have the opportunity of seeing him do his 100 miles upon the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Feature of Kansas City Day That Was Attractive.</head>
                            <p>The fire display given by the A. L. Due company north of West Midway Saturday night was one of the most gorgeous witnessed for a long time, and the Kansas City visitors and thousands of other people from various parts of the country encored with great enthusiasm every effect.</p>
                            <p>Long before the hour for the display to begin throngs of people poured into every avenue leading from West Midway to the scene of the illumination and the stream of humanity was immense.  Fred Cummins, seat concessionaire, and his assistants cared for them in splendid style and everyone was soon comfortably located.  At 9 o'clock the signal was given and for nearly an hour the grand entertainment went on.  The program was as follows:</p>
                            <p>Display began with three large salute shells, which could be heard for miles.</p>
                            <p>"Welcome Kansas City."</p>
                            <p>Firing extra heavy magnesium shells.</p>
                            <p>Mammoth revolving planets undergoing mechanical changes in fire.</p>
                            <p>Flight of floating star rockets.</p>
                            <p>Revolving fountains on the lake, filling the entire lake with fire.</p>
                            <p>A. L. Due's grand bouquet of variegated colors.</p>
                            <p>Flight of silver snakes.</p>
                            <p>Ascension of mammoth umbrella.</p>
                            <p>Mechanical device, the only one of its kind in the country, jeweled fan with revolving stars.</p>
                            <p>Double shells, giving two explosions in midair with magnesium effects.</p>
                            <p>Mechanical "girl acrobat," performing on large ball of fire running 300 feet in midair.</p>
                            <p>Ascension of A. L. Due's extra large forty-five inch shells, containing 10,000 stars each, with all the colors of the rainbow.</p>
                            <p>Flight of flying doves, flying to and fro across the lake.</p>
                            <p>A mammoth portrait of J. M. Jones, mayor of Kansas city, surmounted with a floral wreath of variegated colors.</p>
                            <p>Concluding with a grand finale bombardment of thousands of rockets, shells, candles, etc., and "good night" in large letters of many colors.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Several Thousand of Them Contribute to Make Their Day One of the Best in the Exposition's History.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Kansas City was here.  It came <del>in large numbers</del><add>upwards of 1200 of them</add>, and they were easily to be distinguished by the badges which suggest something about their town, and express a demand to be furnished ocular evidence, which demand was readily complied with.  They brought a band with them, and while the delegation is from a southern state, the band is made up of colored musicians, and furnished a quality of music which the Missourians were pleased to hear.  The cream of the metropolis on the Kaw has temporarily been transferred to Omaha, and the visitors have been extended the glad hand on all sides since their arrival in the city, and for the day the people here seem to be willing to admit <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>The visitors occupied three special trains, besides forcing the railroad companies to add several cars to their regular trains plying between the two cities.  The program for meeting the trains was marred a trifle by their arrival about an hour ahead of the scheduled time, but the reception committees reached the depot before the passengers had dispersed, and straightway sought to make up for its delay by increased efforts to make our neighbors feel at home.  The official portion of them was taken to the Millard, where the members were regaled and refreshed, after their all night journey, and made acquainted with the representatives of the city and of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The bulk of the visitors represent the business men and citizens generally of Kansas City, with large delegations from the Manufacturers' association, Board of Trade, Commercial club, and Live Stock exchange, while a roll call of the roster of city officials would find few failing to respond to their names.  The following officials of the city are present:</p>
                            <p>C. S. Curry, city clerk; R. B. Middlebrook, counsellor; Hans Lund, comptroller; J. Scott Harrison, jr., treasurer; Amos R. Cecil, auditor; A. Wallace Love, superintendent of buildings; Henry Sieben, plumbing inspector; A. Van Brunt, park commissioner; Clarence McIlroy, clerk in city clerk's office; William Woolf, deputy license inspector; J. R. Kuickley, county recorder's office.</p>
                            <p>Members of Upper House&#8212;A. F. Butt, John E. Lach, Herman M. Gerhart, C. N. Munson, P. S. Brown, jr., William Clough, sergeant-at-arms.</p>
                            <p>Members of Lower House&#8212;John Moran, Jesse L. Jewell, Olans Swanson, James O. Beroth, John P. Lynch, Lewis B. Sawyer, William H. Otto, Speaker A. D. Burrows, John F. Wiedenmann, John Thomas, sergeant-at-arms.</p>
                            <p>The newspaper men in the party are, Walter Sanford of the Star, J. Irwin of the Journal, Frank Miarquard of the Times, J. P. Britt of the World and Arthur Cain of the Star.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Thomas T. Crittenden and wife, Hugh J. McCowan of the Barber Asphalt company and Henry R. Carson of Chicago, representing the same company, and Judge J. H. Austin are also in the party.</p>

                            <p>The representatives of the Manufacturers' association carried grass linen parasols, on which was inscribed the name of the organization.  There were the hustlers of the crowd, and immediately upon entering the lobby of the hotel one was impressed with the feeling that some one from Kansas City was near by.  They were modest in general, however, and generous.  They complimented the appearance of Omaha, and expressed pleasure with the courtesy shown them.  They said the first impression of the two cities would be to leave the belief that Omaha is larger than Kansas City, while <del>least one representative of Omaha's city that</del> after an investigation the opposite would be shown to be true.</p>
                            <p>Blackman's Midland band (colored), D. E. Blackman, leader, donned its white coats, and gave a short concert while the members of the delegation secured their breakfast and made ready to go out to the exposition.  It was 10 o'clock before they were ready to make the start.  Carriages had been secured for the use of the official representatives of Kansas City, and into these the visitors were hurried, each carriage containing at they of course expected to no one to doubt but government, to act as guide.  There were fifteen of the carriages.  In the first one Mr. and Mrs. Crittenden and Mayor Moores, and in the second President Wattles of the exposition pointed out the places of interest to the other occupants.  The line, headed by Sergeant Iler and Policeman Ronk and Gibbon, mounted, drove from the Millard to Farnam street, west on Farnam to Fifteenth, north on Fifteen to Douglas, west on Douglas to Sixteenth and north on Sixteenth to the exposition grounds, where the formal ceremonies of the day were to take place.</p>
                            <p>The official reception and honors were confined to the representatives of the Kansas City municipal government, as the delegation from the south was too large to be handled in a body.  The balance of the visitors soon dispersed themselves over the city after their arrival, and many of them lost no time in getting out to the grounds.  The major portion of them returned home last evening, but the members of the city government will remain until Sunday evening, returning on one of the regular trains.</p>

                            <p>The Kansas City branch of the Burlington brought in its regular train with ten well filled coaches, and in addition had a special train made up of eight Pullmans, bringing at least 1,000 excursionists.  The Port Arthur had a special train composed of three Pullmans and five coaches, which were filled to full capacity.  Its regular morning train was larger than usual also, and swelled the number of Missourians the road carried to 800 or 900.  The Missouri Pacific had a special train of six Pullmans and several coaches fun as a section of its train, No. 1, and the regular train was larger than it ordinarily is by several cars, and every car well filled.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Anticipating a favorable outcome of the peace negotiations now in progress between Spain and the United States, the exposition management is preparing for a grand peace demonstration which will be held as soon after the war is officially ended as the necessary preliminaries can be arranged.  It has been suggested that it is eminently fitting that the peaceful solution of the difficulties now pending should be celebrated by a big jollification at the Transmississippi Exposition, which is essentially representative of the arts and pursuits of peace.  With this idea in view it is proposed to make the demonstration one of the biggest features of the exposition and it will occur as soon as possible after the conclusion of the war is assured.</p>
                            <p>The plans for the celebration have not been fully determined, but it has been decided that a vigorous effort will be made to secure the presence of President McKinley and of as many other representatives of the national administration as possible.  A number of speakers of national reputation will be invited to make addresses and there will be a mammoth parade, which will include all the features of the exposition and possibly an entire representation of local organizations and secret societies.  The celebration will conclude with a big display of fireworks in the evening and other interesting features will probably be added before the plans are completed.</p>
                            <p>In the same connection it is proposed to recognize the return of the volunteers with a big public demonstration in case they are sent home before the exposition closes.  This will also be an exposition feature and although it is considered doubtful if any of the Nebraska regiments are mustered out before November 1 the management will be ready to give them a rousing reception if the occasion presents itself.</p>

                            <p>In spite of the fact that two of the biggest days of last week were largely discounted by rain, the attendance was a decided improvement on that of any previous week.  There was no single day that compared with either the opening day or July 4, but there was a steady inflow of out-of-town people that swelled the aggregate to unprecedented proportions.  The total attendance at the exposition up to date is 699,800 and of these fully 100,000 came through the gates during the last seven days.  Friday was the banner day, with nearly 22,000 admissions, with Indian day a close second.  The exact figures are Sunday, 9,482; Monday, 8,215; Tuesday, 16,462; Wednesday, 12,945; Thursday, 19,648; Friday, 21,441; Saturday (estimated), 12,000; total, 100,193.</p>
                            <p>It had been expected that yesterday would be an even bigger day in point of attendance than those preceding, but the heavy rain that fell in the early morning and the clouds that continued to threaten kept the crowd down to average dimensions.  Aside from the ceremonies that attended the reception and entertainment of the Kansas City visitors the repetition of the floral <unclear reason="torn"/>

                            the day.  This was far from showing the full effect of the magnificent spectacle, but it was sufficient to give the visitors a vivid impression of what it was when the full strength of the demonstration was in line.  The ominous weather induced the bulk of the participants to remain at home, and only thirteen of the half hundred equipages that moved in the cavalcade of the previous day were in evidence at 4 o'clock.  These waited for half an hour for some belated participant to arrive and break the unfortunate number, but none appeared and the pageant moved over practically the same route, headed by a squad of police and Phinney's band.  Those who were sufficiently patriotic to bring out their vehicles for the second time were:  Mrs. Gurdon W. Wattles, Miss Lynn Curtis, Miss Mae Mount, Miss Anna Shiverick, Mrs. H. T. Clarke, Mrs. C. J. Barber, Mrs. J. E. Baum, Mrs. F. P. Kirkendall, Mrs. Ed Maurer, Mrs. J. H. Evans, Mrs. Howard Baldrige, Miss Nellie Bennett and Miss Elizabeth Allen.</p>
                            <p>The grounds will be opened at 1 o'clock this afternoon, but owing to the failure to secure a quorum of the Board of Directors Friday, the rate of admission will remain at 50 cents.  Phinney's band will give its usual concerts at 3 and 7:30 o'clock and the other attractions of the show will remain as usual.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p><del>Upwards of 1,000</del> Kansas City visitors helped to enliven the day at the exposition grounds and most of them will remain over Sunday to complete their inspection of the Transmississippi show.  They represented a large proportion of the official and commercial life of the big city on the Kaw and with liberal assistance from their Omaha hosts they crowded the day and evening full of unqualified enjoyment.  Their badges bore the suggestive motto, "You Will Have to Show Me," and the people who wore them constituted one of the liveliest and most enthusiastic crowds that has yet visited the exposition.  They came in during the morning on three different routes and by the time when the exercises of the day were scheduled most of them had found their way to the grounds and impressed the local visitors with the fact that they were in town.</p>
                            <p>The official members of the party were a little late in getting out and it was a little after 11 o'clock when they appeared at the Auditorium.  They were escorted to the stage by President Wattles of the exposition association, Mayor Moores and other city officials while the band played a medley of popular airs and the crowd poured in and partially filled the building.  A few minutes later the Manufacturers' association of Kansas City, headed by Blackman's band, arrived at the grounds and the band was escorted to a place on the stage.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Welcomed to Omaha.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles called the crowd to order and introduced Mayor Frank E. Moores, who welcomed the visitors in behalf of the city.  He assured them that this is no perfunctory duty.  At this time when the great west is making this magnificent exposition of its resources it is eminently <choice><sic>fittting</sic><corr>fitting</corr></choice> that the good fellowship and hospitality, which was no less a product of the west, should not be lacking.  The west had produced Lincoln, whose motto was "Malice toward none and charity toward all."  It had produced Grant, whose magnanimous conduct at Appomattox had done so much to relieve the acerbities of civil war.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores called attention to the fact that Omaha and Kansas City occupied a very similar position in regard to the commercial field in the west.  But this is no reason why their competition should not be of the friendliest character.  Their interests are in the main identical.  What brings benefit to one must in some degree assist the other.  In conclusion he presented Acting Mayor A. D. Burrows with the huge golden keys which represented the liberty of the city.</p>
                            <p>In behalf of Mayor Jones, who was unable to be present, Mr. Burrows expressed the appreciation of the visitors at the very hospitable reception that had greeted them, and was succeeded by ex-Governor Crittenden of Missouri, who responded in behalf of the people of his state.  The speaker declared that they had stopped at the gates this morning and declared with admiration and gratification, "Behold, a greater than Chicago."  They would return home to proclaim the beauties of the exposition and the hospitality of the city and send the rest of their inhabitants to descend on Omaha like a flight of locusts.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Come to Cheer Us On.</head>
                            <p>Continuing Governor Crittenden declared that they had come to pluck no flowers, but to add brighter colors to our wreaths.  They came from a sister city and they were animated by only one feeling and that to do honor to an enterprise that honored the whole west.  There is no hatred towards Omaha in Kansas City.  They recognized in Omaha a great and energetic city and have no desire to rob it of any of the laurels is has won.  "All hail to Omaha" is the utterance of Kansas City, Missouri, and the great west of which we are all a part, and all shared the expectation that the exposition would bring an added measure of prosperity to the whole west.</p>
                            <p>Referring to Kansas City, the speaker sketched a brief statistical review of its business resources and superior advantages, and declared that if he had access to similar data in regard to Omaha he would speak of it with the same pride.  Omaha has accomplished what no other city dared to undertake and its success has surprised everyone, except itself.</p>
                            <p>Governor Crittenden's address was followed by a selection by Blackman's band and a short address by President Wattles, who said that it was especially appropriate that the first municipal day at the exposition should be celebrated by Kansas City.  No city ever won commercial supremacy by tearing down the prestige of another city.  The interests of the two municipalities were identical.  They were both developments of the pioneer life of the early west.  The future of both depended on the continued growth and prosperity of the same territory.  This neighborly visit was only one of the evidences of good will and encouragement that had been received from Kansas City during the progress of the exposition.  The great enterprise stood like a beacon light and commanded the attention of the world.  That such results could be accomplished in the midst of financial embarrassments by a people burdened by crop failures and evil reports, was the greatest marvel of modern times.  It was an exposition of pluck and energy and enterprise that had never been equaled.</p>
                            <p>After the conclusion of the formal celebration the crowd proceeded to distribute itself over the grounds and take in the show from the Midway to the Arch of States.  During the afternoon a delegation headed by Blackman's band serenaded most of the Midway resorts and were hospitably entertained.  The <del>ghost of yesterday's</del><add><note type="handwritten">unremoved Flower Parade</note></add> flower parade attracted the bulk of the visitors and in the evening they made a round of the Midway that left nothing to complain of being slighted.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday was uneventful at the Indian congress.  The rain of the early morning drenched the occupants of the village and dampened the occupants of the village and dampened their bedding and clothing.  At the same time it dampened their ardor, especially those who come from Arizona and New Mexico, where it is never supposed to rain.</p>
                            <p>There are a lot of Indians upon the grounds who when at home reside in a country that is as dry as a powder horn, and it is seldom that they ever see water except in the rivers and streams.  The downpour of Saturday morning was something new to them and consequently they were unprepared for anything of the kind.  In the morning these Indians arose at the usual hour and seeing the sky overcast with clouds concluded that it meant trouble.  They went back into their wickiups and prepared for the worst.  The worst, however, did not come, but instead a rain did come and their habitations leaked like so many sieves.</p>

One could not throw himself under the wheels because it can be stopped instantly at any time, and the steering apparatus is so perfect that the motorman can dodge an object like a bird.

                            <div3>
                            <p>Of all the interesting exhibits in the Transportation building at the Transmississippi Exposition there is none that attracts more general attention, or is viewed with as great affection and reverence as the old "Lincoln car."  None of the visitors to the Transportation building go away without gazing at the historic relic for some time with an evident affectionate interest and very few look at it save with uncovered heads.</p>
                            <p>Although the car is now in a dilapidated condition and plainly shows that it has been abandoned to the cold storms of winter and the sun's hot rays in summer for too many years, it is still the car that was used to bear the remains of President Lincoln from Washington to Springfield, Ill., for interment.  Time has made sad changes within and without.  From a beautifully decorated exterior its sides are changed to a lot of cracked and weatherbeaten boards.  The glass in the windows, the brass railings of the platforms, the union shield and other decorations are all gone.  Inside the several compartments and fine furnishings have been removed.  The sofa and chairs are gone, but it is the old Lincoln car, what is left of it, a decaying hulk of its once honored self, and though left obscure and neglected until the opening of the exposition, the visitor who sees it recognizes in it a national treasure of incomparable value and rich association and does well to take off his hat to it.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Why the Car Was Built.</head>
                            <p>There have been articles descriptive of the old Lincoln car written and published, especially since the World's fair, at which it was proposed to exhibit the car.  In all of these articles more or less space is devoted to the description of the armor-plate that is supposed by many to have lined the car, and many tales are related of the use of the car to convey President Lincoln to Virginia during the war that he might visit the Army of the Potomac.  As a matter of fact the car was not lined with sheet iron at all and it never made a trip to the front during the civil war.  The first time it was ever used was to bear the remains of President Lincoln, with those of his son, which had been disinterred, from Washington, D. C., to Springfield, Ill.</p>
                            <p>Authority for these statements, which so flatly refute the stories about the use of the car in war time, is obtained from W. H. H. Price of Atlanta, Ga., foreman of car repairs of the Southern railway there.  It was he who had charge of the building of the car from the time it was begun until it was finally completed for President Lincoln, shortly before his assassination.  At that time Mr. Price was foreman of the car shops at Alexandria, Va.  In searching for the true history of the Lincoln car some time ago a Bee reporter discovered a friend of Mr. Price employed in the Union Pacific shops in this city.  A correspondence with the man who built the Lincoln care followed and from him were obtained facts that controvert the heretofore accepted history of the national relic.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Letter from Its Builder.</head>
                            <p>The following is a letter on this subject to The Bee from Mr. Price, under the date of February 19, 1897:</p>
                            <p>In reply to yours of the 13th inst. I would say that I know that I am the only living man that had anything to do with managing the building of President Lincoln's private car.  I was foreman at one of the car shops at Alexandria, Va., under B. P. Lamason, superintendent car department, United States Military railroad of Virginia, and as foreman had charge of building the car from start to finish.  The work was begun in November, 1863, and was finished in February, 1865.</p>
                            <p>Some time during the year 1863 Mr. Lamason conceived the idea or received orders to build a private car for the use of the president.  The car was designed for the general use of the president, and not exclusively for the purpose of conveying him to an from the front, as is generally supposed; neither was the car cased inside with iron, as has been stated by some writers.</p>
                            <p>The car was completed but a short time before the assassination of the president.  On the day the president was assassinated General J. H. Devereaux, superintendent of transportation, and Mr. Lamason were awaiting a reply to an invitation sent the president to take a ride in the car the next day, April 15, 1865.  The first trip it ever made was to bear President Lincoln's lifeless remains, with those of his son, which <unclear reason="torn"/> from Washington to <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>After the car had been finished it was photographed by the government photographer.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Design of the Car.</head>
                            <p>In design of framing the car was similar to those in use on the Pennsylvania railroad, was forty-two feet long inside and had raised roof with circular ends.  The inside of the car was upholstered on sides and ends from the seat rail to the head lining, and was divided into three compartments, viz., drawing room, parlor and stateroom, the latter being in center of the car.  The drawing room and parlor were connected by an aisle extending along the wall inside of the car, and in the drawing room end a saloon was placed.  The upper deck was painted a zinc white, with coat of arms of the different states in the panels.</p>
                            <p>The car was originally planned to run on two trucks, but after it was framed and well under way Mr. Lamason changed his mind and decided to mount it on four trucks, which necessitated changing the bolsters and considerable other work.  The two main bolsters were Ambrose Word's patent, and the ends of the bolster truss rods projected through the sides of the car and were covered by brass-capped nuts, as shown in the cut.  Four sub-bolsters were also added to receive the eight side bearings with slotted centers, as described by the sketch.</p>
                            <p>Each two trucks were connected by means of a truss with main center plate in center.  There were four guide center plates, with curved slots, one on each sub-bolster and one on each truck and two side bearings made of spring steel and rubber.</p>
                            <p>The spread of trucks was four feet ten inches; wheels, thirty-three inches, cast iron, with broad tread.  The wheels were made by the Union car wheel works of Jersey City, N. J., of the W. W. Snow patent.  Mr. Snow is at present general manager of the Ramapo Wheel and Foundry company of Ramapo, N. Y.  The springs of the truck bolsters were hung on old style long hangers, no sand board, but bottom of hangers tied with U-shaped under-rods.</p>
                            <p>No equalizing bar was used, the elliptic springs being placed on top of oil boxes.  The pedestals were cast iron, of a pattern so elaborate as to be difficult to describe. Mr. Lamason having spent weeks in designing them.</p>
                            <p>The outside of the car was painted a rich chocolate brown and polished with oil and rotten stone with the bare hand.  In the oval panel on side of car was painted the United States coat of arms and in the center of panel above coat of arms in small gold letters, placed in a circle, were the words "United States."  The car was ornamented in gold, but had neither number nor name except as just described.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lamason had personal charge of the car in the funeral train, and, as the running gear was so different from cars then in use, it was attended by one man, having with him a supply of duplicate parts, tools, etc., to facilitate repairs in case of accident.</p>
                            <p>When the car was returned to Alexandria it was still draped in black crape, which was removed, carefully boxed and sent to the Treasury department.  The writer had the honor of attending personally to this work, and, in spite of orders to the contrary, a small portion of the drapery was secured, which he still has in his possession, as well as a block of wood from the catafalque on which rested the body of the dead president.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Bought by Sidney Dillon.</head>
                            <p>Just after the close of the war the government put a great amount of its railway material that had been used in the prosecution of the war into the hands of an auction firm in Cincinnati, and among it was the Lincoln car.  Sidney Dillon, who was then at the head of the Union Pacific affairs, was directly responsible for its purchase.  For a long time after its arrival in Omaha the car was a great curiosity both on account of its connection with the martyr president and also for the reason that it was then considered the finest railway coach that had ever been constructed, and many thousands of people visited the shops for the purpose of seeing it.</p>
                            <p>Late in 1892 a company of men from New York sent an agent to Omaha with a view of negotiating a purchase of the car, intending to exhibit it at the World's fair.  Satisfactory terms could not be made, and the project was abandoned.  The agent desired to have proof of the authenticity of the car from the railway officials, and Mr. I. H. Condon, for many years master mechanic of the Union Pacific railway, in a lengthy let-letter on the subject, said:</p>
                            <p>"The famous car was brought to Omaha in 1866, and was purchased for the Union Pacific by T. C. Durant.  Sidney Dillon manifested great interest in the car in the early days of the road.  I was in charge of the locomotive department of the Great Western railroad of Illinois, at Springfield, during the war, and was there at the time President Lincoln's remains were brought there.  The car had been used as a funeral car, and stood in the railroad yards during the time that Lincoln's body lay in state in the capitol building, and we had an opportunity of examining it closely.  I remember identifying it as the same car when it came here in 1866.  When first brought to Omaha it was used as a private car by the directors, but on account of its extreme weight and the manner in which it was mounted, it rode so poorly that they soon abandoned it.  I have been over the road with Mr. Dillon in the Lincoln car, and heard him speak of <unclear reason="torn"/> the president used were brought to Springfield.  <unclear reason="torn"/>Clark, now president of the Union Pacific, stated to me a good many years ago that Mr. Dillon desired some of the furniture of the car taken out and sent to New York, and I saw that his request was carried out."</p>
                            <p>The car was built as nearly as possible to suit Mr. Lincoln's idea, and was so peculiar in construction as to give it individual characteristics.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">On the Down Grade.</head>
                            <p>In 1870 the car was sold to the Colorado Central at the time of the construction of the latter line to Golden, Colo.  The car was used for a number of years between Denver and Golden as a passenger coach.  The seats of the car then ran sideways along the entire length of the car, and there is said to have been presented some jolly scenes of western sociability as the old car was pulled along at a low rate of speed between the two western towns, the travelers swapping yarns and other things with their fellow tourists across the aisle.</p>
                            <p>In a few years, after the car had served its usefulness as a passenger coach on the Colorado line, it was declared to be a back number so far as passenger equipment was concerned, and was then converted into a construction car.  For several years it carried gangs of workmen along the line, was used by them between camps and at nights, and again saw a bit of pioneer railroad life in the west, when the west was really wild.  As is the case with all construction cars this one received some pretty hard knocks.  Young engineers and their workmen are not over fond of taking good care of their construction cars.  But it was always known as the "Lincoln car."  In 1878 the Colorado Central was absorbed by the Union Pacific system.  It was used for a time as a construction car on the Union Pacific, but it has spent most of its time since standing unprotected in the shop yards at Omaha.  At one time a shed was erected over it and many visitors inspected it.</p>
                            <p>Since 1878 several attempts have been made to have the car restored to its original condition but they have all failed.  W. H. H. Price, the foreman who had charge of the construction of the car, had a plan for restoring the car to a condition very similar to its original state, but never succeeded in obtaining the co-operation of those whose aid was necessary.  Some of the most interesting features of the car are still in Omaha, but they are not exhibited with it.  The small wooden panels, on which are painted the coats-of-arms of the states belonging to the union in 1865, are well preserved, and are kept in the model room of the Union Pacific shops here.  A sofa, reclining chair and several smaller chairs are in the offices of the higher officials.  Other articles of furniture of the car were removed to New York by order of Sidney Dillon, a former president of the road.</p>

                            <p>The exhibitors in the Agricultural building are up in arms and have a protest against the closing of the building at 6 o'clock.  They contend that thousands of the people who visit the exposition are those who are not upon the grounds during the day and that for this reason they should be given some consideration.  They have signed a petition which will be presented to the exposition management, asking that the building to be kept open until the gates close.</p>

                            the exposition and of the Omaha Commercial club was the recommendation of a set of lower rates to the Western Passenger association.  To consider this recommendation a special meeting of the Western Passenger association has been called for Chicago on Wednesday, August 10.  As the lines entering this city constitute the bulk of power of the Western Passenger association it is confidently believed that their recommendation will be accepted and their suggestions as to low rates be adopted.</p>
                            <p>Two sessions on the subject of reduced rates to the exposition were held here yesterday.  The morning session was held in the Administration Arch on the exposition grounds and representatives of the several interests mentioned were present.  The afternoon session was held in the Service building and was a closed session of the general passenger agents of the Omaha terminal lines.</p>
                            <p>Previous to the morning meeting the visiting railroaders met the local passenger men at the Elkhorn headquarters and hurriedly went over the local rate situation.  Then the party adjourned to the exposition grounds, where the conference was called to order shortly after 11 o'clock.  In addition to the members of the exposition executive committee there were present Herman Kountze, C. S. Montgomery, J. E. Baum and the following general passenger agents: P. S. Eustis and John Francis of the Burlington, Heafford of the Milwaukee, Lomax of the Union Pacific, Buchanan of the Elkhorn, and Harry C. Orr of the Port Arthur Route, Assistant General Passenger Agents MacLeod of the Rock Island, Payne of the Missouri Pacific, Cairnes of the Northwestern and Hutchison of the Union Pacific; Louis Jackson, industrial agent, and Fred A. Nash, general western agent, of the Milwaukee; B. D. Caldwell, chairman, and T. W. Lee, joint agent of the Western Passenger association.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Arguments for Lower Rates.</head>
                            <p>The arguments in favor of a reduction in rates to Omaha on account of the exposition were made by Edward Rosewater, Herman Kountze and J. E. Baum.  All of them spoke of the benefits to be derived, not only by the exposition and Omaha, but the western country as a whole, through the medium of reduced rates during the remainder of the exposition.  Mr. Rosewater made an especial plea for reduced rates from more remote points than had yet been granted low rates to the exposition.  The request of the joint committee of the exposition directors and of the Omaha Commercial club was formulated and presented as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Western Passenger association lines are requested to make the following rates to the exposition:</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;Daily one fare round trip from all points, fifteen days limit.</p>
                            <p>Second&#8212;State and city days 1 cent per mile from all points round trip, limit ten days.</p>
                            <p>Third&#8212;Local excursion trains from points within 200 miles in morning and back at night, ½ cent per mile.  Excursion beyond 200 miles limit to be increased based on conditions.</p>
                            <p>Fourth&#8212;Red letter days from points within 200 miles 1 cent per mile, three days limit; excess of 200 miles, limit based on conditions.</p>
                            <p>After the presentation of this request there was a general discussion in which most of those present participated.  The railroaders did not combat the arguments in favor of reduced rates, but contented themselves with an explanation of the rate situation and the difficulties in the way of conceding all that was asked for by the exposition.  The morning meeting, which was an executive session, adjourned at 2 o'clock for lunch.</p>
                            <p>In the afternoon the railroad men convened in the Service building.  They discussed the four propositions for reduced rates presented to them at the morning session.  The Omaha general passenger agents argued with their brothers for most liberal concessions.  What recommendations were agreed upon will be submitted to a general meeting of all the lines in Chicago on Wednesday.  It was voted to keep these recommendations secret until Wednesday's meeting, for fear that the premature publication of them would be prejudicial to the movement for lower rates.</p>

                            <p>After the adjournment of the afternoon meeting General Passenger Agent Francis of the B. &amp; M. said:  "The action taken this afternoon was very favorable to the exposition.  A meeting of the general association has been called for Wednesday to consider our recommendations.  What these recommendations were we think best not to make public for fear of hurting our cause."</p>
                            <p>"Do you think the other lines in the association will agree to your recommendations?"</p>
                            <p>"You bet they will.  The Omaha terminal lines will recommend liberal rates to the exposition, and their recommendations are going to go."</p>
                            <p>B. D. Caldwell, chairman of the Western Passenger association, said:  "The conference has been very favorable to the exposition.  Your committee presented some good arguments for lower rates.  The railroad men did not argue against them but explained the situation so that they might know what has to be accomplished to reduce the rates.  We are all working together on this matter, and I believe the recommendations of the Omaha terminal lines will be agreed on by all the lines in the association.  I want to say that better rates have been secured for the exposition than were granted during the first six weeks of the World's fair, and much credit for this must be given to Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation, who has worked very hard with the railroads for the best interests of the exposition."</p>
                            <p>After the adjournment of the afternoon meeting the action of the general passenger agents in recommending a line of lower rates was variously discussed among the exposition directors and members of the Commercial club.  It was agreed that the four propositions presented contained only a fair request, and the hope was expressed that all of the propositions had been recommended.  The only fear expressed was that the recommendations for better rates would not bring the desired rates into effect before September 1, whereas all who are working for the success of the big show want the reduced rates to become effective at once.</p>

                            <p>There was some consternation in passenger circles yesterday when the Milwaukee's cut to $9.25 in the Chicago rate business became known.  It was somewhat of a surprise to the passenger men of the other Omaha-Chicago lines, though John Sebastian, general passenger agent of the Rock Island system, got wind of what was coming in Omaha Thursday and that's the reason he cut his visit here short and hurried back to Chicago headquarters.</p>
                            <p>There is no doubt but the other lines will offer the same rate on Tuesday morning, when the Milwaukee puts its Chicago tickets on sale at both Omaha and Chicago.  General Passenger Agent John Francis of the B. &amp; M. last night said that the Burlington would meet the cut.  Assistant General Passenger Agent MacLeod of the Rock Island said the matter was being handled in Chicago and he had received no advices of the cut.  The Northwestern office did not receive notice of the cut either.  But it's a foregone conclusion that all the lines will put in the rate on Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>Asked where the rate war was going to bring up, Chairman Caldwell of the Western Passenger association yesterday said:  "It's pretty hard to tell.  The rate of $9.25 between Chicago and Omaha and of $8 between Chicago and St. Paul will be put into effect on Tuesday.  It is probable that the lines to St. Louis will also make a cut, but nothing has as yet been announced concerning a cut in the rates to Kansas City.  The rate of $9.25 is not only a selling rate, but is a basing rate as well and as such will necessarily affect the through transcontinental rates.  Until the rates go into effect on Tuesday it is probable that nothing will be done in the way of restoring rates to tariff."</p>

                            <p>During this week Omaha is to be given over largely to Red Men.  On Monday the advance guard of the delegations will arrive in the city, Great Incohonee Daniel of Georgia being among the prominent men of the order who will come on that day.  On Tuesday morning the St. Joseph Red Men will arrive at 11 o'clock, and from that time on every train will bring in tribes from all parts of the country.  The Tennessee delegation, which comprises 1,000 Red Men together with their friends, has not informed the local committee of the exact time they expect to reach Omaha, but they will be here in time to take part in the exercises of the 10th and end up the day with a genuine Red Men's sham battle, something which is entirely new to Omaha.  The following is the program which has been arranged for August 10:</p>

                            <p>August 11 is Tennessee Red Men's day and will be celebrated appropriately by the Red Men who come from that state, assisted by the local and visiting members of the order.  The exact program for the day has not been announced, but the chief feature will be two sham battles, one given in the morning and the other in the evening.  The Tennessee delegation has had extensive experience in giving these military spectacles and bears the reputation of giving the best sham battles of any organization in the United States.  More than 700 men completely costumed in the bright-colored uniform of the native red men will take part in the battles.  At the Nashville exposition the sham battles given by the same organization were one of the features of the exposition and on the days they were given attracted great crowds to the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The lodge rooms in the Continental block are to be the headquarters for Red Men while in the city.  The entire Continental building will be decorated appropriately in flags and bunting together with the symbols of the order, and the delegations will be escorted there as they arrive in the city and put under the care of entertainment committees.  Five information bureaus for the accommodation of Red Men have been established in different parts of the city and every effort will be made by the local tribes to render the visitors' stay in Omaha a pleasant one.</p>

                            <p>The Kansas City officials, who accompanied a big batch of Missourians to the city yesterday in celebration of Kansas City day, were "shown."  Following the morning at the exposition grounds they were <choice><sic>kidnaped</sic><corr>kidnapped</corr></choice> by the Omaha city government in the afternoon and were given the best in the way of prandial entertainment that the city could offer.  The bit of a banquet took place at the Millard hotel in the middle of the afternoon.</p>
                            <p>An excellent menu was offered for the enjoyment of the official portion of the city down the Kaw.  At its conclusion, when cigars were served, Mayor Moores once more welcomed the visitors, this time in the behalf of the city government of Omaha.  The response was made by Former Governor Crittenden, who was followed with addresses upon various topics by the following:  Speaker D. S. Burrows of the lower house of the council of Kansas City, Member C. N. Munson of the upper house, City Counsellor R. B.

                            <head type="sub">Department of Justice Shows Some Rare Old Works of Legal Lore.</head>
                            <head type="sub">PORTRAITS OF THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL</head>
                            <head type="sub">Records of Early Trials for Heresy and Treason Among the Many Articles of Historic Interest Shown.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>In the exhibit of the Department of Justice in the Government building the portraits of the attorneys general of the United States, painted in oil by the best foreign and native artists, are artistically grouped on a dark maroon background.</p>
                            <p>The beautiful figure of Justice, which ornaments the large column commanding the entrance to the exhibit, was originally designed by Major Frank Strong, U. S. A., the representative of the department on the government board.  A woman of classic features and graceful pose holds in her left hand a pair of golden scales evenly balanced.  In her right hand is an unsheathed sword.  Her eyes are blindfolded; a wreath of golden hair falls over her shoulders; her Greek robe of blue and white is draped in rich folds about her lissome form.  An effective group of American flags borne on golden tipped, arrow-headed staffs, forms a background for this emblem of justice.  At her feet is the magnificent seal of the Department of Justice held in a heavy frame of gold.  This seal is the American eagle standing on a divided shield, one part composed of the white and red stripes of our national flag, while the other is a dark blue field emblazoned with golden stars; in one claw the eagle holds an olive branch, in the other a bunch of arrows.  In letters of gold the motto "Qui pro domina justitia sequitur" holds the shield in an arc of the circle which surrounds the entire design and encloses a field in which the tints of sunrise are admirably blended.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Many Rare Old Books.</head>
                            <p>The rare old books in the cases, which are always open to the inspection of the cultured people interested in the exhibit, are a rare treat to the judges and lawyers who visit the exposition.  The Plaudits of Justinian, written in old Latin, the Frederician code, the laws of Mohamet, the state trials for heresy and high treason in Great Britain from the reign of Richard II to George III, the first edition of Blackstone published on the American continent, the charters of the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland from Charles II to William Penn and Lord Baltimore respectively, the colonial laws of the thirteen original states, are a few of the legal treasures to be seen and read for the asking.</p>
                            <p>The custodian is always there to be of service in explaining the exhibit, in translating any language contained in the books, or to point out in brief the most striking parts in the historical law papers such as the trial of the archbishop of Canterbury for high treason and heresy, the Guy Fawkes conspiracy or gunpowder plot, the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, Charles I, Sir Walter Raleigh, Earl of Essex, etc.</p>
                            <p>Major Frank Strong has just sent from Washington autograph letters of Abraham Lincoln, James Buchanan, U. S. Grant and other presidents in which they recommend pardon to criminals whose circumstances or good behavior gave reasons why justice should be tempered with mercy.  In a few days the portraits of all the chief justices of the United States and a number of the associate justices are expected.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit of the Department of Justice is not a large one, but it appeals peculiarly to the taste of cultured people.  A man cannot fail to learn many valuable things in the hour or two spent in the niche over which the emblem of justice presides.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Follow Washington's Advice.</head>
                            <p>It is considered fitting, at this exposition, conceived and carried out on a plan of increasing and diffusing knowledge among men, that there should be as one of its main attractions an exhibit from the Smithsonian institution and National museum.  Having as its motto and shield "For the Increase and Diffusion of Knowledge Among Men," this exhaustive and comprehensive exhibit will be found to the right of the main door of the Government building as you go in and is one of the most interesting features of the Government building.</p>
                            <p>When George Washington, in 1796, said: "Promote, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the increase and diffusion of knowledge; in proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion be enlightened," he had no conception of the extent to which the United States would grow or the various ways taken to diffuse knowledge.</p>
                            <p>Thirty years after an Englishman named Smithson, never having been in America, but knowing of its struggles and admiring the principles of its foundation, put this clause in his will:  "I bequeath the whole of my property to the United States of America to found at Washington an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men."  He, too, could have no idea of the ways to be taken to spread the gospel of knowledge.  His fortune has rendered it possible to found an institution in Washington, and from there has gone out to every museum in the world and exposition of note part of the accumulated treasures and distinctive features for the benefit of mankind.  Our United States government has been liberal in the matter of appropriations for the expositions held in other countries as well as our own.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Covers a Broad Field.</head>
                            <p>The Smithsonian institution and National museum covers so broad a field, as the chief exponent of scientific thought in America, that a few words as to its inception and operation should be given to the readers of The Bee.  The Smithsonian institution is to many but a name, few know of its wide-reaching work.  There is no reason known why Smithson, a foreigner, should bequeath his immense fortune to the United States for scientific research.  His will was bitterly fought by relatives, but in 1828 the United States won the suit, and with wise investments, augmented by bequests from other philanthropic men, the institution now has a permanent fund of nearly $1,000,000 in the United States treasury, drawing interest at 6 per cent per annum.</p>
                            <p>The successful organization of the institution has been the result of long continued effort on the part of men of unusual ability and wisdom.  Prof. Joseph Henry, who gave the world the electro-magnetic telegraph; Prof. Spencer F. Baird, than whom there is no higher authority on the mammals, birds and fishes of America and founder of the United States commission of fish and fisheries; and Prof. Samuel Pierpont Langley, pre-eminent physicist and astronomer&#8212;these are names high in the annals of America's learned men and each has given the best years of his life to the upbuilding of these institutions.</p>
                            <p>The objects of the Smithsonian institute are, first, to increase knowledge by investigation and study; second, to diffuse knowledge, not through the United States alone, but everywhere, by promoting an interchange of thought among those prominent in learning in all countries.  It constantly aids in the improvement of the people, both at Washington and at expositions where a part of its great and valuable collections are shown.</p>
                            <p>The three ideas, record, research and education, are the fundamental principles of the National museum, of which the Smithsonian institute is the custodian.  This is the only lawful place to deposit "all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of national history, plants and geological and mineralogical specimens, belonging to the United States.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">It is Easily Understood.</head>
                            <p>The official catalogue of the exposition gives so full a list and description of every object in the exhibit of these two institutions that it would be but repetition to speak of them in detail.  It should be remarked, however, that the series of objects of each department are cased, fitted and labeled exactly as in Washington.  The highest skill is used in the installation and the compactness and simplicity of labeling are so pronounced that it is unnecessary for an attendant to explain the exhibit.  A person can readily grasp the thought presented him and follow it to its legitimate conclusion.  For instance, in the department of anthropology there is given a clear and systematic presentation of the native American peoples and their evolution.</p>
                            <lg>
                                <l>At what age man came I know not,</l>
                                <l>Fossils prove not, tablets show not;</l>
                                <l>But his dim, remote existence</l>
                                <l>Is a fact beyond dispute,</l>
                            </lg>
                            <p>And here can be seen the first evidences of his work from prehistoric times,</p>
                            <ab>When the human first began.</ab>
                            <p>"Looking backward" through the ages one can see the growth of centuries and marvel at the advance from fire sticks to electricity; from stone ax to the brightest steel blade; from floating log to first-class steamer; and so on, ad liberatum.  The world has been culled for this series on anthropology and we who are privileged to see this exhibit may well exclaim:  "It is good to be here!"</p>
                            <p>The departments of biology and geology, with their divisions, are worthy of weeks of study, presenting as they do a series of objects, in themselves interesting.  They give an opportunity for the student to study intelligently and at first hand the best specimens obtainable of mollusks, insects, fishes, reptiles, birds (these should specially be noted for their varied and natural poses), mammals and seaweeds; and in the geological department everything from petrified extinct animals to precious stones.</p>
                            <p>The great benefit to be derived from such a complete display of scientific research cannot be overestimated, and careful study only enhances the interest felt by the thousands who pass around the well filled cases.</p>
                            <p>Dr. F. W. True is the representative of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum and made the selections for the Transmississippi Exposition.  He has also many able assistants who have had vast experience in exposition matters and know how to make an exhibit not only instructive but attractive.</p>
                            <p>W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the National museum, who is here in charge of this exhibit, and also secretary of the government board of management, has probably had more experience in connection with expositions than any man in America, having been attached in one capacity or another to no less than eleven.</p>

                            <head type="main">WORK OF MISSOURI WOMEN</head>
                            <head type="sub">Their Skill in Art and Literature is Fully and Creditably Shown in an Inviting Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>The department of women's work for Missouri furnishes an attractive exhibit.  It is advantageously situated in the southwest gallery of the Liberal Arts building, in connection with the educational exhibit of the state.  The exhibit, while worthy of a visit to the exposition on its own account, is so skillfully arranged as to invite rather than demand inspection, and to interfere in no way with the idea of an elegant parlor, a place for rest, and the greetings of friends.</p>
                            <p>The range and diversity of the work exhibited prove how varied are the interests and occupations now open to women.  A notable example is the leather work contributed by Miss Mary Bulkley of St. Louis.  In the collection is a portfolio of white leather embossed in pale green and lined with green moire antique; the bookbinding, of which there are several specimens, furnishes examples of expert tooling and all are of the finest material; there are card cases, a picture frame and belts for women's wear, richly ornamented in delicate colors and of the most exquisite workmanship.</p>
                            <p>The pyrography of Mrs. Minette Slayback Carper of St. Louis is another unique collection of high artistic merit.  A large linen chest of bold design is the most showy article of this burnt wood, but the tabouret, the panels, portfolios and picture frames show equal skill.  Among the smaller articles is a pipe rack in green and brown, the decoration being a quaint conceit of dolphins and the legend, "A wife may be a scold.  Give me a pipe."</p>
                            <p>Also from St. Louis are two beautiful landscapes in pastel, contributed by Miss Schuyler; two exquisite designs in embroidery by Miss Jolivet; an exhibit of wood carving and clay modeling, a book of sewing models and a series of drawings executed by the pupils of Miss Ball's school, and from the Wednesday club several very fine reproductions of well known masterpieces and also a large framed photograph of the club parlors.</p>
                            <p>The art exhibit sent from Kansas City contains work from nearly every studio there, including those of Van Millett, Weber and Huppert, "A September Morning" by Millet and one of Weber's best compositions in black and white being conspicuous among them.  Two exquisite bits, a landscape and an interior, are by Mrs. Mary L. Bookwalter, and one, a cluster of primroses, by Miss Laing.  There is a successful open air figure piece in oil by Hoy Campbell, two landscapes by Mrs. DeLaunay, an ideal head and a landscape by Mrs. Frank Brumback, a still life by Lillie May Smith, a charcoal head and one in oil by Mrs. Keith, "Strawberries" by Mrs. Billings, "A Girl Reading" by Mrs. McNitt, and an interior and a still life by Miss Paddock.</p>
                            <p>The laces and drawn work contributed by Mrs. Brisbane of Kansas City are marvels of intricate needlework.  A cabinet of ceramics exhibits some of the finest work of Miss Laing, who has also in frames two beautiful Dresdens, a Princess Louise and Marie Antoinette.  Other fine <choice><sic>specmens</sic><corr>specimens</corr></choice> of decorated China are sent by Miss Reynolds, Mrs. Thaxter, Mrs. Knotts and the Misses Standeford and Hammer.</p>
                            <p>An inlaid table in which are more than 6,000 pieces of native woods was sent from Bancroft by the maker, G. S. Tuthill; the case of birds containing 300 species and valued at $1,000 merits more than passing attention.  The collection contains nearly every variety of bird ever seen in Jackson county, and both the collecting and taxidermy are the work of Truman Rowe, a student in the Manual Training High school of Kansas City.</p>

                            <p>The excellent portrait of Mrs. Coates was loaned by her daughter, Mrs. Reed, and that of Judge McCrary by his family.  The carved rosewood easel which supports the picture of Judge McCrary is the work of his daughter, Mrs. H. H. McCune, and the exquisite little volume of original poems contributed by Mrs. McCrary and illustrated by Mrs. McCune fittingly completes the work of this gifted family.</p>
                            <p>The Emmerson club of Joplin shows a fine Indian ink portrait of Emerson.  This club has sent a notable exhibit in art needlework executed chiefly by Mrs. W. H. Wells, some beautifully decorated china, a mineral house, a model of the High school of Joplin and two paintings, one a beautiful head in pastel and the other an oil portrait of J. B. Sargent, both contributed by Mrs. P. F. Finch.</p>

                            <head type="sub">New Industry Which the Mormons Are Making a Great Deal of Just at Present.</head>
                            <p>The habits and customs of the silk worm are fully exemplified in the Utah exhibit in the Agriculture building at the Exposition, where the work of the insect is seen both in the rough and in the finished product.  The silk worm is not a native of Utah, it having been brought there some years ago from Japan.  Since then the silkworm industry has been an important one until now, when it is regarded as being one of the great resources of the state.</p>
                            <p>The egg of the silk worm is not as large as the head of an ordinary pin, but after being hatched it brings out a worm that when it reaches maturity is about an inch long and half an inch thick.  The eggs are hatched in the early spring, and then the young worm begins business.  To hatch the egg of the silk work it is necessary that it should be kept in a warm place where the temperature is very even.  As soon as the worm is out of the egg it commences to eat and at once develops a ravenous appetite, its choicest food being the leaf of the mulberry tree.  These leaves not only furnish food, but they furnish the worm the material for making silk.</p>
                            <p>Immediately after the silk worm hatches it is covered with mulberry leaves.  For six weeks it continues to eat and at the end of this time it has grown to its full size and is almost transparent.  This <choice><sic>transparancy</sic><corr>transparency</corr></choice> indicates that it is ready to go into the silk weaving business.  It is then placed on a bush in the same even temperature and it begins to spin, the spinning being done with its mouth and a few little feelers that protrude.  For days and days it continues to spin, covering itself completely with the delicate little threads which are wound and rewound about its body.  About the time it completes its task, it spins a coarser quality of silk and then the silk worm owner knows that his slave has about completed its labors.  This little ball that the worm has wound about itself now contains from 1,000 to 1,500 yards of the finest silk thread, 1,000 strands of which will not make thread larger than that used for ordinary sewing.</p>
                            <p>If allowed to remain, it grows wings, cuts through its cocoon, ruining the silk for commercial purposes, and emerges a full grown miller ,ready to lay another store of eggs, which the following spring, if gathered and kept in a warm place will develop into silk worms.  To prevent the worm from cutting through the cocoons, those that are not required for breeding purposes are killed in their shells.  This is done by throwing them into boiling water and leaving them there until the cocoon is scalded thoroughly through.  The next step is to unwind the silk from the cocoon.  This is done largely by delicate little machines, arranged that the required number of threads may be thrown together and twisted into one.</p>
                            <p>When first taken from the cocoon the silk is a delicate yellow, but it fades and becomes a pure white.</p>
                            <p>As yet Utah has no mills for the manufacture of silk.  The raw material, after being washed and wound into skeins, is shipped abroad to be made into the finished product.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Table Made of Precious Metals and Jewel Stones Shown in the Mining Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>Another exhibit from New Mexico has been placed in the Mines building and it is attracting more than the ordinary amount of attention.  It is only a table, but it is valued at $5,000 and is kept in a glass case and constantly watched over by a trusted guard.  The table is constructed entirely of gold, silver and precious stones and is the pride and joy of Commissioner Gleason.</p>
                            <p>Everybody who visits the exposition knows that New Mexico is a great mining territory, but the wealth of its mines was never fully realized until its ores were placed on exhibition.  Now, to clap the climax, the table has made its appearance.  This table stands four feet high, its top being about eighteen inches across.  The legs are of pure gold, worked in <choice><sic>filagree</sic><corr>filigree</corr></choice>.  Midway between the point where they rest on the floor and the top they are held together by a solid silver basket, which contains grapes, peaches, plums and cherries wrought in solid silver.  The top of the table is solid silver, around which is a band of pure gold.  In the center of this top, carved in gold, is the coat of arms of the state.  This is surrounded by rubies, some of which are as large as acorns.  On the four sides of the coat of arms of the territory are relief pictures carved in the solid silver.  One is a representation of the old palace, supposed to have been built 400 years ago.  Another is the San Miguel mission, a church that is 365 years old.  The third is a pueblo, or farm house, showing the plaza in front with a man on horseback, while the fourth is the present capitol building.  Around these are set pieces of gold quartz, while in the respective corners are placed pieces of agatized woods highly polished, the space between being inlaid with silver, in which are set numerous turquoises.  The panels on the four sides, just below the top, are of solid silver and carry engraved scenes, representative of the country.  One is a reproduction of a plaza at Santa Fe, showing the monument erected to the memory of Kit Carson, another a reproduction of Fort Collins and the parade ground, a third a farming scene, while a fourth shows an old water mill used by the Spaniards and later by the Indians.  In addition to this there are relief pictures of a mining scene of centuries ago, when the Indians climbed to the bottom of the shaft on ladders that were nothing more than tree trunks, into which were cut notches.  This has a companion piece showing the modern mine with all of its appliances.</p>
                            <p>The valuable table belongs to the Ladies' Board of Trade of Santa Fe and was eighteen months in course of construction.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>There's a brand new Indian in town.  He arrived at 3 o'clock yesterday morning and is as husky a little specimen as ever drew a matutinal meal from a mother's breast.</p>
                            <p>The new comer is the offspring of Spotted Back and his squaw, both members of the Omaha tribe, and both of whom appeared in the parade last Thursday, marching the entire route around the grounds.  The little Injun took very kindly to his first day on earth, and so far as the favored guests who were permitted to call upon him were able to observe, behaved quite as well and displayed as many symptoms of future usefulness as does the average white baby at the same age.  He seems to possess the lung power of a calliope, kicks like an ostrich, has as healthy a complexion as Ki-Yi, the Hottentot, and the foundation for an appetite that nothing short of a steam shovel will satisfy when he grows up.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Spotted Back is getting along equally well with the little one, as she got up and prepared breakfast for the family yesterday morning at the usual hour, and made herself generally useful around the Spotted Back wickiup.  An interesting coincidence in connection with this occurrence is the fact that Mrs. Spotted Back, whose maiden name was an unpoetic succession of sound that means Turns-in-the-Wind, was born thirty-two years ago just over the brow of the bluff within a stone's throw of the sod house in the rear of the Nebraska building on the bluff tract.  Her parents were passing through here on one of the periodic trips made by the tribe, and Turns-in-the-Wind first saw the light of day within the present city limits of Omaha at White Sulphur spring, although the spot was then two miles away from the frontier hamlet.</p>

                            <p>The christening of the new Indian baby will not occur for several days, as some time must be allowed to elapse to enable him to develop his natural propensities, and determine whether he belongs to the kick-a-hole-in-the-sky or the dig-a-hole-in-the-ground variety.  The baby christening will be quite an event in the camp, and will be made the occasion of a feast and a number of ceremonies that the Indians regard as necessary to fit the new arrival for a successful struggle with the dog meat and other foibles of this life.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime the lucky family will reap a financial harvest, as the war revenue charge of 25 cents on Indian babies has already gone into effect, and in every case the foreigner pays the tax.  In addition to the charge a number of visitors have contributed presents, all of the other residents of the camp having thus testified to their good will, until the dingy little wickiup begins to look like an Indian department store.</p>

                            <p>Captain Mercer has upset the plans of the exposition management with reference to charging an admission to the Indian Village.  He threw open the big gate yesterday and ordered that all visitors be allowed to visit all parts of the camp and see all that was going on without any extra charge.  He stated that the exhibit was made by the government and was not to be run as an exposition side show any more than the government building on the Grand Court or the Marine band on the Grand Plaza.</p>
                            <p>The policy of charging to see the Indian games occasioned a vehement kick on the part of the public from the start, and a number of visitors announced their intention of writing the authorities in Washington to see if the people of the entire country were to be taxed in order to provide means for retaxation after getting <choice><sic>insid</sic><corr>inside</corr></choice> the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>Captain Mercer stated yesterday that if is should be possible later on to get the Moqui snake dance, or such a feature as that, a special performance might be made of it, but that there would be no more of the general charge of the performances that are now being given.  He said that in the first place the present games, while interesting, were not of the kind that justified a special admission rate, and that in the second place he did not like the plan and would not have it.</p>

                            <p>The National Editorial association will be at the exposition September 2, 3 and 4.  It is expected that about 500 members will be present, and they will come in eighteen special sleeping cars, which will be sidetracked near the north entrance to the grounds, and will be the home of the visitors during their stay.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee yesterday extended the contract with Phinney's band until the end of the week, as the Mexican band will not be here Wednesday as expected.</p>
                            <p>While the showcase containing the first Spanish flag captured in Cuba was being taken to the Government building yesterday to be placed in the war department's exhibit, the glass was broken and the trophy was taken back to President Wattles' private office.  The flag will be installed in position today, however, and opened for the inspection of the public.</p>
                            <p>The visiting Knights of Pythias will make their headquarters at the Iowa building today, where special arrangements have been made for their entertainment.</p>
                            <p>The delegation of Blackfeet Indians arrived yesterday and they were duly installed in their new quarters in the Indian camp.</p>
                            <p>The sham battle between the Red Men and Indians will take place tomorrow evening at 6 o'clock.  A grand display of fireworks will follow at 9 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>Miss Alice French (Octave Thanet) was on the grounds yesterday.  She leaves for her home today, but expects to return later in the season.</p>

                            <p>The life saving crew will give its first exhibition on the lagoon Thursday at the close of the parade.</p>
                            <p>Special Press Commissioner R. W. Rishardson left last evening on a flying trip to Chicago.</p>
                            <p>Last evening's concert was the last production "From the Battlefield to Fireside" program, which has been increasing in popularity from week to week.  A large evening crowd turned out to enjoy it.  A trifling hitch in the fireworks was due to the fact that Montgomery &amp; Ward's horseless carriage had run over the wires and interfered with the working of the electric circuit.  Aside from that the card worked smoothly and was enthusiastically applauded.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Special Rates and Great Preparation for Red Men's Day.</head>
                            <p>One of the features of the day at the exposition Wednesday will be the thrilling sham battle between the Red Men and the Indians, which will occur at 6 o'clock in the Grand Plaza.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Robert T. Daniel, great incohonee of the Improved Order of Red Men and ex-judge of the United States circuit court of Griffin, Ga., is in the city and has taken apartments at the Mercer.  Mr. Daniel will deliver the principal address on Red Men's day at the exposition.  He has been very favorably impressed with his reception and the entertainment afforded him by the members of his fraternity here, and anticipates a celebration of unusual interest on Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>"The lack of any liberal concession on the part of the railroads," Mr. Daniel says, "has prevented a large representation coming from Georgia.  The almost total lack of advertising has also kept many visitors away, there being nothing heard of the exposition there, with the exception of press letters written by Governor Northern, who is in charge of the Georgia exhibit."</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock states there seems to be some misunderstanding in some quarters about rates for Red Men's days at the exposition.  Tickets will be sold at 1 cent per mile from points within a radius of 150 miles of Omaha, in all directions, August 9 and 10&#8212;good to return to August 13 inclusive.  This takes in Des Moines and St. Joseph also.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The reason that the exposition management was so reluctant to open a gate near the Georgia building was that it believed in the doctrine of first impressions, which, as most people know, is that first impressions are the most abiding; and as the management thought that the impression of the exposition obtained in a view from the east end of the lagoon was the most favorable, it wanted visitors to enter here first so that this great beauty might strike them and remain with them during their stay.</p>
                            <p>But the exhibitors in the Horticulture building and those who have had charge of the grass plots and the flower beds on the bluff tract thought that they had a great show, and they wanted the visitors to see them first.  Besides, they felt that they were so situated that visitors got around to them after they were tired out, and so they pleaded for a long time for a gate near the Georgia building.  This they now have, and as large a proportion as expected of those who approach the grounds, enter there.</p>
                            <p>The whole bluff tract is a garden, and most of those who make their way through it on gracefully curved and winding avenues never saw anything so pretty.  The recent rains, alternating with warm sunshine, have brought the whole out in its fullest beauty, and it is not uncommon to hear a person say that this is the prettiest part of the grounds that he has seen.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>Perhaps the most interesting spot is the aquatic pond just north of the Horticulture building.  It is so because the plants are growing in the water and are rare in the west.  The pond is 100 feet in diameter and its surface is now resplendent with odd flat floating leaves and gorgeous blossoms of all colors.  In the center are the Victoria Regias.  One variety, the Regia Trickeri, is now blooming.  It has white flowers ten inches in diameter with a rose center.  Its near neighbors are just sending immense buds to the top of the water which will be out in a short time.  The leaves, some of which are perfectly round resemble very shallow pans, the edges being turned up for an inch and corrugated.  These plants are favorite resting and sunning places for the frogs which may be seen idly squatting on them almost all hours of the day.  The Regias come from along the Amazon river and are found in other parts of equinoctial America.  They have been cultivated in northern regions about twenty-five years.  But they must have warm water if they bloom and the temperature of the water in the pond is kept by means of steam <choice><sic>popes</sic><corr>pipes</corr></choice> at 85 degrees.</p>
                            <p>Around the border, but taking up all the space between the very margin and the center, are the nymphaea of these varieties:  O'Harana, chromatella, pulcherrima, deaniana, Layd purpurea, Layd lilacea, cynthina, laydekeri rosea, corulea, kewensis, Robinsoni and seedling.</p>
                            <p>They have white, cream, yellow, pink, purple and blue flowers, and the plants differ much in the length of their stems and branches, some of the flowers rising proudly two feet out of the water, and others, through fear or modesty, refusing to come higher than just above the surface.  The plants were all furnished by a Philadelphia company and the pond has been the special charge of Henry Erfling of this city.</p>
                            <p>Presently, Prof. Taylor says, a sagittarius is to be added to this collection.</p>

                            <p>All over this tract and in the nook and corners about the main court the flowers and shrubs are in their full vigor, and Mr. Unger on the east side and Mr. Hadkinson on the west will see to it that all are trimmed and in holiday attire for the annual meeting of the Society of American Florists one week from tomorrow.  It is believed that the floral and landscape display afforded on the exposition grounds will be something finer than even the members of the society have ever seen.</p>

                            <p>Indications are that Saturday will be one of the biggest special days at the exposition.  Saturday is St. Joseph day, and every one of the prominent hotels is booked for large delegations.  The Millard, Paxton, Dellone, Merchants, Murray, Barker and Mercer are booked for delegations from fifty to 100 each.  Pryor's military band, thirty-five strong, and fifty guests, are booked for the Barker.</p>
                            <p>Four wholesale houses of St. Joseph have each taken one or more coaches for their own use, in which their employes will come to Omaha.  These cars will be decorated with banners designating the firm occupying the car, and it is said not less than six leading firms will have special cars.  The city and county officials have a special car, the Commercial club will have a car, and several cars will be required to bring the people aside from special cars chartered.</p>
                            <p>One thousand people are guaranteed, and those working the matter up say that at least 2,000 people will come, with two bands, and various other features of an attractive character will come.</p>

                            <head type="sub">To Help the Poor.</head>
                            <p>OMAHA, Aug. 6.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  Will you kindly find a place for the expression of the following idea in connection with our great Transmississippi Exposition?  We are all anxious to have it a decided financial success; we are equally desirous, I trust, that every one of our Omaha people may see the beauties and attractions of this great educator; we hope that even the most destitute amongst us may have the enjoyment of an entire day upon the exposition grounds.  On behalf of this last named class I beg to make the following suggestions:</p>
                            <p>1. Let a popular subscription fund be at once started to pay the admission fee of every one in Omaha who cannot themselves pay.  I believe that $1,000 will be amply sufficient for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>2. Let employers allow their employes the full day off and pay them for it; the time can be made up by working an extra hour for the following eight or ten days.</p>
                            <p>3. Let the Associated Charities have the distribution of the necessary tickets; its knowledge of the needy in Omaha makes that society the best superintendent of this effort.</p>
                            <p>4. Let kind hearted men and women provide an abundant lunch on the grounds (as was done recently for our soldiers and why not for our toilers?) and on presentation of the refreshment ticket, previously given to our guests, each and all (families together) can obtain their lunch and eat it where and when they please.</p>
                            <p>I would not ask the exposition authorities to make any reduction in the admission fee, the generosity of citizens ought to meet it in full and thus help in securing for our exposition the pecuniary success for which the directors are so untiringly working.</p>
                            <p>Trinity cathedral is paying the exposition fee for all its poorer members.  Cannot the same privilege be granted to every destitute person in Omaha?  It will be a disgrace to the wealth of our city if it allows one poor man, woman or child not to see the exposition when 50 cents can grant them the boon.</p>
                            <p>Such a day as I propose would be one of the greatest glories of our Transmississippi Exposition triumphs.  With the earnest co-operation of the Omaha press&#8212;and which now most earnestly I solicit&#8212;the suggestion can become a joyous reality.</p>

                            <p>CAMP GEORGE H. THOMAS, Aug. 4.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  From present indications the war is over; possibilities are two months will be required before peace negotiations are settled, during which time troops will be held pending settlement.  This regiment is desirous of spending its time at Fort Omaha, or better still, at the exposition.  We do not want to miss the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

                            <p>OMAHA, Aug. 6.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  To whose financial and business tact shall we credit the see-saw practice on Sunday admission?  It is the general opinion among business and workingmen of Omaha today that directing of exposition affairs since July 1 by the Board of Directors or executive committee simply justify your contention for a director general.  It is an outrage upon the labouring men of this city and vicinity to compel them to pay 50 cents for a half day on the exposition grounds, when the Government building is closed, the most attractive exhibits in other buildings covered up and many privileges barred in the various amusement resorts.  In other words, with two-thirds of the attractions cut off people must put up 50 cents or stay off the grounds.  It is the opinion of the writer that the decision to charge full rates yesterday arose from the fact that there would be a great many people here from Kansas City and the all-wise committee could not resist the opportunity to hold them up for full rates.  Give us a director general, give the Board of Directors and executive committee a vacation until October 31 and put them on a par with other stockholders by cancelling their passes and other extra privileges, cull a few thousand out of the deadhead list and I will guaranty a surplus at the end of the show.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The question of a 25-cent admission every night in the week promises to be a leading feature of the deliberations of the board of directors at their next meeting.  It is likely to be complicated by a sentiment of more recent origin which favors the absolute closing of the exposition gates on Sunday.  There is nothing to indicate that the latter idea is favored by a majority of the directors.  But it is generally discussed and a number of the directors declare that they favor it.  They base their position on the assertion that the Sunday closing is an essential correlative of any action that involves a reduced evening admission.  The 25-cent night rate, in their opinion, would kill the Sunday local attendance, and the aggregate weekly receipts would be as much in six days as if the show remained open every day.  They argue that the best solution of the entire problem is to close the exhibit buildings at 6 o'clock, make the admission 25 cents after that hour and then close everything up tight on Sunday.</p>
                            <p>In this connection some of the directors have been impressed with the plea of the concessionists, who contend that it is inhuman to compel their employes to work seven days in the week.  They allege that their show people are compelled to work from early in the forenoon until after midnight seven days in the week, and that many of them are wearing out under the strain.  If the grounds are closed Sundays the people will get a chance to rest and would be able to give more satisfactory performances than they can when they are fagged out from overwork.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">On the Other Side.</head>
                            <p>Other directors present a strong argument in opposition to this policy.  They suggest that a large proportion of the municipal excursions come to the exposition Saturday.  This is because business men cannot afford to leave their business two days to attend the exposition.  They can come Saturday or Monday and spend two days on the grounds with the actual loss of one day, but if the grounds were closed Sundays they would stay at home and an important revenue would be sacrificed.  As far as the Midway people are concerned, they suggest that if they are so anxious to rest Sundays there is no law to compel them to remain open.  The concessionaires' club could take action by which every member would be bound to close his resort on Sundays, without closing up the entire exposition for their benefit.</p>
                            <p>These conflicting opinions will probably be ventilated with considerable vigor at the directors' meeting Friday, but in regard to the evening admissions the board is becoming practically of one mind.  A few members still cling to their contention that the 25 cent rate will be an injury to the exposition, but as their arguments have been effectually annihilated by previous experiments they are largely outnumbered.  The only real difference is on the question whether the reduced rate should be made to apply to three evenings in the week or remain in force every night.  The majority view is that it should every night and there is every indication that this action will be taken with a possible exception in favor of evenings when there is some exceptionally strong attraction.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Today at the Grounds.</head>
                            <p>There was the usual attendance of genuine sightseers this forenoon, but in the absence of any special attraction the general public waited until after dinner when the celebration of the Iowa Knights of Pythias promised something to interest them aside from the ordinary exposition features.  The Knights were scheduled to arrive on the grounds at 2 o'clock and as most of them will be in uniform the parade to the Iowa building promised a very pretty feature.  The exercises of the day will be very brief in order that the visitors may devote themselves to seeing as much of the show as possible during their short stay.</p>
                            <p>The jubilation of the Red Men tomorrow is one of the biggest events of the week in anticipation and the committees who have had the arrangements in charge are confident that those who expect a big demonstration will not be disappointed.  The parade will start from Fifteenth and Douglas streets at 9 o'clock and after a circle through the business district the procession will march to the grounds where the exercises will begin at 11 o'clock in the Auditorium.  The program includes music by Phinney's band, an invocation by Rev. Campbell Fair, dean of Trinity cathedral, addresses of welcome by Governor Holcomb and Mayor Moores, responses by Charles C. Conley of Philadelphia and J. A. Seltzman of St. Joseph and the address of the day by Great Incohonee Robert T. Daniel of Griffin, Ga.  A big sham battle, which is one of the characteristic features of the demonstrations of the Red men, will occur at 6:30 o'clock, and the evenings will be fully occupied by the regular band concert and the display of fireworks on the north tract.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Indians Give the Grass, Squaw and Friendly Dances with Vigor.</head>
                            <p>The Indian congress continues to be one of the strong drawing cards of the exposition and is constantly growing in popularity.  While few new Indians are arriving those on the grounds are becoming better acquainted and are getting down to business.  They have settled into the routine of camp life, the strangeness having worn off.  Their dances are becoming regular features and as a result they are better patronized.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday the gates to the dancing and sporting grounds were thrown open to the public and the admission charge was dispensed with.  This was brought about through the instrumentality of Captain Mercer, who decided that as the Indians are a government exhibit people should not be compelled to pay to see them.  However, upon special occasions when some big event is carded, a small fee will be charged at the gate.</p>
                            <p>During the forenoon the Indians had the regulation flag raising, after which they repaired to the dancing enclosure, where they gave several full dress rehearsals to more thoroughly familiarize themselves with the dances that they will put on during their stay here.  In the afternoon they opened the ball with a grass dance, in which most of the men from the various tribes participated.  The same music, or what is called music, was furnished.  The grass dance is a dance common to all of the northern Indians and is said to commemorate the return of Indians who have been out on a horse gathering excursion and have been successful.  As none of the Indians had been out yesterday and as they had captured no horses those who participated simply played a part.</p>
                            <p>The musicians squat in the center of a big field.  When they are ready to start the festivities they commence a dismal chant, which is followed by beating on their drums.  Almost immediately a dozen half-naked and highly decorated Indian jump into the ring and waving their hands over their heads take up the refrain of the chant and pretend to keep step to the music.  Yesterday this dance continued for an hour, during which time fully 100 Cheyennes, Sioux and Omahas took part.  They danced until they were completely exhausted and then their places were filled by others who had been sitting around the ring and watching the performance.  The dance was pronounced a great success.</p>
                            <p>Following the grass dance a squaw dance was put on, the Omahas taking the leading part.  To the uninitiated it closely resembled the grass dance, but the Indians said that it was different.  However, the only difference that the white man observed was due to the fact that some women hung around the outer edge of the circle and attempted to keep time to the sounds that emanated from the wheezy drums.  In this dance the male Indians were out in holiday attire.  They wore all of the colors of the rainbow, while their bare backs were decorated in the most striking manner with grease paints, daubed on to represent horses, hunting scenes and animals.  Some of them wore their feather headdress and carried their tomahawks, which they brandished in the most threatening style.</p>
                            <p>During the evening the fun waxed fast and furious.  Large quantities of wood were carried to the grounds and after the sun had gone down the torch was applied and the ever present drum was brought forth <unclear reason="torn"/> renewed energy.  This was the signal for the assembling of the clans and they drifted in from all directions, completely filling the large circle within the ropes.  The Indians squatted upon their haunches until the signal for action was given, after which they put on and engaged in the friendly dance, a dance that had for its object the binding of the ties of friendship between all of the tribes present.  For an hour it was kept up and ceased only when the light from the piles of burning wood became <choice><sic>din</sic><corr>dim</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>With the Indians the friendly dance is the most significant of all, as it means that after an Indian has entered the charmed circle and taken a part in the festivities he will never think of harming any of the Indians who have participated.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mr. and Mrs. Spotted Back the Proud Parents of a Newborn Son.</head>
                            <p>There is a baby in the Indian village on the exposition grounds and consequently there is much joy throughout the camp.  It is a boy and is the offspring of Mr. and Mrs. Spotted Back of the Omaha agency.  It arrived upon this mundane sphere at 3:30 o'clock yesterday morning and four hours later the mother was up preparing breakfast for the family.  Little Spotted Back, for that is what his name will be until he is properly christened, is the first Indian child born in this vicinity in some time and consequently he is attracting much attention, so much so that his proud parents are exhibiting him in their tepee at 25 cents per exhibit.  The father of the youngster is about 35 years of age, while the mother, whose maiden name was Miss Turns in the Wind is about three years his junior.</p>
                            <p>There is a remarkable coincidence connected with the birth of Little Spotted Back.  Thirty-two years ago his mother's people were passing through Omaha and camped for the night at Sulphur Springs, under the bluff, just back of the Nebraska State building.  Here during the evening the mother of Little Spotted Back was born.  The place is hardly a mile from where the little fellow now in the Omaha camp was born.</p>
                            <p>The christening of the child of Mr. and Mrs. Spotted Back will be an important event and will be attended by some interesting ceremonies and will occur within the next few days.  While Captain Mercer will not act as master of ceremonies, he will see that all of the details are attended to and that every feature on the program is carried out as billed.</p>
                            <p>When an Indian child is born, or at least soon thereafter, the father gives a feast and calls in his neighbors to assist in the jubilation.  In this case Spotted Back will follow the usual custom and as there are many strange Indians here they will be invited to participate.  There will be a big feast, at which all dishes known to the Indian culinary art will be cooked and served.  Captain Mercer will furnish the material for these dishes and will see that there is an abundance of each.  After the feast there will be some speeches of congratulation delivered by the orators of the different tribes, the affair to end with a big dance, in which all of the Indians will participate.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the Indians heard of the birth of the child they commenced to arrive singly, in pairs and parties, all wanting to look into the face of the little thing.  Their desires were gratified and before leaving they all threw down presents.  Some brought food, other clothing, blankets, pipes, bows and arrows, calico, red cloth and everything intended to make an Indian father and mother happy.  The little Indian boy was oblivious to what was going on around and about him and spent his time swaddled in a blanket, now and then giving vent to a cry that in many respects sounded similar to the songs that the big Indians sing when they are putting on their dances for the benefit of their white brothers and sisters who stand around the roped circle and watch the performances.</p>

                            <p>There is trouble in store for some Indian, especially if his identity is discovered.  This particular Indian has been bootlegging.  In other words, he has been smuggling liquor into the camp and has been selling it to the other Indians.  Captain Mercer made the discovery yesterday and immediately issued an order to the effect that if the culprit was caught he would be turned over to the United States authorities to be dealt with according to law.</p>
                            <p>Several Indians are suspected of having had a hand in the purchasing of the liquor and they are being watched.  If the suspicions are confirmed the Indians will be driven out of camp and returned to the agency from which they came.  Captain Mercer is determined to maintain order in <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The Missouri peaches and grapes are coming in at a lively rate and are making a good showing.  The smallest peach in the lot measured twelve inches in circumference, while the large ones were nearly double this size.</p>

                            <p>A St. Joseph traveling man who was on the grounds yesterday says that the merchants of his city are inspired with a vigorous determination to make a bigger show at the exposition Saturday than their <choice><sic>Kansis</sic><corr>Kansas</corr></choice> City rivals did the week before.  A number of the wholesale houses have chartered tally-ho coaches, which are being lavishly decorated for the occasion and they will bring their entire corps of employes to swell the crowd.  Pryor's band of thirty-five pieces has been engaged to accompany the party and they expect to bring from 2,000 to 3,000 people.</p>

                            <p>Commissioner Leeson of New Mexico is expecting twelve tons of additional mineral specimens, which will be divided between the New Mexico and Minnesota exhibits.  The Minnesota people have failed to make an exhibit in any degree commensurate with the prominent position to which they were assigned in the building and the partially filled booth has been an eyesore to the other exhibitors ever since the exposition opened.  Commissioner Leeson has generously agreed to divide with the northern state and the vacant space will soon be occupied.</p>

In this case the piece was put on without the assistance of the chorus, but it was accompanied by the usual pyrotechnic features and was received fully as well as on its previous presentations.  The first part by Phinney's band included the overture from "Bohemian Girl," Weber's "Invitation" waltz, a selection from Robin Hood, three stirring marches and a cornet solo of his own composition by Mr. Rodenkirchen.</p>

Their only requirements will be ice, water and some other necessities, and these will be furnished by the exposition management.</p>

                            <p>The Minnesota honey has arrived and has been installed in the Apiary building.  The location in the building is considered admirable.  The honey is in jars, bottles and in the comb, and is attracting considerable attention.  Most of it is this year's product.</p>
                            <p>The 1 cent a mile rate from points within 150 miles of Omaha will be in force for the Red Men's celebration Wednesday and Thursday.  The tickets will be on sale Tuesday and Wednesday and will be good for the return trip at any time during the remainder of the week.</p>
                            <p>C. D. Casper, secretary of the Nebraska Exposition commission, is in the city and will do the honors at the state building during the coming week.  The regular semi-monthly meeting of the Nebraska commission will be held this afternoon in the building on the Bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Northen of Georgia, who returned to his home at Atlanta some days ago, writes that he is working on some additional features for the Georgia exhibit and that he will be here within two weeks, bringing along a carload of agricultural products, which will be placed in the State building.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Field and Secretary Danforth of the Minnesota commission, are making great preparations for Lumbermen's day.  The exercises will be held in the Minnesota building on the Bluff tract.  They will consist of the regular meeting of the Hoo Hoos from all parts of the United States.  It is thought that from 1,000 to 3,000 lumber dealers will be in attendance.</p>
                            <p>After spending several days at the exposition, D. J. Hennesey of Butte, Mont., has returned to his home, where he will work enthusiasm in favor of the great transmississippi show.  Before leaving he said that he regards the exposition as one of the greatest object lessons ever presented to the people of this country.  He added that during the fall months thousands of Montana people will be here to participate in the festivities.</p>
                            <p>The official photographer is having some trouble in securing pictures of the Indians, especially those who come from the remote parts of the country.  Yesterday he tried to get a shot at a group of Assiniboines and got his camera focused on the Indian in the center of the group.  Some of the other Indians noticed that the instrument was pointed their way and letting out a yell all of the members of the party dropped into the high grass and hid their faces in their blankets.  The interpreter in charge of the Indians say that they believe that the evil spirit lurks in the camera.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">OMAHA'S VANTAGE.</hi></head>
                            <p>The consensus of opinion everywhere is that the final conclusion of a treaty of peace between the United States and Spain will be but the forerunner of a marked increase of foreign and domestic trade and expansion of national industry.  With a complete return to the natural channels of commerce and a new stimulus to home consumption which the end of the war is sure to bring, the country is bound to push forward with still greater strides to prosperity that accompanies peaceful pursuits.</p>
                            <p>On this turn the people of this city and section occupy a vantage ground which they should utilize to its fullest extent.  Carried along the rising wave ahead of all competitors by the impetus of the Transmississippi Exposition, Omaha enjoys a starting handicap which should keep it constantly in the lead.  Not alone in material improvements worked out in preparation for the exposition has Omaha the advantage, but it is sure to emerge from the exposition season the best and most widely advertised city of its size in the United States.  Its reputation for push, pluck and indomitable energy is established and people who want to make investments in a community known to be on the upgrade will not have to make very extensive inquiries.  While there may be a reaction in certain directions with the close of the exposition, it will be discounted in advance and more than counterbalanced by the new industrial concerns that have been located here during the past few months.</p>
                            <p>Another factor making for Omaha's continued progress not to be underestimated is the ever-increasing resources of the agricultural territory tributary to it.  Successive good crops are putting the people of this and neighboring states on the soundest financial footing and making this section one of the best markets to cater to found in any part of the country.  With such prosperous surroundings the prosperity of Omaha can be confidently counted on to more than keep pace with that of the most progressive community in the transmississippi region.</p>

The boat was easily capsized by four men and the crew that Captain Knowles has on the grounds will be able to handle it with ease.  The performance yesterday was not an exhibition and it was limited to a mere experiment on the ability of the craft to be readily capsized and righted.</p>

                            <p>The members of the Improved Order of Red Men <del>are</del><add><note>were etc.</note></add> the guests of the exposition today, and with their wives and children they constitute a very perceptible addition to the usual crowd.  Some of them were among the early morning sightseers, but the bulk of the delegations <choice><sic>remainel</sic><corr>remained</corr></choice> down town to participate in the parade and march out with the rest of the procession.  This brought them to the grounds just before noon, and they passed under the Arch of States and proceeded at once to the Auditorium, where the inspiration of the day found vent in an interesting program of music and speeches.  This concluded, the visitors distributed themselves over the grounds to spend the remainder of their stay in a thorough enjoyment of the show.</p>
                            <p>The visitors almost entirely filled the main floor of the Auditorium and their bright scarlet regalia harmonized prettily with the patriotic decorations of the building.  Chief of Records Knowlton presided and in exploiting the sentiment of the day he briefly stated that it had originally been proposed that the Red Men should have a handsome fraternal building on the grounds.  Since the plan had never been consummated the celebration of today was the most fitting substitute.</p>

                            <p>The invocation was delivered by Rev. Campbell Fair, dean of Trinity cathedral, and in the absence of Governor Holcomb President Wattles of the exposition association delivered a short address of welcome, in which he emphasized the superiority of the spectacle in which they were invited to find profit and amusement.  He suggested that it was particularly appropriate that the order should meet here when the representatives of the last survivors of the race on whose customs their ritual was founded were congregated.  In a few years the original red men would no more exist and their rites and customs would only exist as they were reproduced by such organizations as this.</p>
                            <p>Continuing President Wattles urged the value of fraternal association in these days when the rights of individuals were too often lost sight of in the mad rush for wealth.  They had a part to play in the future of this country, the importance of which could not be overestimated.  In conclusion he invited the delegates to make themselves at home and to study the lesson of western thrift and enterprise that the exposition afforded.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores gave the Red Men an equally cordial welcome on behalf of the city of Omaha.  He expressed his gratification that during all its history and under various names the Order of Red Men had been true to the cardinal principles of their organization as expressed in their motto, "Freedom, Friendship and Charity."  It had ever been the enemy of despotism and tyranny and many of the great results of history had been largely due to the sentiments inspired and developed in the ranks of such societies.</p>
                            <p>The speaker reviewed the history of the order which had originated on the day when a sturdy party of patriots disguised as Indians, resisted the stamp act by dumping the cargo of tea into Boston harbor.  He congratulated the order on its past and predicted for it a glorious future.  In conclusion he presented the visitors with the golden keys to the city with the information that there was no lock that they would not open.</p>
                            <p>The rendition of the descriptive "Indian War Dance" by Phinney's band was recognized as peculiarly appropriate and was rewarded with an enthusiastic encore.  It was answered by the trombone quartet "Star Spangled Banner," which elicited another demonstration of cheers and hand-clapping.</p>

                            <p>The response to the welcoming addresses was delivered by Great Junior Sagamore E. D. Wiley of Des Moines.  He said that President Wattles is altogether too modest in his references to the exposition.  They, as near neighbors, had formed some conception of the enterprise and pluck of the people of Omaha and Nebraska, but what they have seen on these grounds is infinitely more beautiful than anything their imaginations had pictured.  They did not know that the people of Omaha had <unclear reason="torn"/>

                            <p>The band made another hit with a medley of southern melodies and then the crowd extended a hearty welcome to Grand Incohonee Robert T. Daniels of Georgia, who delivered the principal address of the day.  Mr. Daniels spoke in the most glowing terms of the magnificence of the exposition, which has been a revelation to him with others.  It afforded the people an opportunity to appreciate the pluck and resources of the west and to meet its generous and hospitable people.</p>
                            <p>Continuing the speaker referred in eloquent sentences to the conditions that now prevail.  Only a quarter of a century after a deadly civil war the men of the north and south vied with each other to be first at the front.  The last vestige of sectionalism had been forever wiped out by the blood of Ensign Bagley and the boys in blue and the boys in gray are ready to march into the jaws of death under the leadership of Fitzhugh Lee.</p>

                            <p>In discussing the mission of the order of which he is the head Mr. Daniels emphasized the spirit of fraternity and good fellow ship that it inculcated.  The location of a tribe in a community seemed to influence a new spirit that made it a better place to live in.  While it was originally a purely patriotic organization the element of fraternity has become almost equally conspicuous in its work.  It expends nearly $500,000 a year in caring for the necessities of its unfortunate members.  It brushes away the widow's tear and hushes the orphan's cry.  But it appeals most potently for recognition because it is a purely an American institution, born on American soil, nursed in the cradle of liberty and inspired by the principles on which our government is based.</p>

                            <p>The hotel men of Omaha held quite a lengthy session last night at the Mercer hotel.  The most important business transacted was the arranging for a hotel men's day at the exposition.  A committee was appointed to get out advertising matter and copies will be sent to every hotel east of the Mississippi river, urging the proprietors to have their hotels represented by one or more people on that occasion.  It is the general opinion that the 29th of August would be the day on which the meeting would convene.  If satisfactory arrangements can be made with the railroad companies it is quite likely that there will be a large attendance.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of the meeting Proprietor F. J. Coats invited those present to accompany him to the private dining room, where a lunch was in waiting.</p>

                            <p>The jubilation of the Red Men today is one of the biggest events of the week in anticipation and the committees who have had the arrangements in charge are confident that those who expect a big demonstration will not be disappointed.  The parade will start from Fifteenth and Douglas streets at 9 o'clock and after a circle through the business district the procession will march to the grounds where the exercises will begin at 11 o'clock in the Auditorium.  The program includes music by Phinney's band, an invocation by Rev. Campbell Fair, dean of Trinity cathedral, addresses of welcome by Governor Holcomb and Mayor Moores, responses by Charles C. Conley of Philadelphia and J. A. Seltzman of St. Joseph and the address of the day by Great Incohonee Robert T. Daniel of Griffin, Ga.  A big sham battle, which is one of the characteristic features of the demonstrations of the Red men, will occur at 6:30 o'clock, and the evening will be fully occupied by the regular band concert and the display of fireworks on the north tract.</p>
                            <p>There were no dances or other public exercises yesterday afternoon or last night on that portion of the exposition grounds occupied by the Indians.  Instead of amusing the whites the 450 Indians were resting or preparing for the sham battle.  All day long the Indians remained in their tents, burnishing up their implements of warfare, putting the finishing touches upon their war toggery, or laying out the plans for action.</p>
                            <p>The battle will occur on the open ground just west of the Transportation building.  Captain Mercer will command the Indians.  He will not wear the blanket and the breech clout, but he will ride a horse and will direct the movements of his savage followers.  For the time being he will act the part of a renegade white who is not inclined to give any quarter.</p>
                            <p>It is not certain who will command the white force, though it is known that some old-timer accustomed to Indian warfare will be selected for the occasion.  He will be assisted by a number of brave men who have seen life on the plains and who have fought Indians in their younger days.</p>
                            <p>The plan of battle is this:  The Indian lodges that are now in the center of the encampment will be moved into the timber at the west end of the grounds.  The whites will ride into the enclosure from the east.  They will go upon the theory that they have lost some Indians and are looking for them. After entering the grounds the commanding officer will scan the surrounding country and he will discover the Indian lodges a quarter of a mile away.  Then he will hold a hurried consultation with his officers.  Scouts will be sent out and in a short time they will return to report a large party of warriors with horses and families encamped a short distance away.  Another conference will be held and it will be considered advisable to attack the Indians before nightfall.</p>
                            <p>The command of 500 men will be lined up and will be informed it is to be a battle to the death.  All of those who do not desire to participate will be allowed to return to their homes.  A cheer will ring out and all will declare they will fight until the last Indian is killed.  These little matters having been looked after, the men will look carefully after their arms and ammunition and the command to move forward will be given.</p>
                            <p>The cavalry will make a wild dash right into the Indian camp, following the admonition, "that whenever you see a head hit it."  The men will shoot right and left, but before fighting fifteen minutes they will see that they are outclassed.  The Indians, who will be eating their supper at the time, will suddenly rush out of their tepees, and seeing the approaching forces, will rush into the fight on foot and horseback.  Captain Mercer will be everywhere present, and will instruct his red people to take as many scalps and horses as possible.  At the end of the time allotted for the fight the Indians will defeat their enemies, and will drive them from the field, capturing many and killing still more.  The dead men will be scalped, while the captured ones will be conveyed to the wooded space at the west end of the grounds, tied to stakes and wood and brush piled high around them.</p>
                            <p>Here the climax of the fight will be reached.  The Indians who have followed the retreating Red Men will have reached the infantry at the east end of the grounds.  These men, not having known the result of the fight, will observe the approach of their comrades and seeing that they have been defeated, will march in double quick order to the scene of the battle, driving the Indians before them.  They will be aided by the cavalry that will have been brought back into life.</p>
                            <p>In passing over the field numerous Indians will be shot down and, hurrying on, will reach the scene of torture just as the flames are reaching the men tied to the stakes.  Having rescued them they will continue to follow the Indians, who will retreat in great disorder.  A large number will be captured and thrown into prison, where they will be kept until the close of the war.</p>
                            <p>One of the most important captures to be made will be that of Captain Mercer, who will be known by the Indians as Wyoki Nicyople Tigurebli Acolthj, or Great Man Who Fights Them All.</p>

                            <head type="sub">First of a Series Will Come Over the Elkhorn Road on Friday.</head>
                            <p>The first of the series of school children's excursions will visit the exposition Friday and elaborate preparations have been made by the Board of Woman Managers to entertain their youthful guests.  The party is expected to include about 1,000 children from Norfolk, Hooper and the intermediate towns.  The special train will leave Norfolk at 7 o'clock Friday morning and arrive at the grounds at 11.  There the children will be met by a local committee consisting of Mrs. E. B. Towle of South Omaha, Mrs. S. C. Keys of Council Bluffs, and Mrs. N. P. Fell, Mrs. Orietta Shields Chittenden and Miss Alice Hitte of this city, who will have charge of them during their stay.  They will first be conducted to the Boys' and Girls' building, where Mrs. Winona S. Sawyer, president of the Women's board, will deliver an address of welcome, to which a young woman from Norfolk will respond.  This will be followed by a short program contributed by the various visiting schools and then the children will be turned loose in charge of their chaperons until 8:30, when their train will leave on the return trip.</p>
                            <p>The women who have charge of the arrangements are somewhat surprised to discover that a good many parents are reluctant to allow their children to participate in the excursion for fear of accidents.  This is regarded as a purely imaginary anxiety, because as a matter of fact there are few places where children would be safer than on the exposition grounds.  There are no street cars or vehicles on the grounds to run over them, there is no building going on, and in fact no condition that offers the slightest possibility of accident.  As each ten children will be in charge of a custodian in addition to the guardianship of the local committee and the exposition guards, the women feel safe in guaranteeing the entire safety of every child that is permitted to come.</p>

                            <p>Word was received last night to the effect that the Mexican band will arrive at midnight Friday night.  It is probable that this band will give its first concert Saturday afternoon and that the time will be divided between this organization and the Phinney band.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission was to have held its regular semi-monthly meeting last night, but music interfered with the deliberations of the members.  After they had settled down to business the Indian Cornet band from Flandreau, S. D., arrived at the building and serenaded the members of the commission and the visitors.  After the band boys had played several selections Hon. W. A. Poynter appeared and thanked them, after which cakes, fruit and coffee was served.</p>

                            <p>The latest arrivals at the Indian congress come from the Jacko reservation in western Montana.  The people represented are Flatheads and number seventeen, including men, women and children.  They are fine looking Indians, but not as large as the Rosebud Sioux.  They have been located under the big trees, just south of the office buildings, and attract considerable attention.</p>

                            <p>There will be a brilliant display of fireworks on the North tract just east of the Transportation building tonight.  The display will be immediately after the battle between the Indians and the Red Men.  Manager Cummins has made great preparations for the occasion and will put on a number of new features in addition to the regular display.  Of the set pieces there will be a large number, several illustrative of Indian life and habits.  He will also burn some big Red Man, but just who he will not say as he wants this feature to be a surprise.</p>

                            <p>Today's big event will be the sham battle at 6 o'clock in the evening between the Red Men and the Indians.  Upward of 1,000 men will take part in the engagement, which will occur on the grounds of the Indian camp on the north tract.  The Red Men will appear at the east end of the tract, and their cavalry will make a charge on the Indian camp, but will be repulsed with a heavy loss in killed and prisoners.  The Indians will pursue the retreating forces, who will retire until reinforced by their infantry.  A second charge will scatter the Indians in disorder, and their village will be destroyed and the survivors will be driven into the woods.</p>
                            <p>The Indians will be commanded by Captain Mercer, in the guise of a renegade white man, who will be captured in the final charge.  The prisoners taken by the Indians in the first charge will be duly scalped, and a number will be bound to stakes for torture and burning.  Wood will be piled around them, and everything will be in readiness for the fatal match, but unless there is an unexpected hitch in the program the second charge will bring the rescuers to the spot in time to save them.</p>

                            <p>A large quantity of ammunition has been secured, and the indications all point to a hotter time than the troops had at Santiago.  It was Mercer's original plan to have the Indians commanded by the chief of one of the tribes, but Indian <choice><sic>jealosuy</sic><corr>jealousy</corr></choice> upset the plan.  The redskins shows that they know how to sulk, and it speedily became apparent that if an Assiniboine chief was selected the Sioux and Apaches would not play, while if a Sioux was given preference the Winnebagoes, Omahas and Blackfeet wouldn't budge a foot.  Under the circumstances the captain concluded that the best thing he could do would be to lead the war-bonneted forces himself, but he gave it out cold that, while he was willing to be made a prisoner, he drew the line on being scalped or burned at the stake.  With this advance notice to the contrary, visitors need not express disappointment because Captain Mercer is not served up raw for their delectation.  He will do the best he can for their entertainment, but he has conscientious scruples that must be respected.</p>
                            <p>Orders have been sent to the Winnebago reservation for 150 more ponies to be used by the Indians in their various performances.</p>
                            <p>The Seventh Mexican cavalry band will arrive here on Friday at midnight.</p>

                            <p>The St. Joseph Young Men's Christian association arrived yesterday, and the greater part of the 700 excursionists will remain the rest of the week, as their tickets are good until Saturday, on which day the big excursion will come from that city.  The Young Men's Christian association excursion was gotten under way some time before the other was started, and it is a much bigger success than was anticipated, as the original plan was to bring about 500.  The party is largely made up of church people, the matter having been worked up through the pastors of the various churches.  All of the visitors are immensely pleased with the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The operating expenses of the bureau of admissions have been materially reduced.  Assistant Overbeck stepped down and out some time ago, and Superintendent Boehme's resignation took effect yesterday.  Mr. McQuaid, who has been a clerk in the bureau, is now acting as chief of the division.  It is stated that the vacated positions will not be filled, as the work of the bureau has been so systematized that it can be operated with a small office force.</p>

                            <p>Investigation of the practical workings of the pass system show that there were no wholesale frauds, such as were charged, and that the only classes of passes that admitted of manipulation were those first issued to workmen and the press passes.  The workmen's passes were good at any hour of the day, and could be "worked" by being passed out through the fence to a friend.  These have now been changed so that they are good for entrance for only two hours each day, and carry but one admission a day, being punched for each day.</p>
                            <p>The error in the press passes was in the manner in which they were issued.  They were signed by Superintendent Boehme instead of by the person to whom issued, but now have been replaced by new cards signed by the proper party, so that the gateman can identify the holder by the signature.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PHINNEY'S BAND DRAWS.</head>
                            <p>The "From Battlefield to Fireside" number was repeated last evening by request, with its spectacular accompaniments.  The number has become exceedingly popular and <choice><sic>semes</sic><corr>seems</corr></choice> to grow steadily in public favor.</p>
                            <p>The approaching departure of Phinney's band appears to be responsible for increasing crowds in the Plaza during the evening concerts, as the many admirers that the organization has made during its stay here seem determined to hear it as often as possible during the few remaining days before the termination of the engagement.  When the Marine band left many seemed to think that the real concert days were over, but a popular vote of the regular visitors would not indicate that sentiment now.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey of the ways and means department has prepared a statement regarding passes for submission to the directors.  It is along the line of the showing made some days ago by the World-Herald, giving the official figures, the actual count of the various classes of passes on August 4, with the following conclusion, explaining away a number of semi-sensational allegations heretofore made in print by Mr. Rosewater:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">LINDSEY'S STATEMENT.</head>
                            <p>To show the number who use their passes more than once, the following report of August 4, Indian day, is appended:</p>
                            <p>A, 265; B, 157; C, 259; E, 728; F, 3,516; G, 41; H, 47; 159, I; 61, L; 43, no letter; I, 63; K, 63; white slips, representing two admissions, series E, 342; series F, 1,654; total, 5,339.</p>
                            <p>In series E and F, which are employe photographic passes, 1,996 passed through the gates twice.  The total number of free admissions for that day, one of the "big" days of the exposition, was 5,339.  Deducting from this number the L passes, which are issued to persons crossing Twentieth street to Manderson, and the number of employes who passed twice through the gates there remains 3,282, the actual number of persons holding passes who were on the grounds August 4.  A complete record is kept every day of all passes issued and used.  More passes are needed now in exhibits and concessions departments than at the opening of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>On June 1 there were 115 concessionaires on whose account passes were issued.  Now there are over 200 concessionaires.</p>
                            <p>On June 1 between 700 and 800 exhibits had been placed, on whose account passes were issued.  Now there are more than 1,300.  Until after the middle of June all workmen and employes of the grounds and buildings department passed through a special gate, in which there was no turnstile, and up to that time no coupons were deposited by those employes, which accounts for the comparatively light number of free admissions on the records during the early part of June, when construction was heavier than at any subsequent period.  On June 22, 1,747 coupons were turned in from the grounds and buildings department, the result of several days' accumulation of coupons, taken in at the above mentioned gate after the turnstile had been put in.  This accounts for the <unclear reason="torn"/> of free admissions recorded <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>On June 30 there were 371 turners, who were to give an exhibition, admitted free, swelling the free list very materially on that day.  Instead of 1,500 employes, as has been stated, there are now in effect 3,531 photographic passes, which are issued to concessionaires, exhibitors and employes, not including workmen.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Unique, Instructive and Exciting Feature of the Midway.</head>
                            <p>Every one who attended the World's fair will remember the ostrich farm on the Midway.  Thousands who visited the farm had never seen a live ostrich before, and the exhibit proved so popular that its owners have secured a large tract on the West Midway at the Omaha exposition and placed in it nearly three times as many birds as were shown at Chicago in 1893.</p>
                            <p>The farm which furnished birds for both expositions was started at South Pasadena, Cal., about eighteen years ago, with forty genuine South African ostriches.  These were very prolific and there are now about 600 of their descendants on the home farm and its branches, and many birds are sold yearly.</p>
                            <p>When about three years old an ostrich reaches maturity and chooses its mate for life.  Even if one of the pair dies the other never remates&#8212;there is no such thing as divorce or remarriage in ostrich life.</p>
                            <p>Having chosen partners the birds select a sandy place for a nest, loosen the earth with their breast bones and scoop out a shallow hole about four feet in diameter with their feet.  Here the hen lays an egg every other day for a month.  At this juncture the lord of the nest shows his gallantry by helping his better half to hatch the eggs.  The hen sits from 9 o'clock in the morning until 4 in the afternoon and the male bird from 4 in the afternoon till 9 in the morning, the changes being made with clock-like regularity.</p>
                            <p>The period of incubation is forty days, and when the chicks are hatched they all look alike, being brown, with black stripes on their necks.  They are fed on chopped alfalfa, clover, etc., and they eat all the time.  For the first six months they grow at the rate of a foot a month.  At 18 months their first feathers are molted, the males becoming black and the females gray.</p>
                            <p>Both males and females have twenty-four beautiful white plumes under each wing.  These plumes are cut off every nine months.  The body feathers are allowed to fall out and are picked up by the attendants, as every feather has its value.</p>
                            <p>Ostriches will eat almost anything&#8212;but their principal foods are grains, grasses and fruits.  They swallow oranges with ease and relish, and they are more than pleased when served a dainty dish of whole oyster shells, seasoned to taste with gravel.</p>
                            <p>These mighty winged bipeds can eat off a table eight feet high.  They average about 300 pounds, live to an average age of 70 years and are worth $500 a pair.</p>
                            <p>The ostrich farm on the West Midway at the Trans-Mississippi exposition has more than forty full grown birds, besides the little fellows.  Here you can watch the ostriches from the egg to maturity, see them eat, dance, race and fight, and a lecturer describes their habits and points out their peculiarities.</p>
                            <p>But the most exciting feature of the program comes last, when a jockey mounts a barebacked, full grown ostrich and goes dashing away among the flock at a speed which makes on hold his breath.  Those attending the exposition cannot afford to miss it.</p>

                            <p>It was Iowa Pythian day at the exposition yesterday, but there was no considerable fluttering of gold badges until some time after noon, for the members of the Iowa Pythian grand lodge and of the Rathbone sisterhood, in session at Council Bluffs, did not come over until then.</p>
                            <p>The most of them came on a special train of the Terminal Railway company at 2 o'clock, landing at the southeast corner of the grounds.  They were there met by General Manager Clarkson and escorted to the Iowa building, where the formal welcome was to be made.  In the procession were about 1,000 persons.  They were preceded by the Phinney band and be the Council Bluffs division of the Uniform Rank.</p>
                            <p>At the Iowa building the brief exercises were conducted by C. C. Dowell of Des Moines, grand chancellor of the Knights of Pythias of Iowa.  He introduced Will L. Scism of this city, supreme representative for Nebraska, who delivered the address of welcome.  The response was made by Past Chancellor Ben Selinger, reporter for the supreme court of Iowa.  Mr. Selinger added to his wide reputation as a wit and good talker, and both addresses commended the character of the knighthood in the two neighbor states.</p>
                            <p>This was all the ceremony there was.  Following the exercises the Phinney band gave a concert from the veranda of the Iowa building, and those of the visitors not attracted by the music spread to all parts of the grounds, where their bright badges made them conspicuous until the gates closed.</p>

                            <p>The sham battle came off after a fashion, but it was not due to any material assistance from the Red Men.  That organization "flunked" at the last moment, and had it not been for Captain Mercer's determination that the public should not be wholly disappointed there would have been no performance.  The Red Men's committee had been pushing the scheme enthusiastically for several days, but at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon they sent word that they would not take part.</p>
                            <p>The announcement occasioned a great deal of disappointment, and Captain Mercer promptly decided to go ahead and give some kind of a performance with the Indians alone.  He subsequently induced the Wild West management to join with him, and a very realistic exhibition was given with Indians and cowboys.  A number of Red Men who disapproved of the "flunk" of that organization were on hand and helped out very materially in the number engaged.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">REALISTIC FIGHT.</head>
                            <p>The engagement took place in the camp grounds and consisted of an attack on the Indian camp by the cowboys, led by Dick Mattox and Rattlesnake Pete.  The Indians retreated to the cover of the woods, where they rallied, and charging furiously routed the cowboys, killing the capturing several.  The prisoners were dragged back to the camp, where they were bound to trees.  Around them danced their captors, who waved a number of bloody scalps that had been deftly cut from the heads of the victims who fell on the field.  Before the torture was begun, the cowboys charged again and rescued their prisoners, and the engagement closed with a general <choice><sic>fusilade</sic><corr>fusillade</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>The prisoners who narrowly escaped a horrible death were T. G. Magarrell of Omaha, L. A. Nelson of Valparaiso, Neb., and J. C. Thomas of St. Joseph.  Nelson escaped form his captors by cutting the rope with which he was bound, but was recaptured and triced up like a turkey.</p>
                            <p>The most noticeable feature of the entire <choice><sic>pereformance</sic><corr>performance</corr></choice> was the manifest enjoyment of the Indians and the keen interest with which they entered into it.  One old Indian, especially, was a picture, as his face lighted up with intense satisfaction when the prisoners were bound to the burning posts.  It was generally remarked that he had undoubtedly taken part in such occurrences when they meant something, and that the recollection was obviously pleasing.</p>

                            <p>Some trouble was experienced in getting the arms for the Indians, but a supply of rifles, revolvers and ammunition was finally obtained.  It is the intention to repeat these performances later on, and all of the semi-savages will be fully equipped.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of the fight all of the warriors, as well as the crowd, gathered around Captain Mercer, and cheers were given with a vim for Mercer, the Indians and the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Difficulty was experienced in keeping back the crowd from the field during the engagement, but the guards did very well in that direction.  Captain Haze made a stupid blunder by rushing out and arresting two of the Red Men who were participating in the engagement.  The men were A. P. Phillips and G. R. Helsley of St. Joseph.  They had stepped out of the line to get additional ammunition, and on returning were placed under arrest by Haze and sent to the station under orders to be locked up.  They were subsequently released.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ALL THE WAY FROM DAWSON.</head>
                            <p>Frank D. Quigley and J. C. McDannel, representing the Yukon Midnight Sun, reached the grounds yesterday.  They left Dawson City July 2 and are traveling on a $5,000 wager to visit London and return to Dawson before navigation opens next year.  They are selling souvenir copies of the Sun at 25 cents each.  They left Dawson without a cent and arrived here about $100 ahead of the game.  While crossing the trail they were not allowed to sell a paper for less than $1, cutting the price to 50 cents at Juneau and to a quarter at Seattle.</p>
                            <p>They tell some interesting incidents of life in the Yukon.  When the first paper containing the news of the battle of Manila reached there the fortunate possessor hired a hall and sold tickets, and read the paper aloud from an improvised platform.  He cleared up $600 on his gate receipts and then sold the paper for an additional $100.  A man from Council Bluffs reached there two months ago with ten copies of the World-Herald.  McDannel offered him $15 for the bunch, but the thrifty Bluffs man declined and went out and sold them for $2.50 apiece.</p>

                            <p>About the usual number of exposition visitors took advantage of the delightful morning to spend the forenoon on the grounds and toward noon they were joined by large accessions of people who were chiefly interested in the special features of the afternoon.  The paid admissions during the last two or three days has been maintained well towards the 10,000 mark, and while there are no excursions from out of town points scheduled today, there is apparently no falling off in the attendance.  The life saving exhibition, which will occur at 2 o'clock, seems to interest the people more generally than any previous feature of the month, and the station, west of the Fine Arts building, was visited this morning by hundreds of people curious to ascertain what the entertainment would resemble.</p>
                            <p>General Manager Clarkson has announced a number of additional special days, of which Ohio day is one of the most important.  This will be celebrated October 5, and, as the same day has been set for Pennsylvania day, and the following day is New York day, there will be a large gathering of representative easterners on the grounds at that time.  The three occasions were bunched on the recommendation of Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation, who suggested that by this means decidedly more favorable railroad rates could be secured than would be granted for three separate occasions.</p>
                            <p>September 23 has been designated as Quincy day, and the business men of that enterprising city <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> begin at once to make plans for a large representation.  No arrangements have been formulated for the celebration on the grounds, but it will probably be very similar to that of Kansas City day.</p>
                            <p>At the request of the local committee Modern Woodmen day has been changed from September 18 and 19 to September 22.  It was thought that the latter date would be more satisfactory, as the first designated conflicts with another event in which most of the members of the order are interested.</p>
                            <p>Next Sunday religious services will be resumed in the Auditorium, and it is the plan of the management to continue them during the remainder of the exposition.  Rev. Celia Parker Woolley of Chicago, who took a prominent part in the deliberations of the Women's Congress, will preach at 4 o'clock Sunday on the subject, "Things Commonly Believed Among Us."  Music will be furnished under the direction of Superintendent Kelly.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Day at the Exposition Proves a Great Attraction for the Riders.</head>
                            <p>Next Monday will be Wheelmen's day at the exposition and present indications point toward a grand success.  Riders from all the neighboring states have signified their intention of being present on the day set apart for them and Chief Consul O'Brien says he expects 500 at the lowest with a very likely 700 to take part and ride in the special parade at the grounds.  Elaborate preparations have been going on for weeks and the scorchers around Omaha have been <unclear reason="torn"/> their brains for new ideas of floats and wheel decorations.  The fair association has agreed to pass every rider free who can present a well-decorated bicycle.  There will be different ideas as to decorations, however, and a waving ribbon or a neatly tied flag about a wheel will be no means guarantee a free admittance.  Consul O'Brien has appointed a special committee to see to these decorations at the gate of the grounds and this number will decide whether a rider is entitled to a pass.  As the matter now stands, it looks as if the riders whose decorations are not sufficient for free admission will be charged the regular price of 50 cents.  Strenuous efforts are being made by the wheelmen of Omaha to get the price reduced Monday evening to 25 cents, and it is possible that this may become the special rate for the occasion.</p>
                            <p>Several beautifully decorated floats will be in the parade and the procession of some 600 or 700 riders will be well worth seeing.  The parade will start about 7 o'clock at the Grand plaza, where the line of march will extend south around the Horticulture building, north to the West Midway, then south on Twentieth street, passing under the Administration arch around the main lagoon and north again on Twentieth street to the Midway and ending by turning east to the Grand Plaza, where the parade will stop.  A mass meeting of the wheelmen was held in Turner hall last night, where the completion of the plans for the day was the chief object of the gathering.  About fifty representatives were present from Council Bluffs and many from Omaha and made a right jolly assembly.  Refreshments were served and every one seemed highly elated over the prospects for a successful day.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The meeting of the Western Passenger association in Chicago on Wednesday to consider the recommendations of Omaha terminal lines for reduced rates to this city during the remainder of the exposition was the liveliest that association has held within a year.  The recommendations for reasonable rates to Omaha were not concurred in by all the lines, but the rates are going into effect just the same on Saturday, August 20.</p>
                            <p>The meeting broke up without any definite action being taken on the proposition.  Another meeting will be called in Chicago for the early part of next week.  At that time an effort will be made to have all the lines belonging to the association concur in the reduction.  If the effort does not succeed it is practically agreed by all of the Omaha terminal lines that they will put in the rates recommended on August 20 and keep them in during the life of the exposition, the opposition of other lines to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
                            <p>The railway companies represented in the association and without lines to Omaha are the principal kickers against the granting of reasonable exposition rates to this city.  In fact the Chicago &amp; Alton went so far as to write out a letter of withdrawal from the Western Passenger association, to take effect if the proposed exposition rates are made effective.  No great attention was paid to this letter and by most of the general passenger agents it is looked upon as a bluff, few even reading the letter.</p>

                            <p>The meeting adjourned when things were rather warm and it is thought by next week matters would have cooled off a bit.  It is not believed here that the Alton will break up the association in view of the generous treatment the association has always accorded that road.  On the other hand most Omahans would relish nothing more than the withdrawal of the Alton and the entire collapse of the Western Passenger association.  Such an event would mean the cheapest lot of rates Omaha has enjoyed for a long time.  As one passenger man said to The Bee:  "When the lines get to scrapping look out for some mighty low rates."</p>
                            <p>General Passenger Agent John Francis of the B. &amp; M. was the only Omaha passenger man present at the Chicago meeting.  General Passenger Agent Buchanan of the Elkhorn was prevented from attending by illness, and General Passenger Agent Lomax of the Union Pacific was unavoidably detained here.  In speaking of the meeting, Mr. Francis said:  "Nothing was finally accomplished.  The recommendations for lower rates to the exposition agreed upon by the Omaha terminal lines were strongly opposed by other lines.  The principal opposition was met with when reduced rates from far eastern and far western points were recommended.  In the controversy one of the lines threatened to leave the association if the rates were put into effect.  With things in this shape it was thought best to adjourn for a few days and let the other lines think the matter over.  The date on which the Omaha terminal lines recommend the lower rates to go into effect is August 20.  Another meeting will be held in Chicago the first of next week, and I anticipate that final action will have to be taken at that time."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Port Arthur Line Announces a Very Low Rate for Ten Days.</head>
                            <p>The Port Arthur Route has determined to do all in its power to make Texas day at the Transmississippi Exposition a success.  The Texans will celebrate here on Thursday, August 18, and the indications are that there will be a large attendance from the Lone Star state.  Harry C. Orr, general passenger agent of the Port Arthur Route, has advised The Bee that a rate of 1 cent per mile from the Gulf of Mexico to Omaha and return will be put into effect for this occasion.  The tickets will be good for return any time within ten days after issuance.</p>
                            <p>This is the most liberal and most extensive rate that has yet been granted to Omaha on account of any special day at the exposition.  It places a rate of 1 cent per mile to Omaha within the reach of people living within 1,000 miles of Omaha to the south, or, in other words, make a rate of 1 cent per mile to the exposition from tide water and from the territory between here and the Gulf of Mexico.  The extent of the Texas day rate is best appreciated when contrasted with the rates offered for previous special days, good within a radius of 150 miles.</p>
                            <p>Governor Culberson and his staff will be on hand to officially represent Texas on this occasion and they will be accompanied by a large party of state officials.  The exposition is well known throughout the state of Texas, several parties of Omahans having visited there last year and during the winter and made the Texans acquainted with the scope of the exposition and its attractions.</p>

                            <p>Had it not been for the persistent efforts of Captain Mercer, the sham battle between the allied tribes of Indians and the <choice><sic>wihte</sic><corr>white</corr></choice> men, fought yesterday evening upon the exposition grounds, would have been a complete failure.  As it was, it was a brilliant success, witnessed by thousands of spectators.</p>
                            <p>A couple of weeks ago a delegation of the Improved Order of Red Men called upon Captain Mercer and asked him to allow the Indians to participate in a sham battle which they proposed to have during the meeting of their grand lodge, which is now in session in this city.  The captain told the members of the delegation that he would take the matter under advisement and let them know at a certain time.  At the end of that time he informed them that he was willing to go into the scheme, providing they were on hand to do their part.  They assured him that they would have several hundred men in line and that they would be prepared to put up a most realistic fight.  Later on the captain was assured that all of the plans had been perfected and he knew nothing to the contrary until 3 o'clock yesterday, when he was informed that the Red Men, or at least a greater portion of them, would not appear.  This was owing to the failure of the Tennesseans to appear.  Having given out the information that he would assist in amusing the public, Captain Mercer at once set about laying his own plans and perfecting ways and means for the battle that was to occur three hours later.  He sent down town and borrowed a lot of the guns used by the High school cadets, he sent out and bought blank cartridges and 
                            
                            <pb n="41" xml:id="TMISB06-041"/>
                            
                            hired horses, enough to equip all of the Indians and riders in the Wild West show, as well as a greater portion of his own warriors.  He next visited the Wild West show and induced Manager Mattox to take a part himself and allow his Indians and rough riders to participate.  Thus, with the aid of a few of the Red Men, who went into the fight, he had some 600 or 700 men lined up for the fray.</p>
                            <p>The fights was white men, cowboys and friendly Indians against the Indians of the congress, who were supposed to be hostile.  The attacking party was commanded by Manager Mattox, with Rattlesnake Pete as chief of scouts in command of the friendly Indians and the Red Men.</p>
                            <p>Just as the sun was sinking behind the fence that surrounds the exposition grounds on the west side, the allied Indian forces and their commander, Captain Mercer, who for the occasion posed as a renegade white, finished their supper and unsuspicious of danger, repaired to the tepees for the night.</p>

                            <p>Around the camp fires and while the smoke from the smouldering embers was ascending toward the sky, Red Dog, a Brule Sioux, rushed into the tent of the leader and informed him that a party of horsemen and men on foot were sweeping down upon the village from the east.  Hastily throwing off their blankets, Captain Mercer and his two aides, Wise and Hegge, also renegade whites, stepped outside and scanned the eastern horizon with their glasses.  Over the gentle rise of ground just west of the Dairy building they discerned a cloud of dust and a moment later horsemen were visible.  The three white men grabbed their weapons and uttered a shrill war whoop, aroused the camp.  Captain Mercer mounted his horse which was tethered near by and throwing himself into the saddle, scurried through the village, informing his braves that the the whites were upon them and to prepare for battle.  Wise and Hegge rushed into the camps of the Assiniboines and the Flatheads and urged them to prepare for a fight that promised to be to the death.  Almost instantly the Indians were out and placing their wives and children beyond the ropes that <choice><sic>surounded</sic><corr>surrounded</corr></choice> the enclosure, painted and bedecked with feathers, returned and rallied around their leader.  By this time the command of Mattox was upon them, shooting down Indians right and left, their motto apparently being, "If you see a head, hit it."  For a time the Indians were unable to withstand the assault.  They retreated to the timber at the west end of the ground, leaving several of their number dead upon the field of battle.</p>
                            <p>Just at the edge of the timber the horsemen under Mattox halted.  This gave Captain Mercer an opportunity to rally his forces and gathering them about him he urged them to battle as did their forefathers a century ago.  The words were like magic and inspired the Indians with courage.  Uttering a war whoop that froze the blood of the spectators, they charged the whites and drove them across the field much the fashion of a herder who drives his sheep.  In the disorderly retreat, the whites lost a number of men.  These were promptly put to death and scalped or turned over to the squaws, who were following in the wake of the savages like so many vultures.  It is presumed that these squaws tortured their victims in the most heartless manner, as their cries for mercy were piteous and sounded above the din of the musketry.  On the Indians pressed the whites until they drove them well up to the gates of the Dairy building.  At this point the Indians discovered that they had carried the war a little too far into Egypt.  It was here that they met their Waterloo.  A squad of infantry had come up from the vicinity of the Transportation building and as the members of the command sniffed the battle they rushed into the breach and beat off the Indians, who retreated in good order, taking with them a number of prisoners.</p>

                            <p>The white men not being certain as to the number of Indians in the woods, held a council of war and after resting their horses and eating some hard tack, concluded to follow and wipe out the entire savage outfit.  The order to march was given and both cavalry and infantry proceeded toward the Indian village.  Nearing there, they heard sounds and saw sights that froze the marrow in their bones.  Around the encampment they saw a half score of their comrades lying around in the grass, their scalps torn off and their bodies horribly mutilated.  A little further on they saw three huge fires blazing around the roots of three cottonwood trees.  Lashed to one tree was L. A. Nelson, who had been captured, broke away and had been recaptured.  Tied to another tree and down upon his knees was T. G. Maggarell, one of the prominent Red Men of the city, while a little further on was Dan Huntzinger, who was praying and invoking the spirits to come to his assistance.  The Indians were dancing about them, whooping and yelling, singing their war songs, while the squaws were plucking brands from the fires and pushing <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Mattox and his men did not delay action any longer.  Riding into the center of the group of savages, they clubbed their guns and struck right and left until they reached their comrades.  Releasing them they turned their attention to the savages, who seeing that the jig was up, surrendered.  Their leader, Captain Mercer, made a plucky fight, but was finally overcome and bound hand and foot and carried to the improvised prison located near the spot where the Indians get their drinking water.  After being informed his followers had been practically wiped from the face of the earth, he agreed to quit his roving life and settle down and become Indian agent, if given a chance.  He was promised that after the exposition he could have the Omaha agency and that his Indians could return to the reservations from which they came.  The terms were explained to the Indians and were accepted as satisfactory.  After that hostilities were declared off and both Indians and whites joined in cheering for Captain Mercer, Commander Mattox and the exposition.</p>
                            <p>If a supply of ammunition can be secured, the battle will be repeated this afternoon.  If it should be fought, the plan of attack will be somewhat different, as it is not the intention that the Indians shall be taken by surprise.</p>

                            <p>The children have another inning at the exposition today, and fully 1,000 school children from the state, added to a large number from Omaha and its vicinity, are enjoying the big show.  This is the first of a series of school children's excursions from various sections of the state, and as it is an entire success others will be arranged at short intervals during the next few weeks.</p>
                            <p>This morning the crowd came from Norfolk, and the intermediate towns as far east as Hooper on the Elkhorn road, and it enjoyed the distinction of being the first excursion party that brought as many people as were forecasted by its progenitors.  The estimates received by the Board of Women Managers indicated that 1,000 people would participate, and almost exactly that number were unloaded at the gates when the long train pulled in this forenoon.  The train was due at 11:25, but it was noon when it arrived, and on that account some of the plans that had been made for the celebration of the day were dispensed with.  The party was met at the gates by General Manager Clarkson and W. N. Babcock of the exposition and by a committee from the Women's Board consisting of Mrs. W. S. Sawyer, Mrs. Frances Ford, Mrs. N. P. Feil and Mrs. Orietta Shields Chittenden.  They were conducted down Twentieth street and through the Manufactures and Electricity buildings to the Boys' and Girls' building, where a short program of exercises had been anticipated.  By this time it was after lunch time and the children were perceptibly restless and disinclined to sit and hear speeches when there was so much to attract their attention outside.  The committee very sensibly concluded to confine the exercises to brief statement to the visitors that they were welcome and an outline of the features of the day and when and where they would occur.  <choice><sic>The nthe</sic><corr>Then the</corr></choice> children were dismissed, the lunch baskets were unpacked and the provender disappeared with amazing rapidity.</p>
                            <p>At 3 o'clock the youthful visitors were entertained with a pretty display of Japanese fireworks on the Plaza that they thoroughly enjoyed.  The air was populated with floating clowns, pigs and other familiar objects and the children applauded vigorously.  They will spend the entire afternoon on the grounds and leave for home early in the evening.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ahead of All the Exhibitors in Variety of Fruit Shown.</head>
                            <p>So far as county exhibitors are concerned that of Douglas in the Horticulture building appears to be in the lead.  Some of the states have larger, but it is conceded that none have a greater variety of fruits to show.  In addition to the apples, the varieties of which are almost countless, there are cherries, blackberries and all of the small fruits that went out of market weeks ago.  Just now the county is making a great showing in plums and peaches.  There are a dozen varieties of plums and will be many more before the end of the month.  Some peaches raised along the crest of the river bluffs are pronounced as fine as those from some of the great peach raising states.</p>
                            <p>Robert J. Furnas of Brownsville is making a special effort to advertise Nebraska as a great fruit raising state.  He is exhibiting the celebrated Muhr plums, as big as those from California and even more delicate in coloring.  This year he will raise something like fifty bushels of this fruit.  He is also showing the "Stumps the World" peaches, some of which measure fourteen inches in circumference.  In addition to his peaches he has sent in a lot of tomatoes, three varieties of pears, two of grapes and the first figs ever seen at the exposition.  The figs that he is showing are about the size of Bartlett pears and are as finely colored as those from southern California.  This year Mr. Furnas has 30,000 bearing apple trees, 700 pear and nearly 1,000 peach trees.  His orchards contain nearly 400 acres.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Wilson is daily making additions to the southern California exhibit, and at this time he has about as much fresh fruit on exhibit as some of the nearby states.  During the last day or two he has received the orange cling peaches, as large as base balls and colored like oranges.  He has also received the Hungarian prunes, the first shown, and some Japanese and Washington plums that are as large as the ordinary Ben Davis apples.</p>

                            <p>After spending a month in his home state working up enthusiasm, Vice President Johnson of the Texas State Exposition commission has returned to the city.  He says that the plans for the observance of Texas day, August 18, have all been completed and that fully 1,000 of the residents of the Lone Star state will be in attendance upon that occasion.  All the railroads but one have made a rate of one fare for the round trip from all points in Texas, and the Port Arthur makes a rate of 1 cent per mile.  Governor Culbertson and his staff will come in a special car.  While here it is expected that the members of the party will make their headquarters at the Minnesota building.  The state day exercises will be held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock in the forenoon.  The program follows:</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The first children's excursion to the Transmississippi Exposition, conducted on an extensive scale, was brought in this morning by a double-headed train of thirteen cars over the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley railroad.  There were somewhat over 900 tickets taken up on the excursion train.  There were 750 children and 150 accompanying adults, and each chaperon had a merry time in handling the five children assigned.</p>
                            <p>The train pulled into the Elkhorn's exposition terminal station near the Twentieth street boulevard, north of Ames avenue, at <unclear reason="torn"/>
                            
                            <pb n="45" xml:id="TMISB06-045"/>
                            
                            partment of Transportation, Mrs. Frances E. Ford, Mrs. N. P. Feil, Mrs. E. B. Towle of South Omaha and Mrs. Sawyer were at the station to receive the youthful visitors, and assisted in getting the little folks started toward the exposition grounds in good shape.  The train was a long one, and before the two locomotives drawing it had come to a standstill several hundred heads were sticking out the windows of the thirteen cars, and there was one simultaneous yell of delight went up from the 750 small, but powerful throats.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the train had stopped Superintendent H. C. Mahanna of the Elkhorn road jumped off the train and told the children they could get off and form in the proper rank and file.  They tumbled off at the rate of about a half a dozen a second, and the alacrity with which they appeared on the ground made it plain that they had been ready to leave the train as soon as the exposition grounds hove in sight.  On the platform the children were marshaled by the school teachers, mothers, elder sisters and aunts, who acted as chaperons, into battalions, companies and squads.  Here was a Sunday school class from one town, and there was a lot of pupils from the school room that is closed on Sundays.  Yonder was a collection of little ones who lived near together, all under the patronage of one mamma.  The school children from Scribner were headed by a big boy, the biggest in the school, who carried the flags of the United States and Cuba and appeared satisfied with his job.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Made a Pretty Picture.</head>
                            <p>Within five minutes after the train had stopped the youngsters had formed into line and taken up the march down the Boulevard toward the exposition grounds.  They presented as pretty a picture as has been seen in the vicinity of the exposition this year, and a lot prettier than some of the imported pictures along the Midway.  The school girls seemed to outnumber the boys in about the same proportion as the women always exceed the men in number at the church prayer meetings.  The ages varied from 6 to 8 years up to the age where girls stop telling how old they are.  The oldest boys looked as though they had passed 18 and 19 pleasant seasons.  The bulk of the visitors were between 12 and 15 years old.  They were all neatly dressed, light gowns of white, of pink and of other summers shades predominating.  A great many of the children carried a little bag or basket of lunch, and occasionally the big boy of the schoolroom was found lugging along a big basket that contained provisions enough to keep the pupils of his grade from getting hungry during the day.</p>
                            <p>Along the line of march to the exposition's north entrance several of the exposition guards were stationed, and as the children went by the guards sang out:  "The train leaves tonight at 8:30 o'clock sharp.  Lost children will be found at the guard house."  That made the girls of 16 real mad.  Who would ever think that they would get lost.  They very idea made them highly indignant, and they quickened their steps a bit.</p>
                            <p>The crossings of the street car tracks and of the Missouri Pacific railroad tracks were carefully guarded, and Manager Babcock was here, there and everywhere, seeing that the children were well looked after and keep out of danger's way.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">Getting Through the Gates.</head>
                            <p>In front of the exposition gates the squads were lined up while the chaperon went over to the ticket window and bought enough tickets for the American youth under her particular care.  She was not afraid to leave them alone, as each child was promptly tagged and could be readily identified as a part and parcel of the children's excursion.  The tickets purchased and distributed, the children were fairly hustled through the gates.  A half dozen guards helped to handle them, and Andrew Jackson Webb acted as a steering committee of one to keep one gate from being overworked.  The children were put through in about fifteen minutes, and this time could have been cut in half had the two idle windows intended for the sale of tickets been occupied.  But as it was the big excursion was very well handled clear into the exposition grounds.  "On the Midway they had never strayed," but the 750 soon made up for this great lack in their early years, and promptly took in everything on both sides of the Midway.  As the crowd was running along enjoying the sights and scenes the Department of Transportation surrendered the care of the children for the day, to be resumed on the return trip in the evening.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Several Thousand People Witness a Most Realistic Exhibition of the Methods Used in Aiding Ships and Men in Danger.</head>
                            <p>A crowd of fully 5,000 intensely interested people saw the initial exhibition given by Captain Knowles' crew of the United States Life Saving service on the lagoon at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon.  The performance was a very satisfactory reproduction of the actual work of the service, and judging by the enthusiastic approval that it elicited it will be one of the most popular features on the grounds during the remainder of the season.  Not one in a hundred of the people who were massed around the mirror had more than the vaguest possible idea of the manner in which Uncle Sam's life savers perform their perilous task, and this was a practical demonstration that amounted to a revelation to this western crowd.</p>
                            <p>The general interest that the anticipation of the performance has aroused was apparent in the immense crowd that packed the entire main court from the Government building to the bridge.  Even the roofs of the <choice><sic>collonades</sic><corr>colonnades</corr></choice> were utilized by spectators and the formation of this end of the court was so well adapted for the purpose that everyone was able to obtain a good view of the exhibition.</p>
                            <p>At the hour when the drill was to begin everything around the station was in its normal condition.  The lifeboat was mounted on the ways in anticipation of a possible alarm.  The patrol was out as usual in each direction and the remainder of the crew was at rest.  Then a sailor appeared on the mast in the lagoon and in another minute the signal of distress was fluttering at its peak.  The patrol instantly signaled the supposed vessel that assistance was at hand and then ran <choice><sic>wiftly</sic><corr>swiftly</corr></choice> to the station to give the alarm.  The crew turned out like a hose company on a general alarm and manning the beach apparatus ran it swiftly around the lagoon to a point in front of the Government building and directly across the mirror from the mast.  In a couple of minutes the boom of the gun was heard and the small lines was hurled directly over the yard and close to the mast, where it was grasped by the sailor.  He drew it in hand over hand, hauling up a heavier rope which carried a whip and tackle.  This was bent to the mast and with its assistance the crew on shore rapidly ran out the big hawser, which was in turn attached to the mast about two feet above the whip.  On this last line the breeches buoy was run out and the sailor was quickly rescued from a position that would have been perilous had it been in a storm-lashed sea instead of on the quiet water of the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The rescue was vigorously cheered by the crowd but the next feature of the drill was even more interesting.  The rescued sailor now played the part of the unfortunate who escaped drowning only through the efficient work of the crew.  He rowed to the center of the mirror in a small boat, where he good-naturedly allowed himself to be capsized.  The alarm was given and while he gave a realistic exhibition of a green swimmer overwhelmed the crew raced to the lifeboat.  The blocks were kicked away and with a united push it went scurrying down the ways and out into the lagoon.  The surfmen caught on somehow before it got away and by the time the craft had steadied itself in the water they had the oars out and were pulling away for the spot where the exertions of the swimmer were rapidly growing feebler.  Before they reached him he had thrown up his hands and gone under but the surfman leaped from the bow of the lifeboat and soon brought him to the surface unconscious but still breathing.  He was bundled into the boat, which then pulled for the landing.</p>
                            <p>At this point the drowned sailor was left out of the reckoning for a few minutes while the crew gave the crowd an exciting exhibition of the manner in which a lifeboat can be handled in the water.  Their work at the oars was in itself a sufficiently attractive exhibition to the landsmen who had never seen the perfect rhythm with which a trained crew handle the blades.  Then the oars were shipped and in a second the big craft whirled bottom up with the crew clinging to the ropes inside.  But it came up again with equal ease, the men were at their places in a trice and in another second were pulling away as though <unclear reason="torn"/> several times, to the enthusiastic enjoyment of the crowd.  Then they recollected that they had a drowned man somewhere on board and the boat was pulled to the landing, where the victim was laid out on the pavement and the process of resuscitation illustrated.  In the absence of a barrel one of the surfmen laid flat on the pavement while the unconscious mariner was rolled over him to let the water exude from his interior.  At the same time the other men were at work rubbing his limbs, slapping the soles of his feet and working his chest and arms to restore respiration.  The happy result was accomplished at last, the sailor came to life, the apparatus was run back to the station and the surfmen retired to exchange their dripping garments for dry clothing.</p>
                            <p>The drill is wonderfully realistic from first to last.  It will be repeated every day except Sunday at the same hour.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Harrison Wild of Chicago Manipulates the Instrument.</head>
                            <p>The concert given last evening at the <choice><sic>Expositio</sic><corr>Exposition</corr></choice> Auditorium by Mr. Harrison Wild, organist of Chicago, and the exposition chorus, under the direction of Mr. Thomas J. Kelly, drew one of the largest audiences that has graced any performance in that temple of the divine art since its opening.  It was plainly evident that the patrons of the exposition are once more ready for a taste of real music and the enthusiastic applause that followed every number is an encouraging sign that love of music is not dead in this longitude; indeed, it is not even sleeping.  The opening of an organ is not nearly as inviting a prospect as the opening of a number of other things that appeal to the taste of the genus homo, but a vast concourse of people assembled within doors to hear the new organ, whose advent has been long looked for and earnestly desired by many.  It is a noble instrument, possessed of a rich tone, a large variety of stops and a pleasing exterior.  It is a pity that it was not ready for use while the Thomas orchestra was here, as in conjunction with it a variety of musical compositions could have been rendered that would have been interesting and instructive to those who are accustomed to attend high class performances.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wild is an artist of the first rank.  He has long been known as one of the leading organists of Chicago and besides is a thorough musician.  His playing gave evidence of abundant technic and a conception of the character of each selection that only comes with natural talent united to profound musical knowledge.  His program included selections from the works of Bach, Guilmant, Batiste, Buck, Chopin, Wagner, Brewer, Wely and Rossini; surely a variety which would appeal to all tastes.  His pedaling was especially commendable and also very noticeable.  A curtain should be hung before the pedals, for the sight of a couple of feet wending their devious pathway up and down the keyboard will turn even a Back fugue into comedy.  As one selection Mr. Wild played a set of variations by Dudley Buck on "The Star Spangled Banner," which distorted that well known highly respected melody out of all likeness to its natural self.  It looked as if the arranger tried to show off a knowledge of counterpoint and harmony and toward the end a sort of fugue was introduced (but soon dropped) that reminded one of Bach, especially and only when one remembers that in German "bach" means "brook" and a brook is full of runs.</p>
                            <p>The work of the chorus reflected much credit on Mr. Kelly and was characterized throughout by accuracy, truth to pitch, variety of shading and volume of tone.  The arrangement of "Annie Laurie" was enthusiastically encored, but not repeated.  The conductor risked his success by an abrupt accelerando at the close, which was neither musicianly nor effective, but the previous good work secured for him a forgiveness for which he should be grateful.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wild was several time recalled, but owing to the length of his program, played no encores.  He has made a large number of friends by his musicianly playing and by a cordial manner that few public men have been able to preserve through years of success.</p>

                            <p>The Omaha terminal lines have agreed on reduced rates for the excursions that are expected to come in from the west about the middle of next month to celebrate Colorado day, Montana day and Utah day at the Transmississippi Exposition.  There is no doubt but that the reduced rates and time limits agreed on by the Omaha terminal lines will be put into effect.  The opposition of other lines to reasonable rates to this city for the exposition is growing less effective every day.</p>
                            <p>The rate for these days will be 1 cent per mile, in each direction, and on all of the tickets there will be a limit of fifteen days allowed.  This limit will allow the excursionists more time to visit the exposition than has been granted travelers on former state days.  Colorado day will be September 9; Montana day, September 12, and Utah <choice><sic>da</sic><corr>day</corr></choice>, September 14.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Spectacular Appearance of the People of All Races on the Midway.</head>
                            <p>The parade of the Midway establishments united with the Indian congress yesterday afternoon was a feature of sufficient spectacular interest to entertain even the regular exposition visitors, who were familiar with the spectacles it included.  To those who had never seen them before it was an attraction of the highest order and it presented a varied succession of gorgeous costumes that filled the main court with color.  The brilliant attire of the Orientals, the more somber habiliments of the Chinese and the gaudy paint and blankets of the Indians contributed to give the ensemble a picturesque effect that could scarcely be improved upon.</p>
                            <p>The parade formed on the boulevard and the West Midway at 2 o'clock and soon after it started down Twentieth street, on which it passed through Administration Arch and around the main court to the starting point.  Phinney's band headed the pageant, followed by General Manager Clarkson, who officiated as marshal, and Manager Akoun of the Streets of All Nations and Manager Cummins of the roller chair concession has assistants.  The Midway attractions followed and nearly all of them were represented.  The people of the Streets of All Nations made an especially imposing turnout.  The swordsmen and gun spinners marched on foot, the dark Oriental beauties in their striking costumes following in jinrikishas, while the other show people were mounted on a cavalcade of camels and donkeys.</p>
                            <p>The Streets of Cairo made a creditable and very similar display and the Chinese village was represented by its full complement of people dressed in their holiday attire and accompanied by their peculiar brand of music.  The Old Plantation darkeys marched in full force and the Wild West show furnished a small army of rough riders in cowboy costumes, together with their band.  The German village and Pabst's both stopped entertaining the crowds inside long enough to assist in the out of door demonstration.  The other Midway attractions represented were Hagenbeck's, Chiquita, Shoot the Chutes and the ostrich farm.</p>
                            <p>The second division was headed by the Indian band and was in charge of Captain Mercer and Bill Liddiard.  It was composed entirely of the inhabitants of the aboriginal encampment and it constituted by far the biggest feature of the parade.  It was the first time the Indians have paraded on foot, but the feature was fully as effective as when most of them were mounted.  The change gave the people a better opportunity to compare the stature and physical characteristics of the various tribes, while their costumes were no less striking.  After the return from the round of the main court the Indian countermarched on Twentieth street and gave the crowd a full opportunity to complete its inspection.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Infant Incubator and Its Place in the Economy of Life.</head>
                            <p>From a scientific standpoint the baby incubator on the exposition grounds is attracting considerable attention.  Members of the medical profession are becoming interested in its workings.  The affair started only yesterday, but during the entire afternoon and evening the house in which the incubator is located was crowded.  The incubator is a glass and metal case heated to a certain temperature.  Into this enough air is admitted to maintain life in the infant until such time as it is strong enough to come in contact with the temperature of the room.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday two prematurely born infants were placed in incubators and the heat was turned on.  They were carefully watched over by the physician in charge and last night he was certain the little things would live, providing they contracted none of the complaints or diseases to which children are subject.</p>
                            <p>The baby incubator is the patent of a German physician.  It is contended that 85 per cent of the infants sent to the incubator have lived and become healthy children.  The concern on the grounds is <choice><sic>opertaed</sic><corr>operated</corr></choice> more for scientific than for exhibition purposes.  It is intended for the rearing of the weakly born babies, who under ordinary circumstances soon pass away.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Captain Mercer Will Make that Display a Feature of the Congress.</head>
                            <p>So well pleased with the result of the sham battle between the Indians and the whites is Captain Mercer of the Indian congress that he has decided to make them regular features at stated intervals.  No date has been fixed for the next one, but it is more than likely that it will occur during the present month.  Another thing that Captain Mercer has decided upon and that is, in the future, he will use only Indians in the fights.  The movements and action of the whites in the battle of Wednesday was satisfactory to the captain, but he thinks that better results can be secured by putting only Indians into the field and allowing them to conduct a regular Indian campaign.</p>
                            <p>Some time ago it was decided to have regular programs of the afternoon dances <choice><sic>engeged</sic><corr>engaged</corr></choice> in by the Indians, but it has been found that it is next to impossible to arrange a program that can be carried out in all of its details, consequently Captain Mercer has abandoned the idea and has concluded to allow the Indians to select their own dances after reaching the grounds.  This will not prevent the giving of dances, however.  Each afternoon some tribe will dance and will do so without interference.  The first experiment in this line was tried yesterday afternoon and it worked well, pleasing the public very much.</p>
                            <p>Shortly after 4 o'clock, after viewing the work of the life saving crew on the Lagoon, the Indians were marched to the encampment, where the Omahas gave the celebrated corn dance, which at the agency is put on to show their appreciation of the goodness of the Great Father in producing a big yield of corn.  To the average white man this dance differs little from the grass dance.  The musicians sit in the center of the field and beat upon their drums.  After the noise has continued for some five minutes, a score of Indians, who heretofore have been sitting on their haunches, jump into the ring and bedaubed with paint commence hopping around, imitating kernels of corn upon a hot griddle.  This continues until the dancers are about exhausted, when other Indians take their places and the fun goes on without intermission.</p>
                            <p>The Indian congress is rapidly growing in favor with the public and the attendance is daily growing larger.  More Indians are expected within the next few days.  Captain Mercer has received word a party of Sioux from Pine Ridge are on the way and are due to arrive any day.  He is also expecting a delegation of the Seneca Indians from New York, but just when they will get here is uncertain.</p>

                            <p>While Missouri has no state building upon the exposition grounds, there is a place where the people from that commonwealth are made to feel at home.  The men in charge of the Montana building have extended an invitation to all of the Missourians to call and participate in an acceptance of their hospitalities.  The invitation was sent out a few days ago, and yesterday the St. Joseph people in the city accepted in full force.  They arrived early and stayed late.  They were made welcome and when they left they felt just as well as though they had a building of their own.  From this time on, the Montana building will be headquarters for all delegations from Missouri.</p>

                            <p>Hon. A. W. Smith, state senator from McPherson county, Kansas, is in the city for a few days, visiting the exposition.  Speaking of the exhibits, he said:  "They are as fine as anything that I have ever seen.  The display in the Horticulture building furnishes the most conclusive evidence that the Mississippi and Missouri valleys are destined to be the great fruit raising sections of the country.  A few years ago it was supposed that fruit could not be raised west of the Mississippi river, but the exhibition here proves that all of the fruits of the temperate, and many of those of the semi-torrid zone will grow here in abundance.  The other exhibits at the exposition are equally good, and those in the Agricultural building are extra fine.  Right here I want to say that the exhibits of grain are the best that have ever been brought together."</p>

                            <p>Fred W. Averill, one of the exposition visitors from Kansas City, has the record of being the greatest joiner in the country.  He belongs to fifty-four lodges and secret societies and in addition to attending all of the meetings of the orders, he finds time to run for office.  He is the republican nominee from the Fifth senatorial district of Kansas City and says that his chances of being elected are excellent.</p>
                            <p>Joe Abrahams was arrested on the exposition grounds yesterday, charged with larceny.  He was accused with stealing a watch from a tailor shop at Fourteenth and Harney streets.</p>
                            <p>Some days ago complaints reached Major Llewellyn of the exposition guards to the effect that people visiting a long maned horse were being short changed by the parties handling the cash at the concession.  A watch was put upon the place and yesterday B. F. Emery, the spieler and cashier, was arrested, charged with defrauding the public.  He was taken to the local station and subsequently removed to the city jail.</p>

                            <p>The board of directors meets today and a quorum is confidently counted on, as a large number of the directors are anxious to have the 25-cent night rate put into effect at once.</p>
                            <p>The efficacy of the reduced rate was well shown yesterday, as on previous nights when it has been in effect.  The day's receipts at the gate were $4,977.25.  Of this amount, approximately $4,000 was taken in at the 50-cent rate before 7 o'clock, and $1,000 at the reduced rate in the evening.  As the regular evening admissions are merely nominal on an aver-<unclear reason="torn"/>
                            
                            <pb n="47" xml:id="TMISB06-047"/>
                            
                            and aside from the financial feature, it was responsible for the presence on the grounds of 4,000 people, or just about one-third of the entire paid attendance of the day.  The Midway percentages derived from these extra 4,000 people will amount to several hundred dollars more.</p>
                            <p>The exhibitors are strongly in favor of the reduction, while the concessionaires are a unit in that direction.  The forty-two big exhibits in the Horticulture <choice><sic>bulding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice> are unanimously in favor of it, and thirteen of the sixteen big state exhibits in the Agriculture building have declared for it.  Nearly all the exhibitors in the Manufactures building have signed a petition asking for it, while the business judgment of the directors seems to be overwhelmingly in favor of immediately putting the 25-cent rate into effect at 6 o'clock each evening and closing all the exhibits buildings at that hour.</p>

                            <p>The matter of also closing the exposition on Sunday will come up in this connection.  Sentiment on that point does not seem to have crystallized, and the majority seem to want a little more light on the question, but in the matter of evening admissions it looks very much like a 25-cent rate in the future.</p>
                            <p>Beginning tomorrow, visitors to the Hawaiian exhibit in the Agricultural building will be served free with genuine Hawaiian coffee and bread fruit.  The growing coffee and cocoanut feature attracts a great deal of attention, while much interest is manifested in the whole exhibit from this most lately acquired possession of Uncle Sam.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee yesterday decided to extend an invitation to D. Augustus Staker of Detroit to deliver the oration at the exposition on Colored People's day, August 17, 18 and 19.  Steps were also taken to provide the necessary ammunition for future sham battles, as Captain Mercer is arranging to put on two of these events each week.  Five thousand rounds of 44, 45 and 50 caliber rifle and revolver blank ammunition were ordered.  The committee will hold its meetings after this week only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>
                            <p>The "From Battlefield to Fireside" program has been ordered again for this evening, with fireworks effects.  It is stated that this will be its final presentation.  The executive committee was induced to have it presented once more by the numerous requests of frequent visitors, with whom the number has been constantly increasing in favor.</p>
                            <p>Special commissioner R. W. Richardson returned yesterday morning from Chicago.  He saw Ferd W. Peck, the newly appointed commissioner to the Paris exposition.  Mr. Peck sails for Paris about <choice><sic>Septembmer</sic><corr>September</corr></choice> 1, but will come here again to look over the exhibits, with an eye to securing some of them for Paris in 1900.  Robert J. Thompson, the special press commissioner to that exposition, is now in Washington, but will be here next week for the same purpose.</p>

                            <p>"That is worth more than all we have seen today," said a visitor as the parade of All Nations passed under the Administration Arch yesterday afternoon; and he voiced about the general sentiment, judging from expressions heard from others.  It was, as far as the Midway was concerned, a repetition of the parade on the Fourth of July except that, as the procession was around the lagoon and the brick pavement would not bear heavy loads, no vehicles were allowed.  An exception was made of the tiny carriage of Chiquita.</p>
                            <p>It was better than the Fourth of July parade because it had the 300 Indians now encamped on the grounds.  Everyone in the camp turned out and the Flandreau Indian school band led this division.</p>
                            <p>The whole procession was led by the Phinney band.  It came down the Twentieth street boulevard and moved once around the lagoon, the Indians then being turned about to go to the Government building again to witness the exhibition of the life saving crew.</p>
                            <p>The line of march was thronged with the unusual number of people on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent of Buildings Banker for the board of education is putting in the machinery necessary for the live exhibit of manual training for the high school.  This will be in the gallery of the Manufactures building, and Prof. Wigman says that in a week he expects to have ten boys there actually at work showing what is done in this department in the high school.  Most of the machinery has been offered free for the summer by eastern firms.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Formal Opening of the Organ in the Auditorium.</head>
                            <p>The Auditorium at the exposition last night held the largest audience that has ever assembled in it, the occasion being an organ recital by the famous organist of Chicago, Harrison Wilde.  In many of his selections Mr. Wilde was very pleasing and in other barely fair.  The first selection was rich in the devotional element of Bach.  The simple melody recurring again and again in the pastorale of Guilmant was pleasingly brought out, and the offertoire from Batiste was brilliant and sweet.  Chopin was weak and draggy, while the Wagner number was slow and lacking in the fire and brilliancy it should have received.</p>
                            <p>The "Autumn Sketch," by Brewer, was another number which delighted, and "Communion," by Batiste, was rich with harmonies and deep religious devotion.  In Mr. Wilde's interpretation it seemed to run the whole gamut of religious feeling, from the simple prayer to the ecstatic emotion of one wrapt in vision before the altar.</p>
                            <p>The exposition chorus rendered three numbers, and so well did they distinguish themselves that they were loudly applauded after each one.  The rendering of "Annie Laurie" especially touched the hearts of the audience.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Reasons Why It Is Thought Every Day Will See a Large Attendance.</head>
                            <head type="sub">End of War, Low Rates, Special Days and Harvested Crops---Outline of Program for Lumberman's Day.</head>
                            <p>The exposition has been enjoying something of a boom in attendance in the last two weeks, and the management is beginning to think that the period for big crowds every day has <choice><sic>arrrived</sic><corr>arrived</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>This is for several reasons.  One is that the war is over.  About the only effect of the war on the exposition has been that it has so monopolized space in the newspapers of the country as to keep out any considerable mention of the exposition.  Now that the fight is over more will be said about the next biggest thing, and that is the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Another reason is that the summer has advanced to the point where the brunt of the farm work is over.  The crops have been good and the country people will feel like having a little pleasure, combined with instruction.</p>
                            <p>Another reason is that the state and special days will come thick and fast.</p>
                            <p>Still another and perhaps the most important is that the low railroad rates have already been granted by one road and certainly will be by one more and probably by all.</p>

                            <p>September 9th, the day of the ninth month, has been chosen by the lumbermen of Omaha to entertain visiting lumbermen on the Trans-Mississippi exposition grounds.  An attractive program has been prepared, specially low railroad rates have been secured, and there is no doubt the occasion will be a notable success.</p>
                            <p>A log-rolling contest on the lagoon, in which a number of the leading expert log-rollers of the country will take part, is billed for 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  Four prizes are offered and the contest is open to all comers.  Twenty-four inch logs will be used.  The judges have been selected from among the wealthiest mill owners in the United States, and include such men as Charles A. Weyerhaeuser of the Pine Tree Lumber company of Little Falls, Minn.; J. B. Phelps of the Lindsay &amp; Phelps Lumber company of Davenport; F. L. Murray of Wisconsin Lumber company of Hayward, Wis.; Eugene Shaw of the Daniel Shaw Lumber company of Eau Claire, Wis.; L. K. Baker, manager of the J. S. Stearns Lumber company of Odanah, Wis.; John S. Owen of the Rust-Owen Lumber company of Drummond, Wis.; Thomas H. Shevlin of the Shevlin-Carpenter Lumber company of Minneapolis; H. C. Akeley of the H. C. Akeley Lumber company of Minneapolis; Charles A. Goss of the Winona Lumber company of Winona, Minn.; and James T. Barber of the Northwestern Lumber company of Eau Claire, Wis.</p>
                            <p>At 7 p. m. on the grand court, there will be a parade of Hoohoos in the grotesque Hoo-Hoo costumes.  At 8:30 a brilliant display of fireworks will be given on the north tract, the pieces including a "black cat" and other appropriate figures.  After the fireworks a concatenation will be held in the Minnesota building.</p>
                            <p>All the attractions on the Midway have made reduced prices of admission for visiting lumbermen.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska lumbermen will act as hosts during the day and will keep open house at the Nebraska and Minnesota buildings.  Down town headquarters will also be established at the Commercial club rooms at the corner of Sixteenth and Farnam streets.  Visiting lumbermen can obtain badges from members of the reception committee at the depots or at the Commercial Club rooms, the Nebraska building, or the Minnesota building.</p>

                            <p>There will be unusually elaborate and beautiful fireworks on the north tract tonight as part of the celebration of St. Joseph day.</p>
                            <p>August 31 has been set as the special day for the Loyal Mystic Legion of America.</p>
                            <p>September 12 has been fixed as South Dakota day, when the state officials and a large number of citizens will be present.</p>
                            <p>The every day noon drill of the fire company on the grounds is watched with much interest by visitors to whom a metropolitan fire service is new.  The horses are released from their stalls by electric apparatus, are hitched to the wagons and run out of the building.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Gaston Akoun, proprietor of the Streets of All Nations, received a telegram yesterday from Victor Roditi, Coney Island, to the effect that the great show, Streets of India, is coming to Omaha to participate in the entertainments at the Streets of All Nations famous.  The attraction at the gay island consists of Japanese acrobats, pyramids, and elephants, and camels, the two latter of which give all kinds of performances.  Mr. Neimy, the manager of the Streets of All Nations, assures the public that this show has never been presented in any previous exposition or place of amusement of any kind.  Among the new attractions at the Streets this week are the merry-go-round, the sword dance by beautiful girls, the electric act on the stage and the wonderful Japanese juggler and balancer, to say nothing of the fire eater and La Bell Rosa in her wonderful dance, balancing a heavy chair between her teeth, presenting an entirely new act, never seen in this country before.</p>

                            <p>"Mister" Rosewater again entered the ring yesterday afternoon to settle the mooted question of who is at the best man&#8212;the "Mister" Rosewater aforesaid or the exposition board of directors.  At the end of one very brief and equally bloodless round the gong saved "Mister" Rosewater as he was being counted out, and the referee declared the bout a draw, and ordered its continuance to a finish next Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>"Mister" Rosewater had previously threatened that he would die upon the spot until he was thoroughly and completely dead, so far as the exposition was concerned, unless the board jumped over the ropes and hit the back trail, but after the decision of the referee, he "consented" to live until Monday afternoon at twenty-two minutes after 4 o'clock, at which hour he is determined that one or two things shall happen&#8212;either the exposition's X-ray will be extinguished in a grand finale of Rosewaterian fireworks or the Rosewater beacon will be set blazing on the topmost pinnacle of the Administration Arch, no more to be dimmed until October 31.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MR. ROSEWATER BALKS.</head>
                            <p>It will be remembered that "Mister" Rosewater was ordered by the board to send two passes to every country paper in the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota.  "Mister" Rosewater said he knew more about it than fifty directors, and declared he wouldn't do it.  Inasmuch as he takes great pride in keeping his word upon certain occasions, "Mister" Rosewater did not send them.  Next he was ordered to send passes to the editor of the Labor Bulletin, but the editor of that paper had unfortunately remarked in print that the exposition was bigger than the Bee building, and "Mister" Rosewater was moved to remark that he would not serve another day as press pass dispenser until the outrageous affront was recalled and the "insulting action of the board was rescinded."</p>
                            <p>The board had its "dander" up at that time, and as it was about to grasp "Mister" Rosewater by the slacks of the pajamas and the loose cuticle at the base of the cerebellum and waft him with much swiftness and unerring certainty through the transom, he "consented" on his own motion to pause on the brink of his resignation.  His "consent" carried him over to yesterday, when he stood up in full view of the directors and solemnly announced that the fateful hour had arrived.</p>
                            <p>He had come to the parting of the ways and had brought the exposition along with him.  He pointed out to the directors the twin vistas stretching into the future, and assured them that if they wanted to go along peaceably down his road he would see that they did not want for employment.  He would keep them all busy pulling his chestnuts out of the fire, and they could earn an honest living.  On the other hand, if they tackled the other road they would have to go without him, and they would find it rocky sledding.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HEAVENS DO NOT TUMBLE.</head>
                            <p>The directors were momentarily appalled at the prospect, but "Mister" Rosewater relieved their apprehension by intimating the he had not yet firmly made up his mind to close up the exposition.  If they would rescind their former resolutions relative to directing the work of his department all would be well, for he would "consent" to longer abide with them.</p>
                            <p>"Mister" Rosewater sat down, but the building did not even tremble.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock moved that the bureau of admissions be instructed to send out the passes previously ordered, in accordance with the former action of the board.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lindsey remarked that no one in the bureau of admissions knew the names of the papers in the states named.</p>
                            <p>"I will see that they are furnished you within forty-eight hours," replied Mr. Hitchcock, "if this is the only way to get out the passes."</p>
                            <p>And then Mr. Rosewter went into the air.  As he struck the floor he yelled:  "That shows Mr. Hitchcock's ignorance of this whole business.  He knows just about as much about this as he did about the work of his department when he was a member of the executive committee.  There must be something decisive about this done now.  I have been carrying on this work for two weeks under protest and it has taken all my time.  I never worked so hard in my life as I have about this pass question, and you must rescind your action or I won't go on with it another day.  I am tired of it anyway."</p>
                            <p>"This board has had this <choice><sic>wholem atter</sic><corr>whole matter</corr></choice> under consideration," said Mr. Hitchcock.  "The action complained of was taken after prolonged discussion covering <choice><sic>seevral</sic><corr>several</corr></choice> meetings, and it was reached by a decisive vote.  This man has defied the whole board and declared that he would not carry out its instructions.  He has not sent out the passes ordered, and now he says he wants to retire.  My motion is in accordance with the condition of affairs and provides for placing this work where it will be performed in compliance with the directions of this board."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">LITTLE EDITOR'S EGO.</head>
                            <p>"Mister" Rosewater again struggled to the surface and loudly announced in a low voice:  "I do want to retire, but&#8212;but&#8212;I want you people to know what a big load it is that you will undertake if you try to attend to these <choice><sic>passses</sic><corr>passes</corr></choice>.  Who have you got that is competent to do this if I let it go?"</p>
                            <p>"Mister" Rosewter reached into his think tank and felt anxiously around for another idea tending to show the directors why they could not afford to grant his request and allow him to retire, when Mr. Wharton, who is a member of the society that makes a specialty of preventing cruelty to dumb creatures, proclaimed with much gusto that there was no quorum.</p>
                            <p>Other members insisted that there was, <choice><sic>an</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> the president announced after counting noses that there were twenty-seven on hand.  Two members of Mr. Wharton's society took the cue and quietly slid out of the room.  The point was again raised, and a controversy ensued as to the number present.  In order to make things sure, Mr. Babcock jumped through the doorway, but was collared by Mr. Webster and brought back.  A roll call was taken, but it showed one short of a quorum.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>An adjournment was therefore ordered until 4 o'clock Monday afternoon.  "Mister" Rosewater "consented" to extend his "consent" until that time, and then rushed into the anteroom and took a large muscular pill out of a box prescribed by his doctor for acute heart disease.  He finally went down the <choice><sic>levator</sic><corr>elevator</corr></choice> with one hand firmly grasped in the other ,as he was unwilling to demonstratively shake hands with himself in public, though he was firmly convinced that he had a handshake <choice><sic>comin</sic><corr>coming</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>Prior to "Mister" Rosewater's ebullition, the board had a tussle with the reduced rate problem, and decided that every Thursday evening until the close of the exposition should see the 25 cent rate in effect after 6 o'clock.  Mr. Hitchcock moved for a straight evening rate at that figure, and it was strongly supported, but amendments for test weeks at that price, and for various other experiments were sprung, and the Thursday evening rate was finally agreed on as a compromise.  A motion to try the reduced rate for one week was lost by a vote of 14 to 20, and a motion to make Sunday rates 25 cents was lost by a vote of 10 to 17.</p>
                            <p>Those in favor of the low rate announced their intention of continuing the <choice><sic>compaign</sic><corr>campaign</corr></choice> in that direction.</p>

                            <p>The first watermelon and Hubbard squash of the Douglas county product was introduced yesterday into the county vegetable display at the exposition.  The samples are very fine and their presence in the show ring announces to the public that from this time forward Douglas county market gardeners are prepared to supply the market with these varieties.</p>
                            <p>The East Omaha market gardeners are able to supply watermelon, muskmelon, squash, sweet pumpkin and everything in the line of vegetables as soon as they are to be had anywhere in this climate and the management of the county display is on the lookout for the first of everything that is grown.</p>
                            <p>The finest display of tomatoes that has yet been presented to the exposition visitors is now in the Douglas county vegetable department.  This exhibit consists of one dozen tomatoes of the Pondorosa variety grown at 2812 Poppleton avenue, Omaha.

                            <p>August 24 is World-Herald day at the exposition, the management having voted to set apart that day in honor of the World-Herald.</p>
                            <p>For that day the railroads will sell special low rate round trip tickets from all parts of Nebraska and from the western parts of Iowa.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee has also voted a special 25 cent night rate for the evening of World-Herald day.</p>
                            <p>The railroad rate for World-Herald day asked for by the exposition management is one fare for the round trip, less 20 per cent.</p>
                            <p>At noon upon World-Herald day the World-Herald will serve a lunch to Nebraska editors and their wives at the Markel restaurant.  To this lunch several hundred invitations have been sent out and a large number of acceptances are expected.</p>
                            <p>During the evening the editors and their wives will be entertained as guests of the World-Herald upon the Midway and several special entertainments will be provided for them.</p>
                            <p>World-Herald day has been designated for August 24 to celebrate the thirteenth anniversary of the establishment of the Evening World, which later consolidated with the Morning Herald and became the leading newspaper of Nebraska.</p>

                            <p>Thirty-five thousand people have been mystified with the Haunted Swing since the first day of June.  This swing has made more than 4,000 revolutions and everybody has been invited to examine it closely, yet no man, woman or child has been able to explain the mystery.  An Indian concluded to make some examinations yesterday and now he is at home for awhile.  When the swing started on its round he grabbed the iron shaft and suspended himself there until the swing stopped.  When he found an opportunity he broke through the door and made a bee line for the reservation.  He don't understand the workings of the swing and probably never will.  Indians are curious, so there are about 500 of them contemplating a trip to the dark thing.</p>
                            <p>The entire Yankee nation is of the "want-to-know" type of humanity.  Perhaps that alone is the keynote to American progress.  The public's constant desire for information becomes monotonous and often oppressive, especially when a continuous stream of people ask the same questions repeatedly.  A man employed in the Streets of Cairo kept a record of the questions asked him in one day, with this result:  "What time does the show begin?"&#8212;268 times;  "Where are these people from?"&#8212;210 times.  "How old is that camel?"&#8212;112 times; "How long can the camel go without water?"&#8212;72 times; "Is that the way they marry in Egypt?"&#8212;31 times; "What makes the people do that way?"&#8212;50 times; "Do they think that is music?"&#8212;22 times.

                            <head type="sub">Hint From Omaha Terminal Lines to Western Passenger Association That Time for Fooling Is Passed.</head>
                            <p>The "hint" on the subject of exposition rates which the report of the meeting of passenger officials of Omaha terminal lines will be to the Western Passenger association will not be quite so strong as the hint of the man who, not desiring the presence of a neighbor kicked him out of the house, but it will be fully as meaning, and it is confidently expected will be fully as successful in accomplishing results.</p>
                            <p>For Montana, Utah, Colorado and South Dakota days the Omaha terminal lines recommend exactly the rates asked for by the exposition directory and Commercial club committees two weeks ago, and the recommendation of which by the Omaha terminal lines at the Western Passenger association meeting in Chicago Wednesday caused such a rumpus.  For the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben parades and carnival low rates were also recommended.  Then the meeting deliberately recommended the same rates for the Firemen's tournament which it recommended before and which the Western Passenger association has twice refused to approve.</p>
                            <p>The situation on exposition rates, as explained by one local passenger man whose knowledge of the matter and reliability cannot be questioned, is briefly this:</p>
                            <p>The Omaha terminal lines do not desire to create any trouble and they have done all in their power to avoid demoralization of rates.  At the same time they are determined to put in lower exposition rates, the matter of doing so having been absolutely settled at the meeting Thursday afternoon.  In order, however, to treat all lines in the Western Passenger association in the most courteous manner possible the Omaha terminal lines have decided not to take any further action, aside from that taken at the meeting Thursday afternoon, until after the meeting of the Western Passenger association in Chicago the first of next week.  But it has also been absolutely decided that should the Western Passenger association again refuse to approve the rates recommended by the Omaha terminal lines then they will at once notify the association of their proposed action and will put in the rates asked for by the exposition and Commercial club committees, and already recommended by the Omaha terminal lines.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The largest excursion that has come here for the exposition from any one city is that of the St. Joseph visitors to the exposition, arriving here this morning.  Over 1,200 representatives of the thriving city of the lower Missouri came in on three trains over the Burlington road, and nearly as many more over the Missouri Pacific railroad.</p>
                            <p>The first train to arrive pulled into the Burlington station at just 10:37, after having made the fastest run between St. Joseph and this city ever covered by an excursion train.  The train left St. Joseph at 7:12 o'clock, and ran the 140 miles in three hours and twenty-five minutes.  It was a heavy train, the twelve coaches being filled to their seating capacity.  As soon as the train had come to a standstill, the Central (colored) band of St. Joseph marched out from the rear coach playing that old familiar song which predicts a real warm time in some old town during the evening.  After the band and the flag-bearers came Dr. Kirschner, mayor of St. Joseph; M. M. Riggs, comptroller; P. P. Kane, chief of the fire department; John Broder, chief of police; Fred Hyde, city attorney; John Casteel, city counsel; John Gilkey, city treasurer, and sixteen members of the city council.  The car occupied by the city officials was decorated on both sides with banners, on which was painted "City Officials, St. Joseph, Mo."</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores, City Clerk Higby, Comptroller Westberg, Treasurer Edwards, Health Commissioner Spaulding, Councilman Mount, Stuht, Bingham, Bechel and J. H. Adams, secretary to the mayor, were the representatives of the Omaha city government on hand to extend a fraternal greeting to the municipal officers of St. Joseph.  After introductions all around had been made, and the party made well acquainted, a dozen open carriages were driven down a ramp and filled with the officials of the two cities, who were driven directly to the exposition grounds.  The band was sent out to the grounds in charge of the mayor's messenger.</p>
                            </div3>              
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">There Were Some Others.</head>
                            <p>In addition to the city officials there were about 500 other people from St. Joseph on the first section of the excursion train.  General Passenger Agent Wakeley of St. Louis and Division Passenger and Freight Agent Marshall of St. Joseph, both of the Burlington lines in Missouri, were on hand to see that the visitors were well taken care of and properly directed.  The excursionists were a fine appearing lot of people.  They were well dressed, and said they didn't care just so they had a good time.  Each excursionist wore a little red badge with "St. Joseph" stamped on it, the ribbon being held in place with a button, on which appeared a little porker, and this query and answer:  "St. Joe Rooters.  Are We in It?  Watch Us."</p>
                            <p>While the band was playing a few popular airs in the large waiting room of the station and the first party of excursionists were getting acquainted, the second train rolled in.  It arrived at 11:23 a. m., and consisted of eight well filled cars.  They left St. Joseph fifty minutes after the first train.  The third lot of St. Joseph citizens came in on the regular train, the "Exposition Flyer," at 12:05 p. m., having left St. Joseph at 8 a. m.  The first train brought in 600, the second 450, and the third about 150.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Over the Other Line.</head>
                            <p>While the city officials of St. Joseph were coming in at the south end of town the business men of that city were storming the north walls.  They entered from the exposition terminal station of the Missouri Pacific and made a notably strong showing.  There were nearly as many of them as came in down town and they represented the St. Joseph Commercial club, the Wheeler Manufacturing company, Tootle, Wheeler &amp; Metter, the Weed Manufacturing company, John S. Brittain, the Perfection Pump company and a few other of the leading commercial and manufacturing industries of St. Joseph.</p>
                            <p>The business men came in on two special trains, the cars of which were handsomely decorated with banners and flyers, telling "who we are."  The first train was made up of twelve cars, and the second carried eight coaches.  In the two trains were somewhat over 1,000 excursionists.  The large number of business men and employes of business houses was secured through the liberal policy pursued by the proprietors of the leading houses.  Nearly all of them closed their stores and factories for the day and gave their employes railroad tickets and admission to the exposition.  One of the Commercial club men said:  "Yes, I guess we're all here.  We pretty nearly closed up the town today in honor of your exposition.  About the only people left at home are the invalids and the base ball team."</p>
                            <p>The two special trains filled with business men and their families came from St. Joseph to Hiawatha over the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island railroad and from Hiawatha to Omaha over the Missouri Pacific.  Both trains made good runs, leaving there at 7:30 and 7:40 o'clock this morning and reaching the exposition grounds a few minutes after 12 o'clock noon.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>St. Joseph assured the exposition officials some time ago that it proposed to give the biggest municipal celebration of the season and its people redeemed their promise today by coming fully 3,000 strong and bestowing enthusiastic approval on every feature of the show.  As the trains were somewhat late in arriving, the bulk of the crowd did not get on the grounds until afternoon, but from then on they constituted the most conspicuous feature of the attendance.  The presence of the visitors was celebrated by a short program at the Auditorium at 12 o'clock.  Although only a small proportion of the St. Joe delegation were in time to participate, the minority made a strong showing and exhibited a degree of enthusiasm that atoned for the empty seats.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles called the assemblage to order and announced that although the bulk of the crowd had not reached the grounds, the day was so far advanced that it was thought best to proceed with the program.  He introduced Mayor Moores, who delivered the address of welcome on behalf of the city of Omaha.  The mayor spoke in high terms of the enterprise and good fellowship that were alike characteristic of the people of St. Joseph.  He declared that the transmississippi region was fortunate in having on the banks of its great river a number of prosperous and ambitious cities that were doing their best to <choice><sic>develope</sic><corr>develop</corr></choice> the region by which they were surrounded.  The history of St. Joseph has been very similar to that of Omaha and it faces very nearly the same conditions.  Both have developed from pioneer trading posts into metropolitan proportions.  During ten years of hard times they have held their own and in the years to come they will be among the most prosperous and progressive cities on this continent.  In conclusion, he gave them a hearty welcome to the exposition, that is not an Omaha show, nor a Nebraska show, but an exposition of the products and resources of the entire west.</p>

                            <p>Mayor Kirschner of St. Joseph responded very gracefully to the remarks of Mayor Moores, and assured the hosts that the visitors would make liberal use of the freedom of the city that had been so hospitably tendered.</p>
                            <p>The St. Joseph band played a brief selection, and then President Wattles spoke briefly in behalf of the exposition management.  He eulogized the active part taken by citizens of Missouri in the incipiency of the enterprise.  All through the difficulties that beset its progress many assurances of good will were received from our neighbors on the south, and not the least grateful of these from the city that is so largely in evidence on the grounds today.  Continuing, he spoke in enthusiastic terms of the limitless resources that were represented in this exposition.  The west is in its infancy, and while we boast of its commerce and wealth today, we have only a glimpse of the possibilities of its future.  With its splendid opportunities for acquiring wealth the west must become the most populous part of the country, if not of the world.  This exposition assists us to appreciate the vast possibilities of the future and will bring capital and population to every part of the transmississippi region for many years to come.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion President Wattles briefly sketched the growth of St. Joseph, complimented the vigor and enterprise of its citizens and made them cordially welcome to the transmississippi show.</p>

                            <p>Since the conclusion of peace is assured the exposition management has begun active preparation for the grand Peace jubilee which will celebrate the event.  It was determined some time ago that if peace was declared before the exposition closed it would be made the subject of a great celebration, and immediately on the announcement that the protocol had been signed at Washington, President Wattles and Manager Rosewater took the matter actively in hand.  At a conference this morning with Senator Thurston it was decided that the jubilee should be held during the week of October 9 to 15.  This will afford ample time for preparation, and the week will be made the premier period of the exposition.  On September 3 a committee, consisting of Senator Thurston and Allen, Congressman Mercer, and at least three members of the exposition directory will call on President McKinley to secure his consent to be present, with the members of his cabinet, and participate in the celebration.  Letters have also been addressed to the governors of all the transmississippi states and territories asking them to join in the invitation to President McKinley, and it is confidently believed that by that time the international atmosphere will be so far cleared that he will be able to make the trip.</p>

                            <p>At a conference this morning between Senator Thurston and President Wattles of the exposition arrangements for the celebration of Government day, September 20, were largely completed.  The invitation to congress to participate in the event reached the house of representatives too late for formal action, but the senate has appointed a committee of fifteen, of which Senator Thurston is chairman, to represent it at the exposition.  The members of that committee will all be here on Government day, as well as a large number of congressmen and other government officials.  The main program of the day will be held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock.  President Wattles will deliver an address in behalf of the exposition and a number of senators, to be hereinafter selected by Senator Thurston, will respond.  An especially elaborate musical program will be rendered by the Mexican band and the exposition chorus.  Immediately following the exercises the distinguished guests will be tendered a banquet at the Casino at which the senators who did not speak in the morning will respond to toasts.  There will be an exceptionally brilliant fireworks display in the evening.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Captain Mercer Plans Some Special Entertainments for the Public.</head>
                            <p>Plans for some attractions in which the Indians on the grounds will amuse and interest the public are being matured by Captain Mercer.  Since the recent Indian battle he has taken exclusive charge of the amusement features of the camp and will put up an interesting program in the near future.  He will do away with battles in which whites and Indians will participate and at the same time he will allow the Indians to participate in such dances as they see fit.  This decision with reference to the dances will prevent giving notice in advance <choice><sic>at is</sic><corr>as it</corr></choice> will be impossible to tell just what the Indians will do until they reach the grounds.  It is certain, however, that dances will be given each afternoon at 2 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>During the next few days Captain Mercer will conduct an Indian school of instruction at which rehearsals will be the features.  These will continue until the Indians reach a certain degree of proficiency, after which they will appear in public in which might properly be called a drama.  There will be several sensational acts, all of which will be new and prepared especially for the occasion.  In the first place the captain will put on a little play in which he will portray the scenes and incidents around the Indian camp just prior to the young men leaving for the front, where they go to do battle with an enemy.  There will be all of the events of camp life, the squaws and Indian bucks working on the war equipment, the preparing the ammunition, sharpening of the knives and the manufacture of the war bonnets and leggings.  While this will be supposed to cover a period of several days in reality it will consume but a few minutes, or hours at the most.  Following this there will be the scenes attending the return of a victorious war party.  There will be the coming of the braves, the reception when they reach the camp and the feast, the whole ending with a grand dance in which both squaws and warriors will participate.</p>
                            <p>On another occasion the Indians will give a correct representation of a war party that has fought and lost.  There will be the return and the sorrow that attends such a return will be manifested in true Indian style.  In connection with this there will be the services held in observance of the death of the warriors killed in battle.  There will be the burial exercises, together with the mourning for the dead.</p>
                            <p>At intervals during the fall Captain Mercer will put on battles and skirmishes, but they will all be between Indians.  In order to carry out his plans he has made a requisition for rifles and blank cartridges, which will arrive during the next few days.  In arranging these contests he will divide his Indians into parties so that the timber and mountain Indians can do their fighting in the brush and under the trees in the center and at the west end of the grounds, thus leaving the plains Indians to show their skill in the opening around the east end of the grounds.</p>

                            <p>Even the children admired the fruit and yesterday the Horticulture building was crowded from morning until late at night.  Anticipating the large attendance, the men in charge of the exhibits had brightened up their plates and their contents, so that everything presented a pleasing appearance.</p>
                            <p>The Illinois people sent in a large quantity of fruit that was placed on exhibition for the first time.  Most of it came with J. W. Stouton, who is manager of the fruit display and who has been at home during the past three weeks working up enthusiasm in the exposition.  Mr. Stouton is something of a fruiter himself, having 100 acres in orchard and more than 2,500 bearing trees.  He is showing much fruit of his own raising, including apples and peaches, with a fine collection of pears.  His Bartlett pears are as fine as were ever seen, some of them being as large as coffee cups.  Just as an illustration of what can be done, he is exhibiting some branches that contain as high as six pears growing in one cluster.  He also brought from his home some Sickel pears, the only ones exhibited up to this time.  While they are small, they are fine flavor and nicely colored.  He is calling particular attention to Willow Twig apples that have been in cold storage since last fall.  They are as sound as apples just picked from the trees and as finely colored.  E. Tucker of Richville,  Ill., has sent on a  fine collection of peaches that are attracting much attention.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the horticultural exhibits of the exposition, Mr. Stouton said:  "I think that it is a good if not better than was shown at the World's Fair.  The varieties are greater and the quality is equally as good, notwithstanding the fact that this is something of an off year with fruit.  We shall keep our exhibit up to the highest standard until the close of the exposition.  Our farmers and fruit growers are taking a deep interest in the fruit exhibit and have promised that they will keep our tables supplied with all that is necessary."</p>
                            <p>The exhibitors in the Horticulture building have another kick coming.  They say that the rule adopted by the exposition management relative to the delivery of fruit is working a great injury to the displays that they are making.  The fruit is all delivered at the warehouse at the north side of the grounds and later in the day is hauled about and distributed.  What the exhibitors want to have done is to have the fruit delivered at the gate just west of the Georgia state building each morning.  They say that if they are allowed to received their consignments there they can have the fruit all in place on the tables before the arrival of the crowds.</p>

                            <p>Some of the Apache Indians from the San Carlos agency in New Mexico are getting anxious to get home.  They like the exposition and the attractions, but they are not in love with the Nebraska climate.  These Indians come from a climate that is devoid of humidity.  They are not accustomed to rains, dews or clouds and every little shower drives them to distraction.  They are without tents, as in their country they have no need for them.  They live wickiups, constructed of boughs and when it rains, they might as well be out of doors as in the habitations which their dwelling places afford.  When it has rained, Captain Mercer has hurried them into the houses along the north line of the camp, but these they do not like, as in them they feel about as much at home as a cat in a strange garret.</p>
                            <p>One peculiar thing about the Apache Indians is that they are nearly all afflicted with consumption, and the moist climate of the north is about as fatal to them as yellow fever.  They all cough and even in their own country, consumption causes more deaths than all of the other diseases combined.</p>

                            <p>The celebrated Mexican band, the official band of the Seventh regiment of artillery of the Mexican government, arrived direct from the City of Mexico at 9:50 o'clock this morning and was escorted to the exposition grounds, where the musicians were provided with transportation into the grounds during their stay in the city.  There are forty-two pieces.  Ricardo Pacheco is the leader.  M. Venta is in charge to look after the welfare of the members.</p>
                            <p>The Seventh Regiment band is the pride of the Mexican army and is regarded as the best musical organization in the republic.  It is considered better than the Mexican band that played an engagement at the World's fair in Chicago in 1893.  The first concert will be given tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>Two men, giving the names Fred Harris and Dan Clark, were arrested in the Government building yesterday afternoon.  They were taken to the city jail and charged with being suspects.</p>
                            <p>Additions are being made almost daily to the Douglas county exhibit in the Agriculture building.  New wheat that yields thirty-five bushels per acre is shown and any quantity of new potatoes, cabbage, melons, tomatoes and general garden truck has been put into the booth during the last few days.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the light rain during the early evening the concert on the lagoon was something of a failure.  Few cared to stand out and listen to the music, while still fewer of the members of the band and chorus cared to play or sing in a drizzling rain.</p>
                            <p>In a private letter to a friend in this city a resident of Findlay, O., says: "Every billboard is posted with exposition advertising; the hotels and depots display posters and literature to the exclusion of almost everything else.  As soon as the rates get down to a reasonable figure I am coming, and there are others."</p>
                            <p>Mr. and Mrs. H. O. Bursum and bride of Socorro, N. M., are in the city on their wedding trip.  While here they are the guests of Captain Leeson, who is in charge of the New Mexico exhibit.  They are much pleased with the exposition and will remain several days.  Mr. Bursum is the sheriff of Socorro county.</p>
                            <p>Ever since the opening of the exposition the majority of the people have been compelled to guess at the names of the aquatic plants in the pool in front of the Horticulture building on the bluff tract.  Things, however, have changed and now all of the plants are arranged so that cards giving the names have been placed in close proximity.</p>
                            <p>E. H. McCutchen, a banker at Holstein, Ia., is spending several days in the city visiting the exposition.  Speaking of the show, he said: "It is much better than I expected to find it.  The exhibits are very fine and there are plenty of them.  While it is not so great an exposition as the World's fair, I think that in many respects it is much better."</p>
                            <p>Major Clarkson has scheduled the noon hitching of the fire department horses as a daily attraction.  Yesterday notice of this went upon the bulletin boards for the first time and when the hour arrived there was a great crowd around the doors of the engine house.  The noon hitching is a regular thing with the firemen, but with the crowds it is a good drawing card.</p>
                            <p>September 12 has been designated as South Dakota day and the commissioners from that state are arranging for its proper celebration.  It is expected that a very satisfactory railroad rate will be secured and that a large party of South Dakota officials and citizens will visit the exposition on that occasion.  Wednesday, August 31, has been set aside for the celebration of the Loyal Mystic Legion of America.</p>
                            <p>The state poultry exhibit on the north tract, just west of the Transportation building, is not coming on as well as was anticipated.  Some of the fanciers have put in their exhibits, but more are holding off until later in the season.  At this time there are only a few of the pens occupied, but next month when the weather cools off it is expected that there will be a fine lot of fowls shown.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Opinions Concerning the Probable Effect on Exposition Attendance.</head>
                            <head type="sub">RAILROAD MEN UNANIMOUS ON THIS</head>
                            <head type="sub">End of Hostilities and Military Operations Will Give the Public Time to Visit Omaha and the Transmississippi Fair.</head>
                            <p>Following are some expressions of local opinion on the probable effect of the end of the war on business in general and exposition attendance in particular:</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston:  The exposition will certainly feel the quickening impulse of the establishment of peace, just as business of all kinds will feel it.  It is well and favorably known to the people of the east, and they only need the relaxation of the interest in war to bring them west to look at the exposition.  I look for large numbers of them out here during the months of September and October.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Frank E. Moores:  We can look for a decided improvement in the attendance as a result of the declaration of the peace, especially of people from the east.  The papers throughout the country, particularly those in the eastern part of the country, have been running "Santiago" or "Manila" or "Porto Rico" at the top of their columns ever since the exposition opened.  Now that there will no longer be any occasion for this the newspapers will naturally fall back upon the next biggest event in the world's history and devote their space to the Transmississippi Exposition.  The result will be that people who have had no time to devote except to the reading of war news will read about the exposition, and, reading of its magnitude, will journey west to see it.</p>
                            <p>Herman Kountze:  The effect of peace ought to be good for the exposition.  The war has so absorbed the attention of eastern people that they have overlooked or forgotten the exposition.  This can in a measure be remedied now, and they will have an opportunity to read of Omaha, and they may decide to come out.</p>
                            <p>Judge W. D. McHugh:  I look for an increased attendance now that the war has come to an end.  The newspapers will devote more space to the exposition, for there will not be so big a demand upon them by news of the war.  What we ought to have now is a big peace jubilee.  There is no more appropriate place or time for such a celebration than right here in Omaha in connection with the exposition, which is supposed to represent the pursuits of peace.  I would favor a public meeting at once to bring this about.  Do not make it an adjunct of the exposition, but an independent affair, of national scope, to which the president of the United States might come without fear of being used as an advertising card.  This should be done at once, and it seems to me it could be made a success.</p>
                            <p>John Francis, general passenger agent of the B. &amp; M.:  The negotiation of the peace treaty cannot but have a very beneficial effect on the exposition.  With the close of the war, the newspapers of the country will have space for something else besides war news, and I believe will devote much more attention to the exposition.  During the remainder of the exposition I believe we'll be able to attract more attention to it than we have up to this time.  The people will think of something else besides war now that it is over, and the exposition should come in for a large share of their attention.</p>
                            <p>John A. Kuhn, general agent of the Northwestern railroad:  The negotiation of peace means increased activity for the railroads.  With the revival of commerce the railroads must necessarily be benefited.  I believe we shall have increases both in freight and passenger traffic.  The finish of the war should result in greater crowds of visitors to our exposition, and I believe it will.</p>
                            <p>J. W. Munn of the Elkhorn's passenger department:  Certainly the close of the war will help the exposition.  The people will have something else to think about besides the war, and we'll be better able to impress them with the great attractions we have here.  I look for much greater attendance during the remaining months of the exposition than if the war had kept on.</p>
                            <p>A. Darlow of the Union Pacific passenger department:  It will unquestionably be of great benefit to the business of the country, especially to the railroads, as we will now be compelled to figure on hauling back the troops which we recently carried to the front.  It will also increase other lines of travel, and necessarily that will inure to the benefit of the exposition, bringing more people to the west and to this city.</p>
                            <p>City Comptroller Westberg:  It is a fact that ever since the war has opened the people of the United States have displayed no desire to pay any attention to anything in the way of amusements.  The bad success that has attended pretty nearly everything in the amusement line fully attests to this.  With the war over the American people will turn to something else to distract their attention and as they are an amusement-loving people they will naturally turn to something that will give them enjoyment.  Attendance at various places of amusement will pick up, and, as the exposition is the biggest show in the country, a big number will naturally watch this and will finally be induced to attend themselves.  The result will be an increased attendance.  The next two and a half months ought to be big ones.</p>
                            <p>City Clerk Beecher Higby:  I believe that the ending of the war will result in an increased interest in the exposition throughout the country.  With this increased interest will come a desire to see the show itself and the result will be a bigger attendance.  The people of this country have been so engrossed in the progress of the war that they have had no time to devote to anything else except possibly their own business.  With their minds taken off the war problem they will turn again to the affairs of this country and the first object they will light upon will be the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Henry W. Yates:  I think that without doubt it will prove to be a good thing for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>John C. Cowin:  It must surely help, for it will attract the attention of the people from war, and give them an opportunity to think of enterprises connected with peace.</p>
                            <p>General Solicitor William R. Kelly of the Union Pacific:  The war is over, and I suppose fighting has ceased.  But there are battles of diplomacy yet to be waged, and upon their results depend important interests of this nation.  In negotiating peace conditions this country has greater responsibilities, it seems to me, than it has ever before encountered in its history.  It has now to deal with some new problems, and I have faith enough in the government to believe they will be solved to the credit and the ultimate good of this country.  The close of war means renewed activity throughout the country; first, in shipbuilding; secondly, in manufacturing and thirdly, in agricultural pursuits.  One of the first results of the war will be the upbuilding of the American merchant marine.  With the opening of new markets to our goods I believe there will be a wonderful revival in American shipbuilding, and American products will again be carried in American bottoms.  There will also be a large increase in our manufactures, especially in the iron and steel trade.  I am confident that we shall see increased investments and operations in agriculture.  This country is now entering on a wonderful era of prosperity.  Confidence has been restored, and with the conclusion of the peace negotiations money that has been hoarded will come out to seek investments.  The subscription of $1,200,000,000 by the people of this country when a war loan of $200,000,000 was called for proved conclusively that there was money here just waiting for investment.  The fact that nearly $100,000,000 was withdrawn from circulation and deposited in the form of certified checks as earnest money without ever affecting the financial situation demonstrated how sound a financial basis we were working on.  With these facts before us and the assured activity in manufacturing, commercial and agricultural industries I cannot see but that the outlook is very bright.</p>
                            <p>J. H. Millard:  The exposition ought to be benefited.  What I want now is to see about four regiments of soldiers camped at Fort Omaha.  It ought not to be difficult to get them, or at least a <choice><sic>partion</sic><corr>portion</corr></choice> of that number, so the people of the west can see the men who have been fighting the country's battles.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Taylor, in charge of the Horticulture building:  I think that the end of the war will help the exposition more than anything that could have occurred.  It will give the people an opportunity to think and read of something else than battles.  It will relieve the strain and will start the flow of money.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Wilson, in charge of the California exhibit:  It certainly means much for the exposition, and ought to start travel toward Omaha.  People will feel easier and will feel much more like spending their money.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Greef of the Kansas commission:  The close of the war with Spain means a boom for the exposition.  With peace assured, people will let loose of the money that they have been hoarding, and they will begin to travel.  From now on the attendance at the exposition ought to increase at a tremendous rate.</p>
                            <p>General Manager Clarkson:  It is the biggest thing that could have occurred, so far as benefiting the exposition is concerned.  Now the crowds will begin to move this way and the great papers of the cities will give us space.  In the past the war news crowded <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield:  With the coming of peace, the financial success of the exposition is assured.  People will now give time to other things than war and will move in this direction.  The exposition will get more space in the press and will be more talked of both at home and abroad.  The declaration of peace ought to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Register of Deeds Crocker:  It shows that we have a man at the head of the nation who knows his business.  It is all right.  Our turn with the exposition comes now to show what peace also has done for progress.</p>
                            <p>County Superintendent Bodwell:  I am satisfied with whatever the administration does.  The country is safe with Mr. McKinley.  War and peace are both object lessons of advancement in our country.  We have the latter in our exposition.</p>
                            <p>President Kierstead of the Board of County Commissioners:  It demonstrates what wise conservatism will do.  Mr. McKinley has surprised the world.  The war has been conducted in a most humane manner and brought to a speedy conclusion with the best of terms.  National attention will now turn to the progress of industry and peace exemplified by the Omaha exposition.</p>
                            <p>Clerk Albyn Frank of the district court:  The object of the war has been successfully carried out and the result is in every way satisfactory to me.  I believe the attention of the country now will be directed to the victories of peace and the achievements of industry, and that the Transmississippi Exposition will now be the center of interest.</p>
                            <p>Deputy Sheriff John Lewis:  I have the fullest confidence in whatever the administration does.  Mr. McKinley has shown himself a broad-minded statesman and a humane victor.  Of course, the people will begin to flock to the exposition now.  Hitherto their attention has been taken up too much by the war to stop to consider the value of peace and its achievements in industry, art and science.</p>
                            <p>President Charles E. Winter of the Nebraska State League of Republican Clubs:  The republican party has demonstrated that it is always the safe party, whether in peace or war, and even the opponents of Mr. McKinley are forced to praise his cool-headedness, conservative judgment, and humane tactics.  His manner of conducting the war has astonished the world and made Europe blush.  Now the party, having proven its fitness in a most trying time, will have easily sailing through a period of peaceful development.  As for the exposition, why of course the termination of the war will be a big thing for it.  The public mind will now have some room for a proper regard for the value of the triumphs, nearer home, of peace.</p>

                            <head type="sub">General Expression of Opinion Shows a Sentiment Against Making the Night Tariff Less Than the Day All the Time.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>From now until the end of the exposition 25 cents will purchase an admission to the grounds after 6 o'clock every Thursday night.  This was decided on by the board of directors yesterday after a protracted discussion in which the sentiments expressed were largely in favor of a reduced admission for at least one night in the week.  An effort to make a flat evening rate of 25 cents every night in the week was voted down, as was also a motion to make the Sunday admission 25 cents during the remainder of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The question of reduced admissions was raised by a petition signed by 250 exhibitors and forwarded by the Concessionaires club, in which the board was requested to make a flat evening half rate in order to promote the local attendance.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock moved that hereafter the rate should be 25 cents after 7 o'clock every night.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Lee suggested that the hour should be changed at 6 o'clock, and after this had been accepted there was a general and exhaustive discussion of the various questions involved.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lindsey declared that it would be a mistake to open the gates at half rates every night.  He was willing to favor a proposition to make that rate for one or two specified nights in each week, but the Hitchcock resolution was too radical.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock declared that if one or two nights were selected it would create confusion in the public mind and might detract from the attendance on the other nights.  He contended that a thorough test of the value of the concession could not be secured unless it was made to apply to all night admissions.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="52" xml:id="TMISB06-052"/>
                            
                            <p>E. E. Bruce vigorously opposed the 25 cent proposition and quoted figures at length from the records of admissions to justify his position.  These indicate that on the Sundays when the reduced rate had been in effect the gate receipts from percentages on concessions were sufficiently increased to offset the difference.  He also quoted figures on evening admissions which purport to show that the percentage of evening receipts is no greater at 25 cents than on evenings when the full rate was charged.  This brought out the explanation that the figures given refer to the admissions after 7 o'clock when the 25 cent rate was in force, while those which he quoted for other days included the entire receipts after 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Some Actual Receipts.</head>
                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick also produced an array of figures which in his opinion conclusively established the advisability of the reduced rate.  For instance during the week beginning July 24 the receipts on Thursday when the low rate prevailed in the evening were $3,356.95, while the receipts on the other days ranged from $1,734.50 to $1.962.75.  On Thursday the evening receipts amounted to $800, thus disproving the assertion that the evening rate killed the daylight attendance since more money was taken in, exclusive of the evening admissions, than was received altogether on any other day of the week.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater declared that the bulk of the figures that had been presented to the directors were so completely juggled that they were valueless.  Even the monthly reports consisted of a mass of statistics that did not show anything.  The figures are probably correct as the books go, but there has never been a report submitted that an intelligent bookkeeper could understand.  As a matter of fact, certain members of the executive <choice><sic>committe</sic><corr>committee</corr></choice> did not want the 25 cent rate to be a success.  The fact is that on the 25 cent nights when the weather is favorable there are immense crowds of people on the grounds.  As far as the 25 cent Sundays are concerned, they have never had a thorough trial.  The first Sunday it was unbearably hot, and the next was too cold for a large attendance.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater also called attention to the fact that the statements of receipts that were cited are misleading and delusive in that they purport to show the actual receipts from the gates and the concessions.  As a matter of fact receipts that had been secured on account of new concessions granted are included in these showings of daily percentages.  He was not prepared to vote for a 25 cent rate every day in the week.  He favored it for Sundays and for one or two nights in the week.  Whatever action was taken should be decided on at once and made permanent for the change of policy on this point had caused much confusion on the part of the public and made enemies for the exposition.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles opposed a 25 cent rate from start to finish.  It would detract from the dignity of the exposition, and have a tendency to bring the rough element of the city to the grounds in the evening.  He alluded to the movement in its favor as due to the influence of the concessionaires and declared that several of the directors were interested in various concessions.</p>
                            <p>Herman Kountze opposed the resolution on financial principles.  The exposition must be just before it becomes liberal, and in his opinion it will be more likely to pay its debts if the admission is maintained at 50 cents.  He would vote for one 25 cent night in each week as a concession to the people who could not afford to pay 50 cents to visit the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater replied to the statement of President Wattles relative to the interest of directors in concessions by remarking that, as far as he knew, Mr. Metz was the only member who had a direct interest in a concession and he voted against every proposition that contemplated a reduced rate.  He added that he had as great an interest in seeing the debts of the exposition paid as any member of the board.  But he believed that the best way to accomplish this result is to throw the gates open for 25 cents on Sunday and on one evening during the week.  As a matter of fact the people do not come to the grounds in the evening to see the exhibits.  Several of the most popular buildings are closed at 6 o'clock and it was seldom that 500 people can be found in the buildings after that hour.</p>
                            <p>The debate continued at length and finally John C. Wharton moved as a substitute that the admission be fixed at 25 cents every Thursday night during August.  Mr. Montgomery offered an amendment to the effect that it be tried every night for one week, but this was voted down by 20 to 14.  On the suggestion of Mr. Rosewater, Mr. Wharton then changed his motion to make the Thursday night rate continue until the end of the exposition and it was carried by 22 to 12.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith moved that the same re-<unclear reason="torn"/> of the exposition, but this was voted down after considerable discussion.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Passes to the Press.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then brought up the pass question and stated his position relative to the action taken by the board at its previous meeting.  He said that the resolution adopted by the board had made it impossible for him to continue to act as pass distributor.  At that time he had given notice that he would not serve in that capacity any longer and he had accordingly turned the matter over to President Wattles.  At the end of two days at the urgent request of President Wattles and the executive committee he had resumed the task, but with the distinct understanding that unless the resolution was rescinded at this meeting he would decline to do the work any longer.  The executive committee had formulated rules by which the issuance of passes were governed.  But this board had taken it into its own hands to vote passes in opposition to these rules and after he had declined to issue them.  The action of the directors would seem to convey the idea that they did not consider him competent to discharge the duties of the position and he was very willing to turn the work over to some one else.  It was a most disagreeable task at the best and not an occupation to be desired.</p>
                            <p>Continuing, Mr. Rosewater called attention to a statement of the number of passes of various kinds that had been issued which had been promulgated by Manager Lindsey of the Department of Admissions.  He declared that this statement displayed the same perversity of bookmaking that was shown in other things.  It showed that 2,100 passes of series H had been issued to members of the executive committee, of which 650 were charged to him.  The interference was that these passes had been given to him for his personal distribution.  As a matter of fact, he had not used over thirty passes on his own account since the opening of the exposition gates, when each member of the committee is entitled to fifty passes a week.  He had no passes to give to his friends, as other members of the committee are doing, but those that passed through his hands went to representatives of the press who were personally entitled to them.  He had himself paid time and again the admissions of friends who expected him to favor them with passes, but whom he did not feel free to accommodate.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Matter Still Unsettled.</head>
                            <p>By this time it was 7 o'clock and a number of directors were anxious to adjourn.  Mr. Hitchcock moved that the Bureau of Admissions be directed to issue passes as required by the resolution passed at the last meeting, but Mr. Lindsey suggested that if this was done it would be necessary to take some immediate action to provide for handling the work that Mr. Rosewater would no longer undertake.  There is no one connected with the Department of Admissions who is capable of doing it and it would be necessary to employ some competent newspaper man at a good salary.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton remarked that it is evident that the board made a mistake in adopting the resolution in the first place, and during the discussion that followed it was discovered that there was no quorum present.  Consequently no action was possible and at the solicitation of the members Mr. Rosewater consented to handle the work until Monday afternoon, when the board will meet in adjourned session to take some definite action.</p>

                            <p>Phinney's band played its farewell concert last night.  At the conclusion of the last number on the program Prof. Phinney briefly addressed the audience, expressing the thanks of the organization for the courtesy shown during the six weeks' engagement, and stating that the members would go forth as forty-five representatives to talk for the exposition.  As a special number the band then played "Auld Lang Syne," and a large number of recently-made friends pressed forward to shake hands and say good-bye.  During the day the members were each presented with a boutonniere by Mrs. Frederick H. Cole.  The band leaves this evening for Chicago.</p>
                            <p>B. F. Emery, spieler at the Long-Maned Horse concession, who was arrested for "short-changing" visitors there, and who admitted to the police that he had made it a practice ever since being on the grounds, was released from custody temporarily pending argument in the case.  He is again at work at his old job, notwithstanding the fact that the concessionaire was advised of the facts.  The officers of the guard are determined to put a stop to the imposition on the public and to that end have written a letter to the executive committee stating the facts, and asking that steps be taken at once to prevent the continuance of <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>W. S. Streeter of Minneapolis has been selected by the investigating committee as the expert accountant to examine and check up the books and accounts of the exposition.  He will begin his work tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>The exposition guards appeared yesterday in new helmets.  They are of gray, and the regulation police style, with light leather trimmings.  The guard presents a vastly improved appearance with the new headgear.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston and Congressman Mercer were on the grounds yesterday, accompanied by parties of family friends.</p>

                            <p>An afternoon session will be held at 3 o'clock down town.  It will be either at Creighton hall or at the First Congregational  church, both of which have been tendered for down town meetings.</p>

                            <p>The St. Joseph excursion has opened the eyes of the management as to what railroads and advertising will do.  The St. Joseph committee secured a rate of $1.75 for the round trip, when the one-way fare is $4.05.  In order to get it, however, it insisted that the exposition department of transportation keep its hands out of the matter, as it had been advised of what rates to expect in that event.  It has secured an extension of the time to five days, and a number of the visitors will remain until the middle of the week.  The visitors desire to make public expression of their appreciation of the efforts of H. G. Getchell, chairman, and Messrs. Ed C. Wild, E. A. King, A. H. Wehrman and A. J. Enright, members of the committee of arrangements.  It is stated that the great result of this excursion will be a continuous low rate from St. Joseph during the remainder of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Last evening's fireworks display was one of the prettiest since the opening of the exposition, and 8,000 people crowded the inclosure on the north tracts to witness and applaud it.  The visitors declared it to be a fitting close of a memorable day, and said that it filled them with pleasant anticipation of many enjoyable days to come.</p>

                            <head type="sub">At the Same Time the Directors Decide to Take a Hand in the Advertising.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Dr. Miller to Be One of Two to Awake the East to a Knowledge of the Exposition.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Weak Head of the Department of Publicity Given a Slap on the Pass Question--Events on the Grounds.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There was the hottest kind of a powwow on the exposition grounds yesterday, but it wasn't located in the Indian camp nor anywhere near Captain Mercer's bailiwick.  It was in the executive committee room in the Administration Arch, and the cause of the outbreak was the unannounced visit of Directors Kountze, Murphy and Webster, who called to ascertain why the exposition was not being advertised.</p>
                            <p>The visitors put Manager Rosewater of the department of publicity and promotion on a red-hot skillet and the way they made him perform was something awful.  Rosewater sought to defend his department and insisted that the advertising received was all that could be expected, but the callers wouldn't be bluffed and told him plain that the situation was all wrong and that there must be a change.  Mr. Kountze had been east, and he knew what he was talking about when he said nothing was known there about the exposition, and he did not hesitate to so inform Mr. Rosewater in a few short sentences that were right to the point.</p>
                            <p>The other members were equally outspoken, and the department of publicity was given a churning that would have brought butter in record-breaking time, provided there had been any butter to bring.  The visitors then took the entire executive committee into consultation, and it was determined that something must be done.  Various plans were discussed, and it was decided that the best plan to adopt to remedy long standing defects at this late day would be to send two men east to take up the matter personally with the newspapers, and endeavor to secure the much needed space.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ROSEWATER'S REQUEST.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater had been rebellious, but when he say that the committee was determined about the matter he fell in with the plan, and when Dr. George L. Miller's name was mentioned as one that would have influence in the eastern newspaper world he suggested that he be sent along, too.  The suggestion was not kindly received, but no definite action was taken further than to draft a resolution to be presented to the board of directors at their meeting tomorrow, reciting the situation and providing for sending two press commissioners to the east.</p>
                            <p>The visitors also took Mr. Rosewater to task for not sending out the press passes as ordered, and told him in language much more vigorous than complimentary what they thought of a man who assumed to run the entire community and exposition, and overrule his forty-nine associates on the exposition directory.  Rosewater wiggled and twisted and squirmed, but there was no escape.  It was an executive session where no reporters were present, and there was no danger of the linen washing getting into print, so everybody felt free to talk, and the pent-up feelings of many long days were poured out with an abandon and <choice><sic>volumne</sic><corr>volume</corr></choice> that well nigh overwhelmed Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">RUBBED THE WRONG WAY.</head>
                            <p>It was an old fashioned "talking to," such as folk were wont to receive to good advantage in the long ago, and the talkers seemed to feel a whole lot better after they had eased their minds.  It did not serve to improve Mr. Rosewater's temper, however, for at a late hour last evening he was still as ugly as a bear with a sore head.</p>
                            <p>The board of directors is to be rounded up tomorrow afternoon and noses counted, to see whether or not the <choice><sic>expsition</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice> will break faith with the country publishers.  More than a month ago the publishers of country papers in this and all the surrounding states were notified that they were to be each furnished with two season passes to the exposition, and the announcement went a long way toward allaying the feeling of resentment that had been engendered by the policy that had hitherto been given full sway.</p>
                            <p>The direct result of the changed attitude of the publishers was manifest within two weeks, and there has been a constant increase in attendance since the papers began to call the attention of their readers to the exposition and urge them to visit it.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">EDITORS CATCHING ON.</head>
                            <p>Lately, however, the country publishers have discovered that the instructions of the board were not being carried out, and there are evidences of an unmistakable revolt all along the line.  Letters are being received in increasing numbers each day, and their tone indicates that an announcement that the exposition has been playing horse with the publishers is not wholly unexpected.</p>
                            <p>A fair sample of what is being received is the following from the Dubuque Herald, the oldest newspaper in Iowa, having been established in 1836:</p>
                            <p>Dubuque, Ia., Aug. 12, 1898.&#8212;World-Herald, Omaha&#8212;Dear Sirs:  Some weeks ago I saw in your paper that a spirited controversy was going on between the management of the exposition and Mr. Rosewater as to courtesies which were to be extended to the press.  My impression was that the management desired to be liberal with the press, and that Rosewater opposed it.  He must have carried the day, for notwithstanding we have published column after column about the exposition, not even a suggestion of tickets of admission have we received.  I don't know that we should use them if we had them, but the courtesy of the privilege would count for something.  If the press of eastern states have been ignored, as the Herald has been, no wonder you have taken Mr. Rosewater to task sharply and that other papers have joined in.  This is not written to find fault, but simply to give you a sample of how the press is served.  Yours,</p>
                            <signed>D. D. W. CARVER.</signed>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">BILL POSTING EAST.</head>
                            <p>A sample of what the situation is with reference to the eastern press is shown by the action of the executive committee yesterday in allowing $1,000 for bill posting in Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Baltimore and some other eastern cities, in order to get some information regarding the exposition before the public there, as the papers have turned the cold shoulder to the publicity department and consigned the execrable effusions of its press bureau to the waste basket with chilling unanimity.</p>
                            <p>In speaking of the situation yesterday one of the directors said:</p>
                            <p>"I am not in favor of breaking faith with the newspapers.  I do not think we can afford to do it.  We have said that the papers in this and surrounding states should have two passes each, and the least we can do is to keep our word.  So far as Mr. Rosewater is concerned if he will not do as he is directed by the board the work should be placed in other hands.  If we school ourselves to the belief that the whole exposition is wrapped up in him what an awkward boat we would be in if he should happen to die before the close of the exposition.  I cannot help thinking that even in the face of such a catastrophe as that the exposition would go right on.  I am not in favor of throwing him out if he wants to stay in and will abide by the declared will of the majority of the board, but I am not ready to concede that he knows more than all the rest of us put together, even about advertising matters.</p>
                            <p>"I happen to know a little about newspapers myself, and I know that neither Mr. Rosewater nor any other man knows personally about all these country publications.  Why, in sending out the matter to them from his press bureau, the stuff is mailed to lists made up from the American newspaper directory, and that is all he knows about them.  Can't any member of the board acquire as full and reliable information from that directory as he can?  So far as sending out those passes is concerned, if any one of the fourteen clerks in my office could not attend to that feature of the work as well as Mr. Rosewater can I would discharge him tonight.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">TYRANT'S RULE TIRESOME.</head>
                            <p>"With reference to the other work of the department it is different, and I see the need of a competent newspaper man to attend to that, but I made up my mind some time ago that the present system of doing even that is not what it should be.  This idea that there is no one else who can look after that work is the veriest rot.  I can stand Rosewater's egotism for two months longer if necessary, but I can't stand Rosewater's egotism for two months longer if necessary, but I can't stand any more of his apparent determination to overrule the whole board."</p>
                            <p>The Manderson street gates are being reset, so as to put them within forty feet of each other.  This is to better prepare for the use of the gates by the interested parties on either side of Twentieth, and completely do away with the annoyances that have heretofore existed.</p>
                            <p>The Sons of Veterans drum corps of Denver has notified the executive committee that it will be here on Sunday, September 11, for an engagement of one week.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Some one remarked this summer that it was a waste of money to provide good music at the exposition, as the public did not appreciate it, but preferred popular songs of the day.  This was somewhat on the order of country fairs and nowise complimentary to Omaha's visitors this summer, to say nothing of the reflection upon the musical taste of our own people.</p>
                            <p>Yet at the time this remark was made the Auditorium was being crowded for every performance, and the month of June was looked upon as a brilliant musical period.</p>
                            <p>The fact that good music always draws, even in wild and woolly Omaha, was evidenced again the last week when Harrison Wilde gave an organ recital.  The Auditorium was well filled and the audience was an enthusiastic one.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Mr. Wilde is certainly a good organist, and can bring rich harmonies out of that instrument, but his repertoire seems limit.  He is distinctly a church organist, and when he steps far outside of religious compositions does not display that ability which his selections demand.  Thus in the program last Thursday night Batiste's "Communion" could scarcely have been played better.  All the thoughts of the composed as he wrote his description of feelings which naturally would be excited by the devout worshiper as he knelt before the altar, were brought out, and one could trace his way through the quiet prayers, the exalted devotions of the communion and the joyous thanksgiving and songs of praise.  The clear, cold faith of Bach was well interpreted also.  Batiste's offertory was complete in its brilliant, semi-devotional theme, and Guilmant's "Pastorale" was charming in its simplicity.</p>
                            <p>But when the organist attempted the dreamy nocturne and the "Polonaise Militaire" of Chopin, the march from Tannhauser and the overture from William Tell, it was plain that he had little conception of the selections.  They were played without expression, were uninteresting and commonplace.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>While upon the subject of organ recitals the query may well be made:  Why, if it was necessary to secure some one from a distance to "open" the organ, the management did not send a few miles farther and secure a better.  Mr. Tabor is only a day's ride farther east, and certainly no better organist could have been secured.  The public knows his talent and would have run no risk in engaging him.  It is to be hoped that before the exposition is over he may be secured for a series of recitals.  The public would also like to hear the announcement that Mr. J. E. Butler has been secured for a similar purpose.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The public is also asking itself what motive the management had in sending away from home for an organist, when we have one equally as good in Omaha.  Those who have heard Mr. Butler's recitals find it difficult to imagine a reason.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Without wishing to make any discriminations or criticize the management, the public is also asking if it is necessary to confine the exposition to Chicago for artists.  Once, possibly twice, an artist who did not live in Chicago was engaged during the <choice><sic>jast</sic><corr>last</corr></choice> two and a half months.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There seems to be rather a careless way of doing business lately.  Thursday night only one door to the Auditorium was opened, and the large audience was banked up around the entrance, crowding and pushing their way in.  As each person was obliged to stop and purchase a ticket at the window in the vestibule, the operation of getting into the Auditorium was a difficult one.  Three other doors which might have been opened were locked.  Before another concert is given it is to be hoped that those in charge will change their policy and look a little more to the convenience of the public.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>As yet no announcements have been made as to what may be expected in September and October.  The fact that only simple music, patriotic airs, love songs and hymns were to be rendered during the summer was satisfactory, as attendants at the exposition were willing to give the musicians a rest through the hot weather.  But now that August is half over, they are beginning to wonder what will be upon the program next month.  June was such an exceptionally successful season in a musical way that Mr. Kelly will be put upon his mettle to surpass it.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>"Is Kelly still keeping up his whitewash concerts?" asked an illiterate fellow who had not been out to the exposition for a month.</p>
                            <p>"<choice><sic>Witewash</sic><corr>Whitewash</corr></choice> concerts?  What do you mean?" was the puzzled Yankee answer.</p>
                            <p>"Well, Kelly gives them a high toned name&#8212;calls them frescoing concerts; but it means the same thing."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Of all of the aboriginees represented at the Indian encampment at the exposition there is none more interesting or none about whom less is known than the tribe whose name our beautiful city bears.</p>
                            <p>Omaha, in the terminology of the Southern Sioux nation, means against the wind.  It is a corruption of Sioux and Dakota and was the name given to a branch of the united blood of these nations which seceded from the main body over a century ago.  Tradition has it that the Quapaws and the Omahas were at an early date one tribe located at the mouth of the Ohio river.  Internal strife disrupted the tribe and it became divided against itself, one portion emigrating down the Mississippi and the other up.  The southern section adopted the tribal name of Ogolipa and the northern that of Omaha.  At that distant day there was an old French trading post at what was formerly known as Cross Timbers, a big belt of cottonwood trees stretching across the Missouri river bottom about half way between Decatur and Tekama, this state, and near this point a considerable number of the Omahas took up their permanent residence, and to a greater or lesser degree have resided in the near vicinity ever since.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GRAND OLD MAN.</head>
                            <p>But it isn't of the origin of the Omaha tribe we wish to speak, but of an individual member who won distinction a half century ago both upon the war trail and in the hunt, and who today is a leader of the remnant of this once powerful nation now encamped with the representatives of other tribes upon the exposition grounds.  Wah-tun-nun-she is now a decrepit old man of 73, and bears little resemblance to the lithe young fellow who fifty years ago won his plumes in daring forays against the natural allies of his people, the treacherous and blood-thirsty Sioux, and the wiry and wary Pawnee.  It is said of Wah-tun-nun-she that he could follow the trail of an enemy across our great prairies at a full gallop on his pony with the unerring certainty of a bloodhound.  From his earliest manhood he was a leader in both war and the chase, and although he never rose to the dignity of a ruler of his people, his consul was never slighted on occasions of great moment to the nation.  He was a veritable prairie Arab&#8212;a matchless horseman, swift of foot and keen of eye, a dead shot with bow or gun, a great buffalo killer and intrepid brave.  He was known to and feared by both Sioux and Pawnee, and even to this day takes pleasure in exhibiting to you the tokens of his prowess in the eternal war that waged between them.</p>

                            <head type="sub">INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF.</head>
                            <p>At the big grass dance of the naked Assiniboines, Arapahoes and Cheyennes on Monday last, the writer held a long and interesting interview, through Interpreter Dan Martin, with Wah-tun-nun-she, in which he gave a graphic recountal of his capture and escape from the Sioux, of the three scalps he took, and the long hard ride out of the buffalo country to his home on the shores of the rushing Missouri.</p>
                            <p>Wah-tun-nun-she, enveloped in an old red and yellow blanket, was found squatted on his haunches just outside the outer circle of dancing braves.  He looked the ideal of an abject, broken-down old warrior, with a muskrat turban crowning his aged head, and the two big feathers of an eagle's wing depending from the thin gray locks that straggled from beneath his hairy headpiece.  There was a sad and morose look in his wrinkled face as he leered and blinked with his one eye at the evolving forms of his younger kinsmen in the mazes of Assiniboines summer dance of thanksgiving.  Wah-tun-nun-she was deeply interested, that could be seen at a glance, for every once in a while he would utter that short, quavering shout so peculiar to his people, and half rise on his palsied limbs as if determined to take part in the <choice><sic>wierd</sic><corr>weird</corr></choice> exercises of the warriors before him.</p>
                            <p>It was no easy matter to get the old brave to talk, and it was not until after the fact that he had lost an eye by smallpox, that he was 70 years of age, and was yet a strong man and big Indian had been cork-screwed from him in jerky fragments, that he became at all interested in our visit.  But when Martin tapped the long staff he carried in his withered hand and asked him about the tufts of long, black, <choice><sic>airey</sic><corr>airy</corr></choice> hair dangling there-from he braced up as if under the influence of some mystic elixir.  His one eye gleamed with the basilisk's light, the colors in his leathern face intensified, and with many gesticulations and many grunts of excitement and satisfaction, many bowings and bendings, he told us of his last fight with the Sioux, how he had killed two young warriors, and torn the scalps from their bleeding heads.</p>
                            <p>A multitude of fierce passions struggled in the old Indian's dirt and paint begrimed face, as he excitedly detailed his wild story.  Now inextinguishable hatred seemed to hold the mastery, and now a nobler expression, and one that better became the character of a chivalrous old Omaha warrior, took possession of his tawny features, and maintained itself until, first throwing aside his dingy blanket, and pointing to a seared scar in his breast, he <choice><sic>sad</sic><corr>said</corr></choice> in tolerable English, turning the light of his single eye upon the countenance of the writer:</p>
                            <p>"Waucouta&#8212;Sioux&#8212;arrow!"</p>
                            <p>Wah-tun-nun-she&#8212;the old brave's legend ran&#8212;in the fall of 1856, left the Omaha village on the Missouri with a band of fifteen for their annual buffalo hunt out on the Loup somewhere near where the city of Columbus now flourishes.</p>
                            <p>They had reached the hunting grounds and found the bison in great numbers, and were preparing for a grand onrush, when Little Wolf, one of the Omaha outriders, discovered a band of horsemen approaching from the north, on the opposite shore of the river.  Wah-tun-nun-she quickly recognized them as Sioux, and unwilling to retreat before a force no larger than his own, he drew his men upon their ponies in battle array on the south bank of the stream.  The Sioux halted when they were within 200 yards of the Omahas, and drew up in line, when Waucouta, who was at the head of the Sioux, and Wah-tun-nun-she rode forward to the river's bank to parley.  The Omaha chief felt that the result of a conflict on the open prairie between two such bands of indomitable warriors meant the extermination of one or the other, and though far from reluctant to engage in the struggle on account of himself, he did not like to sacrifice the men under him, as he had been dispatched on a hunting excursion and not upon the war trail.</p>
                            <p>The parley of the chieftains was of but brief duration.  Waucouta hurled derision and defiance at the Omaha when the latter endeavored to explain why he and his young men had entered the Sioux dominion, and returning a look of ferocious banter, he dug his heels into his pony's sides and galloped back to where his braves eagerly awaited him.</p>
                            <p>Throwing himself on the side of his horse Wah-tun-nun-she uttered the war cry of his nation, as he rode up and down before his men, interrupting without ceremony the war songs and solemn rites by which the younger among them were stimulating their spirits to deeds of daring.  When everything had been agreed upon, the Omahas galloped forward to the margin of the Loup, the Sioux advancing on the other side to meet them.</p>
                            <p>In a moment the hostile bands were separated only by the low ridges which lined each shore of the stream, the distance, however, being too great to admit of the use of either bow and arrows or spears, and only a few shots were fired by those possessing guns, and this was done more in bravado than with the expectation of doing execution.</p>
                            <p>Suddenly Waucouta shook his tassellated lance high in the air and uttered a single piercing yell in which the notes of exultation were blended with those of warning.  The wild signal was quickly answered by Wah-tun-nun-she, then followed the quick reports of the few guns in the parties and a flight of arrows, and the Indians dashed up to the river's <choice><sic>shore's</sic><corr>shores</corr></choice> on each side, where they began maneuvering, some on foot and some on horseback.  With a whoop the steed of the young Sioux chief was urged into the stream.  The challenge was too plain and taunting to be misconstrued and Wah-tun-nun-she plunged his horse in to meet him.  When within twenty yards of each other Waucouta fitted an arrow and drove it at his fearless foe.  The Omaha had barely time to raise his gun, and while it deflected the barb considerably, it struck him across his naked chest, leaving a ragged and ugly wound.  Then Wah-tun-nun-she's rifle spoke, and Waucouta was seen to throw himself from his horse into the river current.  The fiery little pony snorted with terror, throwing half his form out of the water in a desperate plunge.  The Sioux was badly wounded, and seeing that he was liable to reach the shore, where his men were riding up and down and firing their guns and arrows, as were the Omahas, on the opposite bank, in almost futile confusion, Wah-tun-nun-she leaped from his horse's back after him.  In a flash he was upon him, and grasped his flowing black locks in one hand, he raised his hunting knife aloft with the other.  The keen weapon described a glancing circle in the air, and was then plunged into the naked breast of the treacherous Sioux, the blade being buried to its buckhorn haft.</p>
                            <p>Waucouta's face blackened with the most hideous hatred and ferocity as he began to sink, but by sheer strength the Omaha held his form above the surface with one hand, while with the other he slashed him across the forehead and tore off his scalp, when he released the dead Sioux and dashed back upon the shore among his frenzied warriors.  He caught his pony, and throwing himself astride his back, again plunged into the stream, beckoning his men to follow him, and in another moment they were battling with Waucouta's band on the open prairie.</p>
                            <p>A series of wild and rapid evolutions with the ponies now began, and their charges and retreats, their wheelings and circuitous sweeps, were like the flight of so many startled hawks.  Amidst a medley of wild cries, arrows whizzed in all directions, blows were struck with the lance, the sand was scattered in the air, until finally the Sioux were compelled to retire, closely pressed by the Omahas.  Had the Sioux met their foes half way in the river's bed, with their superior numbers, the honors of the day would unquestionably have been theirs, notwithstanding the irretrievable loss they had sustained in the death of Wauouta.</p>
                            <p>That night Wah-tun-nun-she, feverish from the wound in his chest, gathered with the remnant of his gallant band, in a little motte of cottonwoods near where the station of Ocone stands today, and summed up the spoils and losses of the day.  Four of his young men were absent, but in their stead, at his own belt dangled three scalps, one of them being that of the truculent Waucouta, one of the fiercest and most dreaded warriors of the whole Sioux nation.  And that was not all.  Others among his little band gloated over one or more gory trophies, and while they mourned their own dead, they could not but believe that the day had been well won.</p>
                            <p>Such is the story of the last battle in Nebraska between the warriors of the Sioux and the Omahas, as told by Wah-tun-nun-she, the old chief now encamped with his tribe on the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ST. JOSEPH BANQUETED.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Wit, Wisdom and Humor Characterize Speeches at the Millard.</head>
                            <p>"It was a tremendous success," said Mayor P. J. Kirschner, speaking of the banquet given at the Millard yesterday afternoon, to the mayor, city council and officials of St. Joseph; "never saw anything like it."</p>
                            <p>Mayor Kirschner echoed the sentiment of the forty St. Joseph officials who partook of the elegant spread of Mayor Moores and the city officials of Omaha at the Millard yesterday afternoon.  Those present from St. Joseph were:</p>
                            <p>Dr. J. P. Kirschner, mayor; Rice D. Gilkey, treasurer; B. J. Casteel, city counsellor; Thomas R. Ashbrook, auditor; Dr. J. K. Graham, city physician; J. R. Radcliffe, city engineer; Abe Furst, street commissioner; George B. Allee, assessor; Robert Reed, sidewalk inspector; John Broder, chief of police; Pat Kane, chief of the fire department, and Aldermen John Bruce, president of the council; Phil Hall, W. H. Finch, F. C. Kuhl, G. V. Koch, John Kelley, Edward Chandlee, Richard Garvey, Sep Meyer, Henry Felling, Allen Twedell, M. P. Summers, Adoplh Schroder, Henry Brill, F. M. Kline, Charles Rupert.</p>
                            <p>Those present from Omaha were Mayor Frank E. Moores, W. J. Connell, city counsellor; A. G. Edwards, city treasurer; B. Higbee, city clerk; J. M. Westberg, comptroller; Fire Chief Redell; James Adams, private secretary to Mayor Moores; Councilmen W. T. Mount, Myron Carr, C. E. Lobeck and Ernst Stuht.</p>
                            <p>After and excellent dinner Mayor Moores, in his happiest vein, paid a compliment to St. Joseph, to her wealth, enterprise, push and energy, which was known the world over, called upon Mayor Kirschner for a speech.  "I didn't come here to speak," said Mayor Kirschner.  "I came here to see and to learn.  I am seeing and I am learning.  I shall go home a wiser man than I came.  I had heard much of Omaha and the exposition, but the half had not been told.  I am delighted."</p>
                            <p>Victor Koch, alderman, was the next speaker.  He had lived in Omaha, and knew Omaha to be a royal town, and expected a royal time, but the treatment was even beyond his highest expectations.  It was gorgeous.  He always admired the nerve, vim and push of Omaha.  Omaha was original and refreshing.  "We can only stay until Sunday night; wish we could stay a week."</p>
                            <p>John Broder, chief of police, was the next speaker.  He was happy and original.  He said he had lived forty years in St. Joseph, and had been out of town once before&#8212;to Kansas City.  Didn't think it possible a city the size and beauty of Omaha could be so close to St. Joseph.  He felt like annexing Omaha and making it a suburb of St. Joseph.  They were in the annexing business down there, having taken in some farms near by.</p>
                            <p>W. J. Connell city counsellor of Omaha, spoke, telling how near he came to locating in St. Joseph instead of Omaha when he left Vermont, years ago.  He admired St. Joseph, and if he ever left Omaha it would be to go to St. Joseph.</p>
                            <p>Benjamin J. Casteel, city counsellor of St. Joseph, made a ringing speech about the two greatest cities in the west, Omaha and St. Joseph.  Mr. Casteel is a pleasing speaker, and sustained his well earned reputation as a post-prandial orator.</p>
                            <p>Adolph Schroder of the Anheuser-Busch concern was called for.  Mayor Moores wanted a genuine German speech, and got it Mr. Schroder said he had a son who had been in American one week and he had enlisted in a St. Joseph company to fight Spain.  That was an evidence of his loyalty to the greatest country on earth.</p>
                            <p>George Allee said he came from Missouri and was proud of the old state.  He was not only a native of Missouri, but was born in Buchanan county.  Down there the picture of Bob Lee hung on one side of the hall in the homes and General Grant on the other; Jackson on one end and Sherman on the other; but Missouri was all right.  St. Joseph was all right; slightly democratic, but loyal to Old Glory and President McKinley.  He was humorous and practical.</p>
                            <p>Patrick Kane, chief of the fire department, was called for, and finding things getting real warm, moved that all drink water to the exposition, Omaha, St. Joseph and Mayor Moores, which was done standing.</p>
                            <p>The banquet adjourned at 4:30 that the partakers might get to the exposition to have a glance of the government display before 6 o'clock.  The three times three were hearty and earnest, and the close was emphasized with singing "America, 'Tis of Thee," all joining.</p>

                            <p>At a conference yesterday between President Wattles of the exposition and Senator Thurston it was decided that September 20 should be Government day at the exposition.  At that time the committee of fifteen from the senate will be present and all senators and representatives will be invited to participate.</p>
                            <p>Exercises will be held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock, when several addresses will be made and music furnished by the Mexican band and the exposition chorus.</p>
                            <p>Another thing that was definitely decided this morning was that of a week celebrating the return of peace.  The date will be October 9 to 16.</p>
                            <p>A strong committee will go to Washington and on September 3 formally invite President McKinley and his cabinet to be the guests of the exposition during that week.  On that committee will Senators Allen and Thurston and Congressman Mercer.</p>
                            <p>The details of the week have not been arranged, but there will be a repetition of the parade of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben,a water carnival on the lagoon and other big events.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>A good Sunday crowd was in attendance yesterday, although the rate was 50 cents.  It was a noticeable fact, however, that the great majority of the visitors were from out of town and that the St. Joseph badge was very much in evidence.  The excursionists from that city were there in force, practically all of the 3,000 having remained over, while a good sized party came in yesterday morning.  To have deducted that aggregation would have left barely a corporal's guard.</p>
                            <p>The greater part of the St. Joseph visitors left for home on late trains last evening that drew up to the north entrance to the grounds, giving them all of the time to spend on the grounds.  A large number will remain from one to three days longer, taking advantage of the extension of their tickets from two to five days.</p>
                            <p>The first thirteen days in August show an increase of 35,000 in attendance as compared with the first thirteen days in July.  This comparison includes the exceptionally large crowd of July 4, but for which the increase would be nearly double that number.  The last week saw an average paid attendance of over 8,000 on the grounds daily, with a free attendance averaging 4,850, making a total attendance for the week of 91,043.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AS TO THE PASSES.</head>
                            <p>The investigation of the pass situation conclusively disproves the allegations of wholesale <choice><sic>frouds</sic><corr>frauds</corr></choice>.  It is revealing instances of abuse, but it has been known from the start that there were bound to be some cases of this kind, and there will be in spite of all efforts to prevent it.  Some cases have been found where exhibitors and concessionaires have extended their lists of employes to a larger number than actually required.  In these cases the party securing the pass has paid the exposition $2.50 for it, covering the price of five admissions, so that it is a question whether the exposition is not ahead of where it would have been if the pass had not been issued.  These cases are all being checked up, and where the holder is not found to be actually employed as represented the pass is taken up.</p>
                            <p>As stated some days ago it was next to impossible to get a sick Indian to the hospital when the redskins first arrived here, but that is all changed now.  The ailing aborigines have had a taste of medical civilization, and they now promise to run the orientals a tight race in the demand for the attention of the doctors.  Both are like a lot of children in that respect, and they make the most trivial ailments an excuse for a visit to the hospital.  They have found out that the white medicine man is a good thing, and they are disposed to push him along to the full extent of their ability.</p>

                            <p>An oriental reported yesterday, claiming that there was something the matter with his arm, and making frightful contortions whenever he tried to raise it.  The doctor made an examination, and found that it was principally a case of imagination, so he proceeded to anoint the extended wing very liberally with chloroform.  The grimaces of the patient in the first place were as nothing compared with those that chased over his countenance as the fluid began to burn, but he insisted that it was a good thing, and went away satisfied.</p>
                            <p>A tall Indian giving the energetic name of Going-in-a-Hurry called at the drug emporium to take treatment for bug-in-the-ear.  The insect appeared to be having a whole lot of fun in the red man's cranium, but Dr. Campbell deftly extracted it with a corkscrew and pair of fire tongs and Going-in-a-Hurry went back to camp at peace with the entire world.</p>
                            <p>Another Indian bearing the cognomen of Petrified Buffalo was responsible for an ambulance call.  It was a case of cholera morbus, and Buffalo couldn't have had a more enthusiastic attack even if he hadn't been petrified.  He was taken to the hospital and filled to the muzzle with embalming fluid, and today you couldn't tell that there had ever been a thing the matter with him.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MEXICAN BAND GREETED.</head>
                            <p>The First Mexican Artillery band made its first appearance at the exposition grounds yesterday, rendering the afternoon concert in front of the Government building and the evening program at the band stand.  Large audiences greeted them at each performance and applauded in a most generous manner.  To institute comparisons would serve no good purpose, but it may be stated that the visitors to the exposition for the next six weeks will find nothing of which to complain in the musical feature.</p>
                            <p>The Mexican band promises to fully meet all expectations.  Several enthusiasts thought when the Marine band went home that the world had come to an end, and again with the closing of the Phinney band's engagement they about made up their minds that there was nothing left to live for, and in six weeks, when the Mexicans pack up their instruments, they will still think that the supply must be exhausted, but for the benefit of all such the pointer is given that the bureau of music has a whole box full of surprises still in store.</p>
                            <p>In honor of the visitors from the republic to the south, the Mexican flag was given a conspicuous place on the band stand alongside the banners of John Bull and Uncle Sam.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday was a quiet day in the Indian camp, the red inhabitants putting in their time smoking and sleeping.  Many visitors drifted up and down the paths and noted how religiously the Indian eschews work on the Sabbath day.  Captain Mercer is maturing plans for interesting programs of sport in addition to the sham battles that are to take place twice a week.</p>
                            <p>Major C. E. Llewellyn, commandant of the guard, went to Sioux City to spend the day, returning on the late evening train.</p>
                            <p>The Sunday beer question seems to have settled itself, and all of the dispensaries were doing business as usual, except that the amber was served in cups and saucers under the guise of "cold tea."</p>

                            <head type="sub">DOUGLAS COUNTY'S FRUIT.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Magnificent Display in the Horticultural Building.</head>
                            <p>Superintendent Walker deserves the highest compliment possible from the citizens of Douglas county for the excellent display of fruits that he is making in his department at the Horticultural hall.</p>
                            <p>While Douglas county farmers and fruit growers produce the fruits and make it possible for a display to be carried on, it devolves upon Superintendent Walker to hustle over the county and secure the exhibit.  The fruits are mainly bought from the growers; occasionally some specimens are donated for display.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Walker has now on his tables of the 1897 crop of apples plates of the Romanite, Lansingburg, Willow-twig, Limber-twig, Ben Davis, Wine Sap, Jonathan, Eickie and Jennette.  These samples are all in fine condition, perfect in form, free from specks, decay or objectionable features.  The wonder and astonishment of visitors is how these apples keep up under the influences of heat and summer conditions, which naturally are supposed to influence quick decay with cold storage fruits.</p>
                            <p>Walker says "it is because they are the produce of Nebraska soil and are tempered by the wonderful preserving influences of Nebraska climate."  His explanation is usually satisfactory.</p>
                            <p>In new apples, apples of the 1898 crop, he has on his tables the Astrichan, Early Harvest, Early Pennock, Yellow Transparent, Sops of Wine, Maidens Blush, Iowa Blush and Wealthy.  The new varieties, while good, are not so free from blemishes.  The apples of this year's crop are difficult to get clear of insect blemish.</p>
                            <p>In crabs Douglas county is now showing twenty-one varieties and all of these are good specimens.  The crabs are a fine exhibition of fruit, but in utility are confined to the preserve and pickling uses.</p>
                            <p>The peach display that Douglas county is putting up is possibly the greatest surprise in its excellence and qualities of any line of fruit shown.  The varieties now on exhibit are:  Alberta, Early Crawford, Early Rivers and Bokara.  A number of other varieties are in sight for next week and the peach display promises to grow much larger toward the first of September.</p>
                            <p>Peach growing, Mr. Walker says, is rapidly increasing in Douglas county, and in localities along the Missouri river bluffs will certainly make a great success, with proper care and attention.  One thing very noticeable in this peach display is the size of the fruit.  One downy sphere measures eight inches in circumference and it was not believed to be larger than many others on the tables.  The quality, in solidity of flesh, flavor, etc., is a remarkable feature with the Douglas county peaches.</p>
                            <p>Grapes are coming in in a very encouraging display.  Champion, Moores Early, Worden, Telegraph and Early Hartford represent the varieties now being shown.  They are all fine large clusters, very solid and free from defects.  The grape display in Douglas county will be a leading feature in thirty days.</p>
                            <p>The plum king, Theodore Williams of Benson, saw in a recent newspaper report that Douglas county had eight varieties of plums on exhibition, that they were fine specimens, etc.  This was too much for the plum expert to stand and not show his colors.  Saturday morning he gathered 108 varieties from his orchard, that were in nice show trim and brought them down to the exposition for Mr. Walker.  He said he thought if he went the other fellows 100 better that it would be satisfactory for this time, but when it comes to a contest that he could go right on up into the hundreds without any trouble.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Williams did not name fifty-eight of this 108 varieties of plums, saying:  "These are of my own origin and I don't care to give names for them in this exhibition, as there is no competition."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Williams also furnished eighteen of the twenty-one varieties of crabs now on exhibition.</p>
                            <p>Douglas county is in the fruit display in a most creditable form and expects to keep it up to the close.</p>

                            <head type="sub">American Association to Hold Its Meeting in September.</head>
                            <p>The American Forestry association will hold an important meeting in Omaha Friday and Saturday, September 9 and 10.  This meeting is held in accordance with a vote of the association at its meeting at Nashville a year ago, and it was contemplated at that time that this meeting should be largely devoted to topics relating to the west.  It has also been arranged that a number of western men of many years' experience in the west shall be placed upon the program, so that the "Great Treeless District" may have thorough representation.</p>
                            <p>Some of the well-known persons who will take part in the meeting by presenting papers are: Hon. J. Sterling Morton, Dr. George L. Miller, Hon. R. W. Furnas, E. F. Stephens, C. A. Keffer, C. L. Watrous, F. S. Phoenix, Henry Michelsen, S. M. Emery, George Van Houten, C. S. Harrison, Prof. Charles E. Bessey, B. E. Fernew, Prof. Lawrence Bruner and George E. Kesser.</p>
                            <p>The exact topic assigned to each speaker will be announced a little later, but, in the meantime, it may be understood that it is proposed to have a thoroughly profitable program, made up from the topics which will have the most interest to those who are likely to be in attendance.  The low rate on the railroads at this time will make it possible for many to attend this meeting who could, perhaps, not otherwise come.  The exact place of meeting in Omaha will be announced in due season.</p>
                            <p>Persons interested or desirous of any further information are cordially invited to correspond with F. W. Taylor, superintendent of agriculture and horticulture, Trans-Mississippi exposition, Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The officers of the association are Hon. Francis H. Appleton, president, Boston, and George P. Whittlesey, recording secretary and treasurer, Washington.</p>

                            <p>The ninth annual meeting of the Nebraska Photographers' association convenes in Thurston Rifles' hall Tuesday.  The hall will present a beautiful appearance.  Artists from many of the leading cities of the country will have pictures on exhibition.  Many of the noted photographers of Washington, New York, Buffalo, Chicago and other cities are now in the city, and others will come.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the state association will be the Trans-Mississippi association meeting.  Medals will be contested for by artists.  During the four days there will be lunches, lectures on different phases of the art, drives, trolley rides, receptions and business sessions.  A reception will be given at George W. Lininger's one evening.  The business sessions will be held in the forenoons, and the afternoons will be given up to demonstrations at the hall and a grand time generally.  H. Lancaster of Omaha is president of both associations.</p>

                            <p>The following program has been decided upon for the carrying out of the fruit festival idea in connection with the exposition:</p>
                            <p>September 2, peach day.</p>
                            <p>September 9, melon day.</p>
                            <p>September 16, grape day.</p>
                            <p>October 21, apple day.</p>
                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi Fruit Festival association, comprising representatives from many of the leading fruit states, is organized to take these special day features and contribute fruits to make the occasion a great feast, free to all exposition visitors.</p>
                            <p>The effort of the association will be to give these special days publicity and secure as much co-operation as possible from all states and districts of states engaged in the production of these fruits given a place on the program.  Peach day comes first, and is placed at a date which accommodates nearly every peach-growing locality in the west.</p>
                            <p>The grand display of fireworks Saturday night in honor of St. Joseph day was witnessed by several thousand people, who showed their appreciation by enthusiastic applause.  John Due of the A. L. Due company is a young man of wonderful ability and he conceives some most magnificent designs.</p>
                            <p>The display Saturday night began with a grand illumination of the lake in the midst of which was a large set piece, "Welcome St. Joe."  The aerial effects were very gorgeous, and the set pieces were more attractive than usual.  Among the pieces were:  A peacock, with spreading tail; McKinley diamond, man riding a bicycle on wire cable 300 feet long, portrait of Mayor P. J. Kirchner of St. Joseph.

                            <p>Lincoln, Neb., Aug. 11.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: I am informed that the exhibition of only one side of Indian life, and that a side that is rapidly passing away, at the Trans-Mississippi exposition, is causing a good deal of protest among the missionaries and others who have given their lives to the work of civilization and Christianity among the various tribes in the United States.  It is reported to me that all workers among the Indians have everywhere used all their influence to prevent Indians from coming to the exposition and engaging in the barbarous customs that they have so long tried to stop on the reservations.  In consequence of this opposition the officers in charge of the collecting and bringing the Indians to Omaha have only been able to induce those Indians to come who have always opposed the schools, the missionaries and the employes of the government who have been endeavoring to induce the Indians to adopt the customs of civilization.</p>
                            <p>Among the Indian tribes there are educated physicians, lawyers, ministers, teachers, orators, writers, artists, skilled mechanics and men and women eminent in every walk of life.  All this class of Indians&#8212;and their numbers would astonish even the well posted citizen&#8212;are putting up vigorous protests against this one-sided exhibition of their race at Omaha.  They all feel very deeply the disgrace of it.  They claim, and it seems to me justly, that this one-sided exhibition is a detriment to them individually and to the race as a whole.  It is engendering a bitterness among them and among the unselfish Christian workers among the Indians on all the reservations that will not subside for years to come.</p>
                            <p>What the educated Indians demand, and it seems to me a just demand, is that a day should be set aside for them.  Let them show the advancement that has been made in the arts and sciences since the city of Omaha was founded.  They feel that it is something to be proud of.  Let the exposition management give a day to the educated and cultured Indians.  If the government will give to them free transportation in the same way it has given it to the Indians who have refused every effort made by the government to educate and civilize them more than 1,000 Indian lawyers, physicians, ministers, teachers, artists, writers, musicians, skilled mechanics and successful farmers will assemble and the exhibition of the products of their industries would of itself fill a building.  Let there be a day for the educated Indian.  Besides the thousand that are qualified to appear upon the rostrum and entertain a cultivated audience with addresses or papers of the greatest interest there are enough more to fill the Auditorium of well-dressed, moderately prosperous Indian men and women (not bucks and squaws), who would be glad to come if the government would extend to them the same courtesies that it so lavishly grants to those who have opposed every effort of the government to civilize them.</p>

Such a celebration could easily be made the crowning glory of the exposition.  The glorious won&#8212;victories for humanity and justice, and victories that also demonstrate the prowess of American arms&#8212;have made all the people rejoice, and with one accord they would gather at some central place to celebrate these victories while celebrating the return of peace.</p>
                            <p>"Peace Day" at the exposition!  That's a name to conjure with.  By all means let the exposition directory take up the matter at once and be ready to set a date as soon as peace is formally declared.  Let it be heralded broadcast over the country, and the greatest day in the history of the exposition will be the result.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">A PEACE JUBILEE.</hi></head>
                            <p>The triumphant close of the war inspires every true patriotic American citizen with thanksgiving over the restoration of peace.  The occasion, however, calls for more than mere expressions of rejoicing.  It is worthy of a peace demonstration, the like of which the country has never seen before.</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Exposition, itself a monumental triumph of peace, illustrating the material development and industrial advancement of the greater west, should be the center of the nation's great peace jubilee.  Carried to completion in the face of the menacing war cloud and having successfully run the gauntlet of the discouraging distractions of the conflict with Spain, the exposition affords the most appropriate background for the exultation of American patriotism.</p>
                            <p>Numerous reasons combine to urge that the jubilee be held in connection with the exposition.  Omaha is the most central point on the continent, midway between the Atlantic and the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico and the Canadian border.  The city enjoys unrivaled railroad facilities, making it readily accessible from all directions.  Omaha is the headquarters of one of the great military departments and the seat of two army posts, where the returning soldiers who participate in the jubilee may be comfortably housed and provided for.  Chicago, which has been contemplating a peace demonstration, has abandoned the project, while Omaha has the resources, the energy and the incentive to make it an unexampled success.</p>
                            <p>It is gratifying that in the preliminary steps already taken by the exposition management the magnitude and importance of the event appear to be fully realized.  The peace jubilee to be complete should have as its central figure the president who has so wisely and skillfully guided the nation through war to peace.  With President McKinley and his cabinet and the higher officers of the national government in attendance, surrounded by the governors of all the great states of the union accompanied by their staffs, reviewing such corps of the victorious army as had been withdrawn from active service at the seat of war, the significant lesson of peace would make an everlasting impression upon the people of the whole country.  By the second week of October, the time selected for the celebration, the final draft of the treaty which is to restore friendly relations between the two nations lately at war will have been signed, and the jubilee will be not only the crowning glory of the fight for humanity but also the culminating feature of the marvelous Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

                            <p>The record of increasing exposition attendance continues.  Although the seven days just past did not involve any feature that compared in general interest with the Flower day and Indian day celebrations of the preceding week, the aggregate attendance was fully as great.  There was a very light Sunday attendance, but during the succeeding days the crowd increased by regular stages until Thursday, when the maximum attendance of the week was reached.  There was a slight falling off on the last two days owing to the fact that large numbers of strangers who had spent the first part of the week on the grounds left in order to get home before Sunday.  The aggregate attendance during the week was 90,000, distributed as follows: Sunday, 7,312; Monday, 10,204; Tuesday, 12,608; Wednesday, 15,399; Thursday, 17,750; Friday, 13,770; Saturday (estimated), 13,000.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday the people of St. Joseph made good their assurance that they would contribute the biggest municipal celebration that has yet been held on the grounds.  They came nearly 3,000 strong and bestowed their most enthusiastic approval on every feature of the big show.  Most of them will remain over Sunday and see the rest of it.</p>
                            <p>As the trains on which the St. Joe delegation traveled did not reach Omaha until nearly noon, they were not largely in evidence on the grounds until the latter part of the day.  But they made up for lost time by parading through the grounds in tallyho coaches and accompanied by Pryor's band in the evening they made things lively on the Midway.  They were delighted with their reception and the show and most of them expressed the intention of coming again later in the season.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Practical Result of Experimental Farming and Plant Feeding.</head>
                            <p>One of the most interesting exhibits at the exposition is that of the North Carolina State Horticultural society.  This exhibit is situated in the Agricultural building.  It seems that under the auspices of the North Carolina State Horticultural society, acting in co-operation with the state experiment station, an "experimental farm" was established about three years ago at Southern Pines, N. C.  The managers of the farm are constantly engaged in scientifically experimenting to find out what kinds and amounts of fertilizing materials will produce the largest crops at the least expense.</p>
                            <p>The three principal elements of plant food, that is, potash, phosphate and nitrogen, are mixed in varying amounts or proportions, the object being to find, by comparing the growth and yields of the plants experimented upon, just how much of each particular ingredient should be used in order to get the best results from the different crops.  The farm is divided into "experimental plots," each being one-tenth of an acre in size, and twenty experiments with each crop are made with different combinations of potash, acid phosphate and nitrogen.  Some of the results obtained at the farm are shown in the Omaha exhibit.  In the exhibit the pictures which one sees hung around the room are designed to illustrate at a glance the value of the right kind of plant food when applied to farm crops.</p>
                            <p>Several of the pictures illustrate experiments with tobacco at the experimental farm.  One picture shows the yield on plot No. 13, which was not fertilized.  The yield was just 220 pounds.  Another shows the yield on plot No. 14, which was moderately fertilized; the yield was 1,140 pounds.  Then again there is a picture showing the yield from plot No. 19.  Here the crop was fertilized at the rate of 30 pounds of muriate of potash, 700 pounds of acid phosphate and 500 pounds of nitrate of soda per acre.  The yield was 1,620 pounds of tobacco.  Large amounts of fertilizer were used on plot 20, but the yield was about the same as on plot 19, thus showing that excessive fertilization does not pay.</p>
                            <p>This series of pictures of the various experiments brings out the important fact that the difference between no fertilizer and proper fertilization is about 1,400 pounds in the case of tobacco.  Practically as great differences can be shown with other crops.  In other words, the proper application of the three principal elements, namely, potash, phosphoric acid and nitrogen, is <choice><sic>indispesable</sic><corr>indispensable</corr></choice> in profitable farming and the most successful farmers are those who know how to fertilize to as to raise the best and largest crops.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MEXICAN BAND FINALLY ON HAND.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Musicians of the Seventh Artillery to Furnish Music Here Six Weeks.</head>
                            <p>The band of the Seventh regiment of Mexican artillery has arrived for a six weeks' stay at the exposition.  The organization reached the city yesterday forenoon, forty-two men strong and was escorted to the exposition grounds.  Passes were supplied and then the men went out to hunt boarding places.</p>
                            <p>The band is in charge of M. Venta, with Ricardo Pacheco as leader, and is recognized as the crack musical organization of the republic.  All of the members are enlisted men and make music and musical matters a business.  They left the City of Mexico last Sunday night and were on the road constantly until their arrival in Omaha.  Notwithstanding this fact and their fatigued condition, immediately after going to their rooms and washing up and eating, they were called out for three hours of practice.  Practice, Leader Pacheco says, is what makes the Mexican army bands perfect.  No matter how much work band men may have performed and no matter what may be the occasion or the condition of the weather, they are required to practice three hours each day, the year round.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday the band practiced in an old barn on the south side of the exposition grounds and after a few notes had been played, a crowd gathered about the doors.  After the practice had been finished, it was the universal opinion that it is the best band that has visited the city since the opening of the exposition.  All of the selections played yesterday afternoon were by American authors and were frequently applauded.</p>
                            <p>Musical Director Kelly, who listened to the music, said:  "I consider it as fine as I have ever heard.  I will not except even Sousa.  The exposition has made a great hit in securing this band for the six weeks' run and its being here ought to draw a great crowd daily.  I heard the Mexican band in Chicago during the World's fair and consider this organization far superior to the one that was there."</p>
                            <p>The members of the band were clad in the regulation fatigue uniform, consisting of a heavy leather artillery cap, black blouse with yellow chevrons on the sleeves and black trousers with red stripes down the outer seams.  The dress uniform which will be worn at concerts is much more showy.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exposition Managers Begin Arrangement of the Formalities.</head>
                            <p>Since the conclusion of peace is assured the exposition management has begun active preparation for the grand Peace jubilee which will celebrate the event.  It was determined some time ago that if peace was declared before the exposition closed it would be made the subject of a great celebration, and immediately on the announcement that the protocol had been signed at Washington, President Wattles and Manager Rosewater took the matter actively in hand.  At a conference this morning with Senator Thurston it was decided that the jubilee should be held during the week of October 9 to 15.  This will afford ample time for preparation, and the week will be made the premier period of the exposition.  On September 3 a committee, consisting of Senators Thurston and Allen, Congressman Mercer, and at least three members of the exposition directory will call on President McKinley to secure his consent to be present, with the members of his cabinet, and participate in the celebration.  Letters have also been addressed to the governors of all the transmississippi states and territories asking them to join <unclear reason="torn"/> invitation to President McKinley, and <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">Sister Republic on the South Puts Out a Very Nice Display.</head>
                            <p>The installation of the Mexican exhibit in the International hall has just been completed and the display adds a very interesting feature to the attractions of the building.  While the industries of the country are not so fully represented as was contemplated when the matter was first taken up with the Mexican government, the exhibit fills a large space, occupying one entire corner of the building and affords a variety of interesting information in regard to the conditions that exist in the territory of our southern neighbor.  It is in charge of Albino R. Nuncio, who has represented the Mexican government at previous expositions and who is thoroughly familiar with the resources and prospects of the country.</p>
                            <p>A large proportion of the exhibit is devoted to a partial display of the agricultural resources of Mexico, which are rapidly growing in importance.  Ten varieties of coffee are exhibited, as well as samples of the coffee bean in its various stages of preparation for the market.  There are jars of wheat, showing the difference between the product of the warmer zone and that of the north, and numerous samples of corn, rice and other samples.  There is an especially extensive showing of beans which include twenty varieties in addition to the castor bean, from which castor oil is pressed.</p>
                            <p>The growth of the cotton industry in Mexico is also made a prominent feature.  Five years ago the product was being imported, but now it is being exported in large quantities every year.  The climate is such that two crops can be raised every year and it is becoming one of the most lucrative products for the farmer.  The tobacco industry is represented by an extensive display of cigars and cigarettes of various grades in addition to samples of the leaf.  The tobacco is decidedly darker than the American product and its rich but somewhat rank flavor is familiar to most smokers.</p>
                            <p>Feminine visitors to the building are attracted by the display of silk and of drawn work and embroidery.  A quantity of very pretty silk shawls and ribbons are exhibited and the drawn work contributed by the Mexican women includes a number of very original designs that are worked out with wonderful patience.</p>
                            <p>Several of the cases are occupied by a collection of mineral specimens furnished by the Geological institute at Mexico.  These include a variety of formations of gold, silver, lead, copper and zinc, many of which represent very valuable deposits.  The display of Mexican onyx is particularly beautiful.  It includes various grades and colors from the pure white to variegated patterns, all of which take a high polish and compare favorably with the finest specimens that are exhibited elsewhere on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>A large collection of statues and still life groups modeled in cloth represent the decorative genius of the Mexican Indians and these are pretty enough to be classed as works of art.  A huge saddle with spurs, riata and other accessories is a remarkably handsome specimen of embossed work on leather and is valued at several hundred dollars.  There is also a large display of carpets manufactured from jute and a collection of public and private records illustrate the methods of keeping these records that prevail.</p>

His private car came in from St. Louis over the Missouri Pacific and was switched to the exposition tracks on the north side of the grounds.  After breakfast General Manager Yokum went upon the grounds and spent the greater portion of the day in the buildings.  Speaking of the exposition he said:  "It is grand and is superior to the expositions formerly held.  The buildings are beautiful and they are so nicely arranged.  The buildings, however, are but a small portion of the exposition.  The exhibits are the things that tell the tale of the wealth of the country.  They are magnificent and the showing that is being made ought to convince the people who come here that the transmississippi region is the bone and sinew of this great republic."</p>

                            <p>At a conference yesterday between Senator Thurston and President Wattles of the exposition arrangements for the celebration of Government day, September 20, were largely completed.  The invitation to congress to participate in the event reached the house of representatives too late for formal action, but the senate has appointed a committee of fifteen, of which Senator Thurston is chairman, to represent it at the exposition.  The members of that committee will all be here on Government day, as well as a large number of congressmen and other government officials.  The main program of the day will be held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock.  President Wattles will deliver an address in behalf of the exposition and a number of senators, to be hereinafter selected by Senator Thurston, will respond.  An especially elaborate musical program will be rendered by the Mexican band and the exposition chorus.  Immediately following the exercises the distinguished guests will be tendered a banquet at the Casino at which the senators who did not speak in the morning will respond to toasts.  There will be an exceptionally brilliant fireworks display in the evening.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday was housecleaning day with the Indians in camp upon the north tract and getting out of their tepees an hour earlier than usual they put in the early morning hours slicking up and putting everything in a presentable shape.  The occasion for doing this extra work was due to the fact that word had been passed along the line that Senator Thurston would visit the village during the afternoon.</p>
                            <p>During the afternoon Senator Thurston spent a few hours in the Indian camp and seemed pleased with the situation.  He met a number of the leading men of the different tribes and extended a cordial greeting to all.</p>
                            <p>An addition to the Indian village is expected within the next few days.  Captain Mercer has received word from the Crow agency in Montana to the effect that a party of Crow Indians have started for the exposition, and that they are due to arrive almost any day.  How many there are in the party he does not know.  Originally it was expected that there would be twenty.</p>
                            <p>Today the Indians will rest and those who are not of a religious turn of mind will spend the day loafing around the camp.  A number of Indians will attend services in the morning at Trinity cathedral, a special invitation having been sent to them by Dean Fair.</p>

Wilkins will sing the solo.  It had been intended to have a quartet choir for the occasion, but this arrangement has fallen through.</p>
                            <p>The initial concerts by the Mexican band of forty-two pieces will be a sufficient attraction to interest the visitors during the remainder of the day.  The band will play in front of the Government building at 2 o'clock and on the Plaza at 7 o'clock in the evening.  Everyone who heard its rehearsal yesterday afternoon is delighted with its music, and it is believed that its concerts will be one of the most popular features of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The exposition grounds were crowded with visitors last night, a great portion of them being out of town people, of which the St. Joseph contingent was the most numerous.  Everything on the Midway did a good business and most of the attractions had all they could handle.</p>
                            <p>The display of fireworks managed by Prof. Cummins was about the best that has been seen since the opening of the exposition.  The St. Joseph people attended in a body and occupied a section of seats set apart for them.  They were in charge of Mayor Moores and the members of the city council.  There was a fine picture of Mayor P. J. Kirschener, and, as it lighted up with candles and rockets, it was received with cheers.  In addition to this there was the bombardment of Manila, a set piece upon the lake.  There were the usual number of rockets and bombs, the display ending with "Good Night" in colored fire.</p>

                            <p>The Mixed Congress of Colored and White Americans, which is to be held on August 17, 18 and 19, promises to be one of the successful exposition conventions.  On August 17 at 10 o'clock exercises will be held at the exposition and the meetings on the other day will be downtown, probably at Creighton hall.  The program for August 17 has not been entirely arranged, but the chief features, as far as are known at present, will be as follows:  Address of welcome on behalf of the state, Lieutenant Governor Harris; address of welcome on behalf of Omaha, Mayor Moores; response to the welcome, Judge C. Augustus Straker of Detroit, Mich.; singing of "America," "Star Spangled Banner," "Red, White and Blue" and "Hail Columbia" by a chorus of forty voices, under the leadership of Cyrus D. Bell; singing of "The Boys Who Wore the Blue Are Turning Gray" by a male quartet.</p>

                            <p>Phinney's band gave its final concert last night, playing on the Plaza, where an immense crowd congregated.  During the evening Mrs. F. H. Cole sent in fifty bouquets, which were distributed among the band boys.  Since coming to the exposition, Phinney's band has given between eighty and ninety concerts on the Plaza, in the Auditorium and on the lagoon.  At the end of the concert last night there were loud calls for Prof. Phinney, and in responding he assured the audience that he and his people left Omaha with many regrets.  He said that his stay of six weeks had been very enjoyable, and that after leaving for Chicago he would be a standing advertisement for Omaha and the exposition.  The band leaves for the east this morning.  Prof. and Mrs. Phinney will go tonight.</p>

They were escorted about the grounds by Colonel Richardson of the press committee and were enthusiastic over the situation.  They expressed surprise at the magnitude of the exposition, and said that the buildings and exhibits are much better than they expected to find them.</p>

                            <p>Pryor's famous military band of St. Joseph, Mo., will play all of Sunday afternoon at the East Midway Casino.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed of the department of concessions left yesterday for North Scituate, Mass., where his family has been spending the summer.  They will return in about ten days.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Chase of the Iowa state commission has returned to his home at Cedar Rapids, where he will remain ten days or two weeks.  During his absence the building will be in charge of ex-Governor Packard.</p>
                            <p>The daily exhibitions of the United States Life Saving crew under Captain Knowles continue to interest immense crowds at 4 o'clock.  Visitors who have seen the performances of the service on their stations say that the drill put up by this crew is a very superior article and to those who have never seen anything of the kind it is one of the most fascinating features on the grounds.</p>

                            <p>It was the intention to commence judging the flowers on the Bluff tract yesterday, but owing to the fact that some of the exhibitors were late in getting their exhibits in, especially the sweet peas, the awarding of prizes was postponed.</p>
                            <p>The hospital wagon answered some thirty calls yesterday and all of the wards in the building were full during a greater portion of the day.  None of the cases taken in were serious, most of them being headache and minor afflictions.  Children were largely in evidence.</p>
                            <p>The expert employed by the special committee on investigation to audit the accounts of the various departments, arrived from Minneapolis and will begin work Monday.  He was ready to go to work yesterday morning, but as the committee had neglected to provide him with written credentials he was unable to obtain access to the books.</p>
                            <p>The Sons of Veteran's drum corps of Denver has been engaged to play at the exposition during the week beginning September 11.  The corps includes twenty-seven men and is said to be the best organization of the kind in the west.  The national encampment of the Sons of Veterans occurs in Omaha during the same week and the drum corps was considered a very appropriate attraction at that time.  The members make no charge for their services except for their expenses while they are in the city.</p>
                            <p>Hon. N. Roudebeck, commissioner from Everett, Wash., is now at the exposition in charge of the space set aside for the Washington mineral exhibit.  Mr. L. K. Armstrong, superintendent of the mineral exhibit from Washington, arrives today with two carloads of the finest specimens of ore, which will all be in position within a week's time.  D. B. Ward, who has been at the exposition conducting an advertising bureau for Seattle, has been recalled and left for home Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>General Manager Clarkson calls attention to the fact that the wheelmen who have acquired the idea that they were to be admitted to the grounds free on Monday, will be disappointed.  No such arrangement has been authorized or proposed.  The same rule will apply that has been in force at previous parades, and that is to the effect that the bands and floats will be admitted free, but individuals must buy tickets like anyone else.  In the present case a number of floats that have been constructed on several bicycles will be admitted, but the decoration of a single wheel does not constitute a float.</p>

                            <l>(Copyrighted, 1898, by the Author.)</l>
                            <p>If anything the farmers of Nebraska are more thriving than the townspeople.  They have a splendidly fertile soil and a climate "Just made for corn;" and they are of the genuine Anglo-Saxon stock, which will not take a fall from Nature or anything else.  On the small section of the state where the sun is too kind, and the rainfall sometimes fails, they have turned disaster into success by means of alfalfa and irrigation.  As a rule, the Nebraska farmer is a man who has been making money.  One good year here will put a man out of debt, two will give him a better house and a balance at his banker's.  The Nebraska farmers are coming to the exposition in numbers.  One would say that, by the first of November, there would be difficulty in finding the man who had not gone, either in person or through some proxy from his family, to see the great show.  Iowa and Kansas are sending an army also, and thousands come from Illinois.  The management has prepared a crowded program.  During June there was a procession of state days, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, in a single week.  Bands and processions, quiet and weary and dusty governors and gorgeous young staff officers in gold cord and plumed hats, singers and songs, speakers and speeches filled the Auditorium and the <choice><sic>expostiion</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice> streets.  President Wattles said something pretty to each state; something different, also, and proved that, besides Chauncey Depew, there are others.</p>
                            <p>The quiet governors made their speeches in turn, and then stood for hours shaking hands with ardent and perspiring fellow-citizens and their wives.  The state building had flowers everywhere, and the busy commissioners went about with an absentminded smile and shook hands until they wondered whether it could be so much worse <unclear reason="covered"/> president.  It was all tiring; the sun <unclear reason="covered"/> yet, there was something in the <unclear reason="covered"/>s good nature of these warm, fatigued, yet eager crowds that was homely and heartsome.  It was plain that they enjoyed themselves.  They bought candy and peanuts and hot beef sandwiches; they chafed Aunt Jemima as she made pancakes and asked her if she was the real Aunt Jemima of the advertisements, to which she always returned the same placid, "Laws, yes, honey; have a cake?"  They drank the free ice water in such appalling quantities that one wondered they did not drop dead on the ground, they walked countless miles through the buildings, hardly glancing at the white-coated chair bearers, parleying with the jinricksha men, but not spending money on them.  They took in the Midway from the explosion of the Maine to the Cuban wonder and the wild west; they rested a space on the green settees or rode in the gondolas, watching for the fireworks; at last, sighing, but not from weariness, they turned their farewell glances on the radiant court, the fountains spouting sapphires and rubies and the fire-limned palaces and climbing into the cars.</p>
                            <p>"Coming back?" cried one tall, sunburned fellow, whose linen coat was dazzling with patriotic souvenirs of the exposition, silk specimens, a gaudy puzzle bestowed by Aunt Jemima, and the broad ribbon badge of his state, "coming back?  Well, I guess!  I'm going to fetch all the folks, from my old mother to the baby.  Say, it's great!"</p>
                            <p>There was a musical congress, very successful, both as to music and attendance.  There was a Turner's day, with an athletic exhibition, wildly applauded, and an eloquent oration.  And several thousand people now know something of the valiant fight and the sacrifices that the turners made for liberty, thanks to the orator of that occasion.  And it is safe to say that of these thousands fully half had previously associated the turners only with lager beer, white tights, parallel bars and human pyramids&#8212;which is one of the illustrations of the education of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Appearance of the State Buildings.</head>
                            <p>The state buildings are the exposition club houses.  They are scattered about the Bluff tract, back of the great Horticulture building.  Besides its ornate architecture, its great glass dome and crowd of minarets, its frieze of cupids playing amid fruit and flowers, and its lovely groups of Night and Morning, the state buildings take on an air of simplicity.  The less adorned are almost plain.  The immense Nebraska building, however, will compare with the structures on the Main Court; Illinois has a stately home, in admirably good taste; Iowa's building is one of the most graceful, having an original and amazingly comfortable arrangement of piazzas.  It is like a fine old colonial country house, and within the hall has a pipe organ, an exquisite cameo collection, and some really good bits of painting, representing Iowa scenes.</p>
                            <p>There is a very large, beautifully-built log cabin amid the more pretentious structures.  And the towering yellow wigwam attracts every eye.  It may be heretical, but I confess to finding the state buildings distinctly more pleasing than those of the World's fair.  They are as a rule in better harmony with the general design, and they are more picturesque and better disposed as features of the landscape.</p>
                            <p>The landscape gardening is one very striking example of western quickness to learn.  The gardeners have studied their lesson at the great fair to good purpose.  They have learned not only when to ornament, but (a rarer gift of fortune in a gardener), when to let the kindly scene alone.  In consequence there is a happy diversity of effect, and the jaded eye is soothed at intervals by beautiful spaces and masses of greenery.  There is plenty of the intricate play of colors, plenty of variety in the designs and the floral bas reliefs which gardeners affect.  An ingenious one is the great horn of plenty, framed from coulises in front of the Iowa building, pouring out its wealth of brilliant colors on the terrace.</p>

                            <head type="sub">On the Midway.</head>
                            <p>The Midway at Omaha has a general resemblance to the Midway we all know.  It glitters with flaming and flaring lights and the gayest of colors; it resounds day and night with the blaring of horns and the pounding of drums and cymbals, and the banging of pistols by the Wild West riders.  It has all kinds of bizarre architecture, from an Indian tepee to a Moorish palace.  It is crowded and dusty and noisy and full of heat and screaming gaiety, but it isn't so dusty as one might expect, and the exposition police have kept it clean on the outside.</p>
                            <p>There is a feature of its own in the gigantic See-Saw.  No one should neglect it any more than the Ferris wheel at the Chicago Midway.  It is unique, so are the visitor's sensations.  "You can see for nothing, but it costs you 25 cents to saw!"</p>
                            <p>I spent a half hour in what the man outside described as the "most elegant and high-class show on the grounds," the Moorish palace.  I saw Marie Antoinette going to execution, a captive tortured at the stake, a young man who had been having a night of it, and some happy families, and some nymphs in bosky dells with rocks and trees, and a tremendous amount of other waxen horror and loveliness&#8212;all for 25 cents.</p>
                            <p>Over opposite a man with a noble voice and the perspiration streaming down his face was giving apparently a little moral lecture.  Beside him stood a lean young man, whose skin was pallid and his eyes pink-rimmed.  He looked both limp and anemic.  His line in life was to swallow swords.  "This young man is going to swallow that sword in a minnit, ladies and gentlemen," boomed the touter, "jest you wait; come up, come up, no charge&#8212;we do these things to show what kind of an exhibition we keep.  After he has swallowed the sword&#8212;pass it round, feel the edge if you like, all solid steel&#8212;after the young man has swallowed the sword I'm going to fetch out one of our ladies.  This little lady I'm going to show you is from Paris, France, and she and the other ladies dance.  Dance.  And the ladies that are conducting this exposition, they sent a committee over here.  Why did they done it?  They done it to be sure we was conducting a refined and elegant exhibition which couldn't shock nobody.  And they put a card in the paper to that effect.  If you wish to see one of the most beautiful strictly first-class shows on the ground or anywhere walk in.  Now, young man."  The part of the refined and elegant show present proceeded to swallow the sword.  I don't know how he did it, and it was rather awful to witness, but apparently he did swallow it up to the hilt.  I am also told that the dancing is not unpleasant and very well done.</p>

                            <p>Of course there is a Street of Cairo and some sad-eyed camels, and there is a Street of All Nations which troops out on camels and horses and makes a mighty din.  There is a very good cyclorama and a most life-like Southern plantation, which has song and dance and is good enough to be visited more than once, and there is an explosion of the Maine which, <choice><sic>considerbly</sic><corr>considerably</corr></choice> to my surprise, I found one of the very prettiest little things on the grounds.  The scene, the ships riding at anchor in Havana harbor ("on real water, ladies and gentlemen"); the tropical storm, the illumination of the city and the sunrise are remarkably pretty.  As for the explosion it wouldn't disturb a rabbit.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">The Indian Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>The most picturesque feature of the exposition has just been established and begun its working.  This is the Indian Congress.  It will last during the exposition.  The United States has appropriated $40,000 and an effort is to be made to show the daily existence, the customs, the industries (so far as they have industries and the extent of these is greater than is suspected), the amusements of a vanishing race.  There has never been any undertaking of the kind or anything like the scale of this picture of Indian life.  There were seventy-five Indians at the World's fair.  Here there will be at least 500.  On the great feast days, like the Sun Dance of the Sioux and the Dog Feast of the Blackfeet, thousands of red braves will dance and revel amid the calm beauty of the white palaces.  Forty tribes are to be represented.  On Wednesday a howling throng of Winnebagoes kindled the quiet colonnades into a lurid gaiety.  They swept through them in fine savage style and perceptibly dimmed the attractions of the Midway.  Wickiups, tepees and wigwams already make a picturesque show on the new reservation.  Each tribe (and every tribe in the union will be represented) will wear its accustomed garb and have its usual weapons and industrial appliances.  It is expected that every Indian custom will be in plain view.  In short, the Indian life, a life already doomed and fast fading, will enact itself on a stage before the civilized world.  It is a pageant, a comedy and a tragedy in one that we shall see.  "Caesar, we who are about to die salute you!" cried the gladiators.  Silently the Indian race says the same grim words to the American who has destroyed him.</p>
                            <p>Even the children of this generation may hardly expect to see another such sight as this vast encampment on the Missouri, for the passing of the Indian will not be long.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="62" xml:id="TMISB06-062"/>
                            
                            <p>Probably never again will there be such an opportunity to study the real life and habits of the American Indian without going to the discomfort of living with him  The wigwam and the tepees and the dwellings of the red men who have advanced to rude houses will be erected and life will proceed precisely as on the reservations.  Captain Mercer of the United States army will be in charge.</p>
                            <p>A congress of choral societies will add to the diversions of the month of August.  The different societies will have separate numbers and will also be massed into one great chorus, and there will be papers and discussions of musical subjects as well.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, Omaha (with some aid from the pretty town across the river) is taking care of the multitude with more and more ease all the time.  Besides the two large hotels of the place there are a number of small hotels which have been highly praised.  And across the river in the peaceful town of Council Bluffs, looking at the hills and trees of the beautiful park which is the pride of the city, is one of the best hotels in the country.  I stayed there myself.  The street railway runs past its doors and the ride in the electric cars is a cool one.</p>
                            <p>In my next letter I hope to speak of the Fine Arts and the Liberal Arts buildings and to know more of what promises to be most prominent and, in many respects, a wonderfully interesting display, the Indian settlement.</p>

                            <p>War against Spain was declared by the United States when the intervention resolutions passed by congress were signed on April 20.  One hundred and fourteen days later the peace protocol was approved by the respective governments and the war ended.</p>
                            <p>The substantial fruits of the war for the United States are the freedom of Cuba under American protectorate, American ownership of Porto Rico, of one of the Ladrone islands and of so much of the Philippine group as may be determined by the peace commissioners.</p>
                            <p>Financially the war cost the United States to date a trifle less than $120,000,000.  But many contracts and like obligations already entered into and partly fulfilled will largely increase to total.  Computations made at Washington, based on maintaining the present strength of the army for a year, place the cost up to June 30, 1899, at from $500,000,000 to $600,000,000.</p>
                            <p>The loss of life in battle on the American side was 274; including the Maine disaster, 551; wounded estimated at 1,580.</p>
                            <p>The inception of the war goes back to February 24, 1895, when the insurrection broke out in three of Cuba's six provinces.  It raged with varying success for three years when the United States became involved.  The chief events leading up to and during the war are as follows:</p>
                            <p>January 24&#8212;Battleship Maine ordered to Havana on a peaceful mission.</p>
                            <p>February 9&#8212;Spanish Minister De Lome's private letter, reflecting on President McKinley, published.</p>
                            <p>February 10&#8212;Spanish Minister De Lome recalled.</p>
                            <p>February 15&#8212;Battleship Maine blown up in Havana harbor; 266 lives lost.</p>
                            <p>February 17&#8212;Board of inquiry into the loss of the Maine appointed.</p>
                            <p>February 21&#8212;Board of inquiry beings investigation at Havana.</p>
                            <p>March 9&#8212;Emergency bill, appropriating $50,000,000 for national defense, passed by congress.</p>
                            <p>March 19&#8212;Maine board of inquiry finishes its labors.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.&#8212;Although the war with Spain lasted only 114 days, it is estimated that it has cost the government so far $150,000,000, of which $98,000,000 has been actually paid out of the treasury.  Beginning with March 1, when the first increases in the expenditures in anticipation of war became apparent in the daily expenditures of the treasury, the actual disbursements of this account have been approximately as follows:  March, army, $600,000; navy, $2,400,000; total, $3,000,000.  April, army, $1,200,000; navy, $9,800,000; total, $11,000,000.  May, army, $12,000,000; navy, $7,000,000; total, $19,000,000.  June, army, $16,500,000; navy, $6,500,000; total, $23,000,000.

                            <p>There was no particular feature on the grounds this morning aside from the influx of about the usual Monday morning crowd of new visitors.  The Business and Fraternal association of this city is represented by a portion of its members, but this is as far as its participation goes.  The wheelmen will participate in a parade on the bluff tract at 7 o'clock tonight, but whether the event will bring out a full attendance of the various wheeling organizations is not certain.  The feature was organized on the supposition that the management would encourage it by providing an evening half-rate for the wheelmen, but this has been refused and they will have to pay the full admission.  The wheelmen will not parade outside of the grounds, but will meet on the bluff tract shortly before 7 o'clock.  They will form in line and parade through the grounds, after which they will be turned over to their own pursuits.  The clubs will make their headquarters at the German village, where special arrangements have been made to entertain <choice><sic>theim</sic><corr>them</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>The exposition crowd of yesterday was a forcible argument to the effect that the majority of the people do not propose to pay 50 cents to see half a show half a day when they can see the whole thing for the same money on any of the other six days of the week.  Aside from a few people who found it inconvenient to visit the grounds during the week the local attendance was the lightest that has been registered on any pleasant Sunday since the exposition opened.  The enclosure was redeemed from almost absolute desolation by a good proportion of the St. Joe crowd of yesterday who remained over to see the features that they had been compelled to slight the day before.  With these as auxiliaries the day was fairly successful and the crowd increased very perceptibly in the evening.</p>
                            <p>The feature of the day was the initial concert of the Mexican band, which was played on the portico of the Government building at 2 o'clock.  To say that the musicians made a favorable impression would be far too mild an expression.  "Isn't that band a crackerjack?" was the query frequently heard and it very accurately expresses the sentiment of the crowd.  The Mexicans play with a precision suggestive of the most conscientious rehearsal and every note seems to be at the absolute command of the leader's baton.  They play the same standard compositions that are played by the first-class bands of this country, with occasionally a Mexican dance interjected by way of variety.  Their rendition is marked by rare musical taste and the success of their first appearance indicates that their concerts will be the most enjoyable out door musical features that exposition patrons have yet enjoyed.</p>
                            <p>The initial program was introduced by a march and a waltz that were new to the audience and then they caught the crowd with their virile rendition of the overture, "America," with its succession of patriotic melodies.  A very pretty Mexican dance selection was given in response to the encore and then the fantasie from "Faust" was played with a degree of artistic conception that was a revelation in band music.  At times an effect almost similar to an orchestra was produced and the interpretation was full of delicacy and fire in exactly the right proportion.  Another decided success was scored in the rendition of Bucalossi's famous descriptive fantasie, "The Hunter," in which the band showed itself a master of this class of music as well.  Another fantasie and the finale, a Mexican dance, completed the program.</p>
                            <p>The evening concert was received with even greater appreciation.  The program included such local favorites of the overture from "William Tell" and the fantasie from "Cavallieria Rusticana," together with a succession of less familiar compositions that were heard with equal favor.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Texas and Oklahoma Making a Great Show of the Product.</head>
                            <p>There is a great rivalry between Editor Golobie of Oklahoma and Prof. Atwater of Texas.  These men are in charge of the agricultural exhibits from their respective states and both are located in the Agricultural building.  Golobie has his exhibit in the east end and Atwater has his in the west end of the building.  They are both long on corn and they both have long corn, hence the aforesaid rivalry.</p>
                            <p>Some days ago Prof. Atwater received a consignment of this year's sheaf corn from Texas.  It was fourteen feet high and the ears, which ran from three to five to the stalk, were higher than a man could reach.  Proceeding to the exhibit, the fire of jealousy consumed the editor from Oklahoma and he immediately wired home to send him some corn.  It came, and when it reached here it was nailed to the side of the Oklahoma booth.  From root to top of <choice><sic>tassle</sic><corr>tassel</corr></choice> it measured sixteen feet.  Atwater looked at the display but never said a word.  Last week Golobie got in another consignment of corn.  It came from Norman and measured an even eighteen feet from root to top of stem.  The stalks bear eight ears each, which are from nine to fifteen feet from the roots.  With the corn there was a certificate that it was planted on May 15 and that when it got its growth, it would be at least three feet higher.  Atwater saw this corn, but again he remained silent and nursed the scorn that he felt.  Yesterday he got his revenge.  Corn he had telegraphed for arrived and was put in place in the Texas exhibit.  It is two inches higher than that shown by Golobie.  He is not satisfied with this, however, and in order to rub it in on the man from Oklahoma, he took half a dozen stuffed monkeys from his exhibit, mounted a step ladder and tied the little creatures well up among the ears.  Then proceeding to the Oklahoma booth, he invited Golobie down to see his corn.  Golobie gazed in astonishment and finally asked:  What are those monkeys doing up there?"</p>
                            <p>"Picking corn," gleefully replied Atwater.  "The corn grows so big down in our state that we have to send monkeys up the stalks to break off the ears and throw them down to the huskers.  After that we chop the stalks and use them for stove wood, saw logs and ship masts."</p>
                            <p>The Oklahoma editor acknowledges that he has been beaten on corn, but declares that before the exposition is over he will show some corn that will also put the Texas man to shame.  He also says that this week he will have a car of water melons and that most of them will be sent direct to the Agricultural building and that from there they will be given away.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Railroads Not Ready to Make the Concessions Promised the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The all important question in the minus of exposition officials at this time is the prospective action of the Western Passenger association in regard to a general reduction in exposition rates.  It had been confidently expected that the concession would be granted before this, but the unexpected opposition of the Chicago &amp; Alton line interfered, and now the exposition people are hoping that the matter will be settled Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>While the matter is hanging fire the department of transportation is seriously embarrassed in its efforts to secure concessions for special days.  The railroads are reluctant to act until the general proposition is disposed of for fear of complicating the matter and so far no rate has been secured for the big conventions of colored Americans which meet in this city during the latter part of the week.  Manager Babcock has wired the managers of each road requestioning them to consider this an exceptional case and act independently, and it is hoped that favorable replies will be received today or tomorrow.  Saturday is the Colored-American day on the grounds, and the management expects that there will be an exceptionally heavy attendance if the rates can be secured in time.</p>

                            <p>The lack of a central authority which has repeatedly caused embarrassment to exposition guests was again illustrated in connection with the visit of the St. Joseph people Saturday.  The visitors brought with them a band and a number of tallyho coaches and a special arrangement was made with General Manager Clarkson by which the coaches were to be admitted to the Midway for parade purposes during the afternoon.  But when they tried to enter the gate they were met by a determined refusal on the part of the gatekeepers.  They declared that their orders were to let in no vehicles at that hour and they proposed to obey them.  General <choice><sic>Managr</sic><corr>Manager</corr></choice> Clarkson was summoned and hastened to set the matter right, but without success.  The gatekeeper was reinforced by Secretary Wakefield, who averred that nothing less than a resolution adopted by the executive committee would admit the vehicles.  The orders of the general manager were set aside and even when President Wattles added his persuasions the admission was still refused.  Finally after the patience of the visitors had been pretty nearly exhausted the ridiculous aspect of the situation was appreciated and the coaches were admitted.</p>
                            <p>These clashes of authority and the resultant jangles between the heads of various exposition departments are so common that they ordinarily attract very little notice except from those who are inconvenienced thereby.  A very pointed instance occurred some time ago when the executive committee spent two hours a day for several <choice><sic>successiv</sic><corr>successive</corr></choice> days in trying to decide what department manager should have charge of the admission of vehicles to the grounds.  Manager Babcock suggested that anything that came in on wheels would very properly come under the direction of the Department of Transportation.  Manager Kirkendall differed very vigorously.  He stated that he was the head of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, and as the wagons undoubtedly came in on the grounds it was eminently fitting that it should be his business to regulate them.</p>
                            <p><choice><sic>The</sic><corr>Then</corr></choice> came Manager Lindsey, who alleged that while the vehicles undoubtedly came in on wheels and traversed Manager Kirkendall's grounds in the course of their peregrinations they still remained subject to the Department of Admissions because they came through the gates.</p>
                            <p>All this time Manager Reed had been waiting for his turn and he proceeded to intervene to the effect that since these vehicles came to deliver supplies to the various concessions they were a part of his department and subject to his supervision.  Each manager was insistent on what he considered his prerogatives and the committee spent meeting after meeting in a jangle over their conflicting claims.</p>
                            <p>There is scarcely a day that does not develop some similar conflict of authority to justify the position taken by The Bee from the beginning in favor of a director general or general manager, who should be something more than a figurehead and have the authority to settle disputed questions without an incessant jangle over the relative prerogatives of the heads of the various departments.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Rev. Celia Parker Woolley Discourses to an Exposition Congregation.</head>
                            <p>The only religious service held in Omaha yesterday at which no collection was taken occurred at the Auditorium at 4 o'clock.  It was held under the direction of the committee of local clergymen which was appointed by General Manager Clarkson some time ago and which was represented by Rev. T. J. Mackay of All Saints Episcopal church.  The heat was very oppressive in the building and this largely accounted for the preponderance of vacant seats.  The sermon was delivered by Rev. Celia Parker Woolley of Chicago, who talked briefly but vigorously on the subject, "Things Commonly Believed Among Us."  She said at the outset that the term "us" did not refer to this audience nor to one locality, but to all mankind.  Man was everywhere a creature of love and worship.  The capacity to recognize the claims of suffering brethren and the power we have to relieve our fellow men are the essence of religious life wherever we find it.  Any man who recognizes in himself evil motives and good motives, selfish purposes and unselfish purposes, is a believer whether he conforms to any particular creed or not.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="64" xml:id="TMISB06-064"/>
                            
                            <p>Rev. Woolley contended that after all a belief in the main tenets of religion is common to all men.  All agree in the belief in a power outside of themselves and they differ only in the minor points of name and theories and creed.  But in all the emotions and aspirations that underlie the surface they are one the world over.  We are beginning to see this.  The principle of unity is becoming more generally recognized and established.  It exists in this exposition, which brings men together to compare notes on their material resources and these Auditorium services were a step in the same direction.  They bring speakers of different denominations in order that the people might compare notes and grow closer together in their religious beliefs.</p>
                            <p>The speaker suggested that a new idea of reverence is another result of modern religious thought.  Men once believed that religion meant the mere acceptance of an intellectual statement propounded as the doctrine of a recognized creed.  But we are <choice><sic>ocming</sic><corr>coming</corr></choice> to see that this is entirely too shallow a conception.  Religion means a belief in a power for righteousness within ourselves and the conviction that compels us to ally ourselves with that power.  So reverence no longer meant merely an austere attention to church services, but the fear of God in our hearts.  Reverence was not for the past alone, but it was also for the present.  It was a divine spark within ourselves and not an outward assumption of sanctity.</p>
                            <p>The singing was conducted by Walter Wilkins of Trinity cathedral choir, who also contributed a solo, and Thomas J. Kelly officiated as organist.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FIXING UP THE SICK INDIANS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Hospital Staff Kept Busy Handing Out White Man's Medicine.</head>
                            <p>Mrs. Petrified Buffalo, a Sioux Indian woman, is firmly convinced that the medicine of the white man has some merits.  Yesterday Mrs. Buffalo partook quite liberally of green corn and cucumbers.  An hour later she developed a severe case of cholera morbus.  She writhed in agony on the straw on the floor of her tepee.  All of the mixtures of the Indian medicine chest were tried, but they failed to afford the relief sought.  A Red Cross wagon call was turned in and Mrs. Buffalo was carted down to the hospital.  She was put to bed and the usual remedies were prescribed.  In less than half an hour the woman was able to walk back to the camp.</p>
                            <p>The cure of Mrs. Buffalo was a signal for all of the sick Indians to begin an attack upon the hospital and from noon until late at night Drs. Strader and Campbell had all that they could do.  Comes in a Hurry was the first Indian to go upon the operating table.  He was dancing around the camp, having about the same action of a man who imbibed too freely of Mountain Dew.  He could not tell what ailed him, but merely pointed to his head.  After sticking one of his index fingers into his ear he let out a howl loud enough to drown the sound of the spielers at the concessions.  Running at race horse speed from the Indian camp, Comes in a Hurry made a beeline for the hospital and grabbing one of the doctors pointed to his own ear.  The Indian was flopped upon the operating table and an instant later both doctors were probing his ear.  Continuing their investigations they drew out a bug fully an inch long.  It had crawled into Mr. Hurry's ear while he was lying on the straw in his tent.</p>
                            <p>Late last night a party of ten Indians, including one man, four women and five children, called at the hospital, all having ailments.  They were treated and returned to the camp happy.  If the rush of business continues the hospital authorities are of the opinion that the building will have to be enlarged before the end of the week.</p>
                            <p>So successful have Drs. Strader and Campbell been in curing Indians that they have been designated as the Big Medicine men and have been named Whehaty Koiltun Ishisi, or They Who Cure Every Time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Change in Arrangements is Due to the Railroads.</head>
                            <p>ST. LOUIS, Aug. 14.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;F. M. Sterrett, president and executive director of the Missouri commission to the Transmississippi exposition at Omaha, has written a letter to the president of the exposition canceling "Missouri Day," which had been set for August 20.  The program had been arranged and the Missouri commission were awaiting a 1-cent a mile rate from the railroads before announcing it.  Instead of that rate, Mr. Sterrett wrote, the railroads would only make a rate of one fare for the round trip so it has been decided to declare off "Missouri Day."</p>
                            <p>"If the conditions should hereafter seem more favorable," concluded Mr. Sterrett, "another day can be fixed for 'Missouri Day,' but if as good results can be obtained by working up attendance on several different days for particular localities we will, in either case, do all in our power to have as large a Missouri attendance as possible."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Dull Day for the Red Men.</head>
                            <p>Captain Mercer's Indians found exposition life almost as monotonous yesterday as everyday life upon their respective reservations.  During the morning some of them attended religious services at Trinity cathedral, but the majority remained in their tepees, or visited one another.  The afternoon was even more irksome and few of the red men got out into the heat of the sun.  They remained in the shade, stretched full length upon the ground and either smoked their pipes or slept.  No attempt was made at dancing or giving entertainments, though a few of the young boys got out and shot at pennies the whites put up to test the Indian marksmanship with the bow and arrow.</p>
                            <p>The Cheyenne River Sioux, who came in a couple of days ago from South Dakota, seemed to be the center of attraction yesterday and the tent occupied by the chiefs, Charger and Two Tails, drew the crowds.  Neither of the Indians speak English, but they have their interpreter along.  This man is highly educated and reads and writes.  Of the two chiefs, Charger is the most noted.  In fact he is one of the most noted and most powerful men of the Sioux.  He is 67 years of age and is rich, owning about 1,000 head of cattle and 500 horses.  Years ago he was a great warrior and gathered about him a tribe of the bravest of the western Indians.  As an orator he has no equal among the Indians, and for this reason he has always appeared in the councils of the tribe.  Whenever a delegation has been sent to Washington to confer with congress or with the president, relative to matters pertaining to the Indians, Charger has been the spokesman for the delegation.  He stands nearly seven feet high and notwithstanding his age, is as straight as an arrow.  He has discarded the Indian dress, yet during some of the parades to be given by the Indian congress, he may wear a blanket, but usually he wears a neat fitting suit of black, fashionable shoes and a white shirt.  Yesterday he was dressed in a suit of black broadcloth and if seen upon the street under his broad brimmed brown hat, he would have passed for a rich planter or stockman.</p>

                            <p>Four special events are scheduled on the exposition program this week in addition to the permanent attractions of the show.  Today is Wheelmen's day and a large proportion of the local wheelmen will participate in a parade to the grounds, where they will spend the day and evening.  It is also notable as the day for the Business and Fraternal association of Omaha and the double attraction is expected to produce a good Monday crowd.</p>
                            <p>The Texans will own the grounds Thursday and they have prepared for quite an elaborate celebration.  A very low rate has been made from all Texas points and several large excursions are booked from that state.</p>
                            <p>Saturday will be devoted to the Colored Americans and as two large conventions of colored people will congregate in Omaha during the latter part of the week a large attendance is assured.  Special railroad rates have been secured and excursions will be run from Kansas City, St. Joseph, Atchison and various other <choice><sic>citiies</sic><corr>cities</corr></choice> that have a large proportion of colored population.</p>

                            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Frederic Phinney left last night for Chicago, following the band, which went yesterday morning.</p>
                            <p>The offices of the Buildings and Grounds department were moved this morning from the cottage on the bluff tract to the second floor of the service building.</p>
                            <p>The Missouri Pacific railroad has given the Missouri commission free transportation for a car of peaches, which will arrive at the Horticulture building in a few days.</p>
                            <p>W. S. Streator of Minneapolis, the expert accountant recently employed by the special committee to audit the accounts of the exposition, will begin active work this morning.  He spent a part of the day yesterday at the Service building examining the bookkeeping methods and securing such other information from Secretary Wakefield as would enable him to take up the task systematically.</p>
                            <p>The east gate at Twentieth and Manderson streets has been moved up flush with Twentieth street in order to avoid trouble with neighboring property owners who pass through the grounds at that point.  The change will make it easy to see that the people who come in at one side go out at the other and it is thought that it will do away with a large proportion of the misunderstandings that have occurred on this account.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation has received a letter from the Central Passenger association in which it is intimated that a more effective regulation of scalpers by the local authorities is essential if the exposition is to receive any further favors from that association in the matter of rates.  The communication is sent in connection with the notification that the central association has made a rate of one fare plus $4 for the round trip on Commercial Travelers' day, but it is plainly stated that unless the organization is protected from the scalpers the rate will not be put in force.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Experience in Connection with St. Joseph Day a Convincing One.</head>
                            <p>The Missouri Pacific took back a large number of the St. Joseph excursionists on Sunday evening in two special trains.  One left the exposition grounds at 6 p. m., and the other at 11 p. m.  As the excursion tickets have a limit of five days many of the St. Joseph people are still in town, and quite a number will remain here until Wednesday.  Those who did not return on the special train on Sunday night are going back on the regular trains of the Missouri Pacific and of the Burlington between now and Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>The railroad men express themselves as highly pleased with the success of the St. Joseph excursion.  Both of the lines did a richly paying business in hauling the 2,000 St. Joseph people up here and back, and they split just about even in their receipts.  A rate of $1.75 for the round trip, or three-fifths of 1 cent per mile, was made for the excursion, and a reasonable limit (five days) granted to the purchasers of the tickets.  In speaking of the success of the excursion one railroad man said to a Bee reporter:  "The result justifies the contention that if a low excursion rate is made for the special days a large crowd can be secured from almost every city and town in this part of the west.  The argument that we must wait until after the crops are harvested before putting in low rates would appear to have been exploded, for there are some other people besides farmers who want to see this show.  But we don't make the rates, you know, that's done higher up."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Many Headed Management of the Exposition in Another Blunder.</head>
                            <head type="sub">ARRANGEMENTS AT THE GATES INCOMPLETE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Riders Unable to Secure Admission Through the Inability of the Several Departments to Get Close Enough Together.</head>
                            <p>The many-headed management of the exposition has come very near to making Wheelmen's day a failure.  The various managers, relying on each other to make the necessary arrangements, have made one.  The natural consequence is that visiting wheelmen are disgusted, and the plans which the local committee have worked up are spoiled.</p>
                            <p>"I am thoroughly disgusted with the way the management has carried on things," declared State Consul O'Brien, who is at the head of the committee on arrangements and who has worked hard during the last four weeks in getting things in shape for the day and securing the presence of wheelmen.  "That management has spoiled the plans we have been working on a long time.  It will send away the wheelmen visitors with a very poor opinion of the city.  It will result in a parade just about half as big and attractive as it otherwise would have been."</p>
                            <p>Four weeks ago Consul O'Brien made arrangements with President Wattles that wheels should be admitted today.  Ordinarily wheels are barred from the grounds, but President Wattles volunteered permission to allow them inside all day, providing that the wheelmen did not ride them until 6 o'clock in the evening.  Naturally a visiting wheelmen would not care to leave his wheel down town and go to the exposition during the day, and then pay another admission to take in his wheel in the evenings to take part in the parade on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Shortly after 9 o'clock this morning a big batch of the visiting wheelmen and wheelwomen went to the wagon entrance on Sherman avenue, south of the viaduct, where it was understood they would be admitted with their wheels.  Among the number were fifty wheelmen from Sioux City
                            
                            <pb n="65" xml:id="TMISB06-065"/>
                            
                            <note type="handwritten">Wheelmen's day Con.</note><lb/> and Council Bluffs.  There was a Denver contingent and representatives from other cities.  When they reached the gate they were refused admission.</p>
                            <p>The party put itself in communication with Consul O'Brien, who went at once to see President Wattles.  The latter said that orders would be issued at once to admit the wheelmen.  The party waited before the entrance for an hour, but no orders to let them in arrived.  By this time O'Brien reached the grounds and by energetic hustling secured an order from the bureau of admissions to let the wheelmen enter with their wheels.  When this order arrived, however, it was not found to be sufficiently authoritative, for the gatekeeper refused admission until an inspector was at hand.  No inspector could be found.</p>
                            <p>By this time the wheelmen were a very disgusted lot of individuals, as they had been waiting for nearly two hours.  Finally a big majority of them checked their wheels on the outside and went in.  Others left for the heart of the city.  At 12:30 Consul O'Brien saw President Wattles once more and the latter wrote out an order to admit the wheelmen with their wheels.  This was sent out to the grounds early in the afternoon, so that it may be possible that admission to wheels will finally be given.</p>
                            <p>"But it is too late," declared Consul O'Brien.  "By the time the order reached there most of our visitors were in the grounds and had left their wheels outside.  Of course, none of them will pay another admission to get their wheels and help us out on the parade.  The result will be that our parade will be nothing like what we planned it, although we will do the best we can."</p>
                            <p>There is quite a contingent of wheelmen and wheelwomen in the city.  Early in the morning the Sioux City, Denver and Council Bluffs crowd came in and later there were various representations from towns in this state, especially Beatrice, Lincoln and Plattsmouth.</p>
                            <p>The principal feature of the day is to be the wheelmen's parade this evening shortly after 6 o'clock.  There will be a variety of decorated wheels and floats in line in addition to a lot of wheelmen.  Consul O'Brien estimated that fully 800 riders would have been in line had wheels been admitted, but it is quite probable that the number will fall far short of that now.</p>

                            <p>Chicago, Ill., Aug. 13.&#8212;Following is a copy of the letter sent to local commercial and social clubs by the Illinois Trans-Mississippi and International exposition commission in regard to Chicago day at the Omaha fair:</p>
                            <p>Chicago, Ill., Aug. 11.&#8212;Gentlemen: Saturday, October 1, 1898, has been set apart as "Chicago day" at the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition at Omaha.  The railroads at Chicago reaching Omaha have not yet announced their rates for this day, but it is known that they will treat the subject in their usual liberal spirit and the public will have no cause to complain, when it is made known through the public press.</p>
                            <p>The trains on all lines leave Chicago in the evening, arriving at Omaha next morning about 8 o'clock.  It is confidently believed that before this time peace will have been concluded and many, if not all, of our brave soldiers will have returned to the vocations of civil life.  Let us make this a day of general rejoicing, because of the wonderful victories of our army and navy, and because of the advancement of our country among the nations of the earth.</p>
                            <p>Our business men leaving Chicago Friday evening, September 30 (the fair being open Sunday), can have two days sight-seeing and leave for Chicago Sunday evening, reaching home Monday morning.  It is unnecessary to say that the fair is in every way a success and worthy of the support of our citizens.  Mayor Harrison has accepted an invitation to be present and will deliver an address, subject, "Chicago." Senator Mason will speak, subject, "Our Country." Charles G. Dawes, comptroller of the currency, will deliver an address, subject, "The Relation of the West to Chicago."</p>
                            <p>Other distinguished speakers will be present and be given a place on the program.  Special cars can be provided for your members to go as a club.  The Illinois commissioners cordially and earnestly invite your club to participate and co-operate in making the day a memorable one.  An early answer is requested.</p>

The organization is a temporary one incident to the exposition, that artists in the transmississippi country might be brought together through the impetus of the exposition to exchange ideas and receive suggestions from each other as to the progress of their work.

On Tuesday evening there will be a lantern slide exhibition, when photographs will be thrown upon a canvass and criticised by the photographers from a professional standpoint.  Wednesday evening the visitors will be taken in a body on a tour through the Midway at the exposition.  The bill for Thursday evening has not yet been prepared, but it is possible it will be in the shape of a banquet.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WHEELMEN'S DAY A COMPLETE FIZZLE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Complications Between Departments and Bureau Result in the Discomfiture of the Bicycle Riders Who Sought to Make a Show.</head>
                            <p>Today's exposition visitors have nothing in prospect except the permanent attractions of the show, but that these are sufficient to fully entertain the people is apparent in the manner in which the attendance is sustained.  Most of the strangers who were on the grounds yesterday are again in evidence, and they were reinforced today by hundreds of excursionists who did not arrive in time to get out before.  The increasing proportions of the morning crowds that are entirely composed of people who come purely to see the exhibits is regarded with satisfaction.  These form a class of visitors to whom the exposition is something more than a mere pleasure resort, and the interest in the exhibits is constantly becoming more apparent.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the misunderstanding between the various departments and bureaus in control of the grounds Wheelmen's day was a complete fizzle.  Each individual department or bureau seemed anxious to make the affair a success, but they failed to get together, and the wheelmen were sorely disappointed lot.  The early morning difficulty at the gates was remedied by Superintendent Foster of buildings and grounds, who sent out a couple of office boys to allay the feelings of the wheelmen.  These lads informed the riders that they could check their wheels outside and leave them there until 6 o'clock and they would see that they were brought upon the grounds in time for the parade.  Some of the men accepted the proposition, but more went home in disgust, declaring that they had been buncoed.  The situation, however, was remedied a l<unclear reason="torn"/>ing the afternoon and as more whee<unclear reason="torn"/> to arrive they were allowed to enter the grounds, their wheels being taken care of by A. J. Webb of the Admissions department.</p>
                            <p>The climax of the difficulty was reached, however, just before 7 o'clock, the hour fixed for the parade.  Major Llewellyn, chief of the exposition police, had not been informed of any parade and consequently had issued no orders to the night men who were on duty at the time.  There is a rule that bicycles are not allowed on the grounds and when Chief Consul O'Brien started out along the Midway to notify his men to get their wheels and prepare for the parade, he was halted and pulled off his bicycle.  He tried to explain, but the guards informed him that they had no instructions and consequently could do nothing.  No exposition officers were on the grounds at this hour and as a result no arrangements could be made.</p>
                            <p>At this point Superintendent Foster threw himself into the breach and broke a rule to the extent of informing Mr. O'Brien that if he could get a party together he would take the responsibility of allowing the members to ride.  O'Brien did not think he could traverse the grounds on foot nor did he care to do so and informed those about him to this effect.  He said that if the wheelmen were willing he would declare the parade off.  All of the wheelmen within hearing of his voice were willing and so voted and the parade was a complete flunk.</p>

                            <p>The beginning of the present week has wrought many changes in the fruit display in the Horticulture building, all of which are pleasing to the visitors.  Ever since the opening of the exposition a certain degree of freshness has pervaded the building each Monday morning, but yesterday it seemed that the exhibitors had tried to outdo all previous efforts.  The tables were all cleaned and nothing but the freshest fruit was displayed.</p>
                            <p>Iowa has come to the front with its pears and Superintendent Collman takes great pride in showing seven varieties.  Superintendent Collman returned yesterday from a short trip among the fruit growers of the state and while absent secured promises from a number of the fruit raisers who have promised to keep the tables supplied until the close of the exposition.  Mr. Collman says that Adams county has a big apple crop and that the quality is above the average.</p>
                            <p>California continues to add to its exhibit and Superintendent Wilson is delighted over the shipment of another consignment of fruit from Los Angeles.  The shipment contains Kelsey, Japan, Silver Plume and Satsuma plums, the latter having meat that is blood red.  He also received a large quantity of Valances oranges, which are the first to arrive from any locality.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska fruit table presided over by Superintendent Peter Youngers continues to attract the admiration of all who visit the Horticulture building.  He has assigned a space 12x24 feet to the peaches and on this he has something like twenty varieties, including the Early Risers, Hale and Alexander, peaches that are supposed to grow only in the south.  About all of the old apples have been disposed of and the exhibit is complete with fruit of the present season.  Besides this there are paw-paws, Damson plums, cherries and grapes.</p>
                            <p>With the exhibits now being shown Nebraska is starting a great boom as a fruit raising state.</p>
                            <p>The State Experimental farm of Illinois is doing the clever thing in the way of furnishing fruit for the Illinois exhibit.  It has forwarded twelve varieties of pears, a large quantity of peaches and some apples.</p>

                            <p>The continual conflict of authority between various departments of the exposition is seriously embarrassing to some of its officials as well as to the public.  One exasperating difficulty occurs in connection with the band concerts.  These are scheduled at certain hours every day, but they are continually being interfered with by arrangements made by officials outside of the music department.  For instance, the Mexican band has been promised for the Auditorium on Bohemian Turner's day at an hour when it should be giving the regular afternoon concert on the grounds.  On Lumberman's day the band concert, the log rolling contest and the life saving exhibition have all been scheduled at the same hour by the various heads who have charge of one and the other.  Unless a more systematic arrangement is effected three features which would otherwise entertain the people all the afternoon will be bunched at one time and the visitors will be compelled to see one at the cost of missing the other two.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AFFAIRS AT THE INDIAN CONGRESS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Clash Between Authorities Results in Favor of Uncle Sam Again.</head>
                            <p>Yesterday there was a little clash between the authorities at the Indian encampment and some of the exposition people, and, as usual, some of the Indian people came out ahead.</p>
                            <p>It so happens that the South Omaha Ice company has the contract for supplying ice on the exposition grounds.  When the Indians were installed the wagons of this company proceeded to fill the water tanks and cooling rooms with ice.  Later on it was discovered that the ice was dirty.  Nothing was done until yesterday morning.  At that time the ice wagon drove into the grounds and the man in charge was informed that the Indian congress needed no more of his ice.  He drove away in a huff and a few moments later an independent ice firm drove an ice wagon up to the gate at the west end of the enclosure.  The guard on duty at that point refused to allow him to pass.  Assistant Manager Wise of the congress was called and went to the place.  He demanded that the man be allowed to enter and fill the ice chests and tanks with ice, but the guard, thinking that he knew his business, still refused.  Mr. Wise made a hurried trip to the general offices and stated the case.  He was chased from one room to another, each official appearing to be in blissful ignorance of who had the authority to pass the wagon into the grounds.  The officials were informed that the Indian congress was not a side show to the exposition, but was an independent exhibit, just as much so as that in the government building.  The government was putting up the money and the men in charge had a right to go into the market and buy their supplies where they saw fit.  The officials could not see things in this light, but in a few minutes they were brought to their senses by being informed that if the ice wagon was not admitted to the Indian grounds the east gates would be locked and would remain so until the secretary of the interior could be communicated with.  This information was telephoned to President Wattles, and within five seconds was hurrying back an order to pass any wagon recommended by the men in charge of the camp.  Armed with this order, Mr. Wise returned to the camp and the gates swung open as soon as the guard was informed of its contents.</p>
                            <p>People who visit the Indian congress are complaining because the gate at the south end of the grounds, just west of the north end of the Miniature railway is not opened to the public.  They contend that with this gate closed, they are compelled to go way out to the Transportation building and then half a mile around to reach the enclosure where the dances are given and the games are played.</p>
                            <p>The gate referred to is kept closed both day and night, but the blame all attaches to the Department of Building and Grounds of the exposition.  Several times Captain Mercer has requested that the gate be opened, but no attention has been paid to his requests.  To reach the point where the festivities are held would require the construction of a roadway and the painting of a sign, directing the people where to go.  This could all be done in a single day if two men were put to work, but they are not put to work and there it is.</p>
                            <p>At last the arc lights on the grounds of the Indian congress have been located and are ready to burn.  Heretofore the grounds have been as dark as a squaw's pocket, simply because the committee having the work in hand refused to get a hustle on itself.  Captain Mercer requested the lights two weeks ago, but owing to the <choice><sic>dilitory</sic><corr>dilatory</corr></choice> tactics pursued nothing was done for several days, and probably nothing would have been done yet if it had not been for the continued prodding that was begun and continued.</p>

                            <p>The management is forming plans for a big reunion of veteran soldiers in connection with the grand peace jubilee, which will occur September 9 to 15.  It was thought that no more appropriate time could be selected for bringing the old soldiers together and steps will be immediately undertaken to secure a big mobilization of veterans from all over the United States.  It will not be a Grand Army of the Republic reunion, although that organization will be largely represented.  It is proposed to extend the courtesies of the grounds to the confederate veterans as well, and make the occasion a big reunion of the blue and the gray in celebration of the victory of a common cause.  Invitations will be extended to all the various organizations of federal and confederate veterans and an effort will also be made to secure the presence of many of their old leaders.  These, with the presence of President McKinley and the members of his cabinet, will make the occasion the most notable event of the exposition, and, it is believed, that with favorable railroad rates, the total attendance will mount into six figures during most of the week.</p>

                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee, held yesterday, the question of enlarging the Indian congress was taken under consideration and Hon. James Mooney of the Bureau of Ethnology of the United States employed.  Mr. Mooney will visit the southern Indians and secure the attendance of representatives from the Zuni and other tribes residing in New Mexico and Arizona.</p>
                            <p>It was decided to have fireworks on Wednesday and Saturday nights.  These fireworks will be on the north tract beyond the Midway.</p>

                            <p>The most extensive addition to the display in the Government building that has been made since the exposition opened arrived this morning and will be installed today and tomorrow.  This is all consigned to the naval exhibit and includes the working model of a modern dry dock together with the model of the battleship Illinois, a 4-inch rapid fire gun and the breech mechanism of a 13-inch breech-loading rifle.  These features are all of exceptional interest and were secured by Captain Stedman during his recent trip to Washington.  The battleship will be floated in the dry dock and an exhibition of the manner of docking and undocking the big fighting machine will be given at stated hours each day.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Wigman's plan is to have a class of ten boys at work in the workshop during certain hours of the day until the opening of school he will have two or more classes alternating with each other, as he has secured twenty-four passes for his boys.  When school opens, however, he proposes to have the class consist of second-year pupils, who will probably work at the exposition during the noon hour.</p>

Ex-Governor Northern says that the Georgia people feel a deep interest in the exposition and will do all in their power to make it a success.

                            <p>A party of 300 persons came in from Frontier county last night for a week's stay at the exposition.  They were met at the depot by Colonel Richardson of the Department of Publicity and given a hearty welcome.  They had secured rooms in advance in the north part of the city, to which they repaired.  The party is in charge of A. F. Webster of Beaver City.</p>

Speaking of the exposition, Mr. Easley said:  "It is wonderful and is as fine a display of the products and resources of the great transmississippi region as could have been made."</p>
                            <p>Emmett May, a prominent insurance agent from Hawaii, is in Omaha for a few days visiting the exposition.  He likes the show very much and never tires of telling of the new things that he has seen here.  "It is the greatest display of the resources of the country that has ever been brought together.  It furnishes the most conclusive evidence of this great transmississippi region and is bound to bring in much money and many settlers.  The buildings are magnificent.  I like them and their arrangements much better than those at the World's fair."</p>
                            <p>Nelse Innes, representing the Boston Herald, is in the city for a few days visiting the exposition.  Speaking of the exposition he said:  "The people in the east do not understand the magnitude of the exposition.

It is better than that held at Atlanta, Nashville or San Francisco.  In fact it is about as good as the World's fair.  In some respects it is better."</p>
                            <p>C. H.

Hitchcock a week ago, which instructed the bureau of admissions to issue passes indiscriminately regardless of the authority of the Department of Promotion and Publicity, was defeated by the unanimous vote of the board of directors at the adjourned meeting yesterday afternoon.  Incidentally the motives of the mover of the resolution were very seriously questioned and several directors plainly declared that Mr. Hitchcock was seeking to gratify his personal antagonism toward Manager Rosewater without regard for the interests of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The matter was the first subject considered by the board and in the absence of Mr. Rosewater, Herman Kountze stated what he understood to be his objections to the resolution.  The question was then laid on the table until Mr. Rosewater's arrival a few minutes later.  At the request of the board Mr. Rosewater then called attention to the ridiculous proposition the resolution contemplated.  The board had first passed a resolution authorizing the issuance of certain passes to newspapers at the discretion of the manager of the Department of Promotion and Publicity and at the same time declared against an indiscriminate use of that authority.  Then Mr. Hitchcock had rushed through another resolution which directed the issuance of passes indiscriminately in entire conflict with the first resolution.  Mr. Rosewater declared that if it was not proposed to allow the department any discretion in the matter it was useless for him to be bothered by work that could as well be done by any clerk.  His department has made upwards of 500 contracts with the publishers of weekly newspapers for passes in return for mention of special events at the exposition from time to time.  If this resolution is adopted the people who have entered into these contracts in good faith will be put on the same footing with others who have absolutely refused to give the exposition the slightest support.  It will also work an injustice by putting the smallest weekly on a level with a daily.</p>

                            <head type="sub">No Politics in It.</head>
                            <p>In reply to a question Mr. Rosewater stated that no distinction has been made in the issuance of passes on account of the political tenets of any newspaper.  That feature has never been even considered and he cited several cases in point in support of the assertion.  The whole difficulty results from a great effort on the part of Mr. Hitchcock to make out that Mr. Rosewater is antagonistic to the country editors, when, as a matter of fact, he personally insists that the editors of weeklies should be allowed thirty-day passes when other members of the executive committee were disposed to limit them to five days.</p>
                            <p>C. S. Montgomery said that there was a good deal of truth in what Mr. Rosewater had said.  He was himself convinced that this resolution originated in an improper motive and he thought so from the start.  When Mr. Hitchcock precipitated this matter on the directory he did not have the good of the exposition in mind so much as his own personal antagonism to Mr. Rosewater.  His resolution, which is certainly in direct conflict with the previous resolution, was rushed through in three minutes after the other had been adopted and no one believed that the board had intended that no discretion should be exercised in the matter of passes.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze said that the remarks of the previous speaker were very pertinent.  The course contemplated by the Hitchcock resolution was entirely out of order and it was not a good business transaction.  After some further discussion the resolution was put to a vote and lost by the unanimous vote of all the members present.</p>
                            <p>A request from the publishers of the Omaha Excelsior to have monthly passes exchanged for a season pass was referred to the Department of Publicity and Promotion.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Hitchcock's Written <choice><sic>Comlpaint</sic><corr>Complaint</corr></choice>.</head>
                            <p>At this juncture Mr. Hitchcock again appeared in evidence through a letter, in which he vented his stereotyped complaint in regard to Manager Rosewater's department.  He declared that General Manderson has written that he has found people in Boston who know nothing of the exposition.  A commercial agency has been asked by a Philadelphia correspondent for information on the same subject and even the editor of the New York Evening Post is densely ignorant of the transmississippi show.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater took occasion to show that these allegations are ridiculously false, as their only recommendation is the superabundance of gall with which they are exploited in the face of facts that are self-evident.  As far as Philadelphia is concerned, all the large papers of that city have printed page after page of illustrated matter concerning the exposition.  Only recently the Pennsylvania State commission has been designated and every paper in Philadelphia has printed an article relative to the exposition and the plans for the participation of Pennsylvania.</p>
                            <p>It might be true that General Manderson found someone in Boston who did not know much about the exposition.  But everyone knows that a party that included the lieutenant governor and other prominent state officials was entertained here on Massachusetts day and their visit was given great prominence in the papers all over the state of Massachusetts.  The assertion relative to the editor of the Post is even more mendacious.  This is apparent because the editor of the New York Evening Post sat beside the speaker at a banquet in Chicago last spring, given to members of the Associated Press, 600 editors being present, and heard him speak at length on the subject.  Mr. Rosewater added that long before that he had conferred with the editor of the Post in New York in regard to the exposition and that this paper has published a considerable amount of matter descriptive of the enterprise.  He succeeded to still further administer to the Hitchcock complaint by briefly referring to some of the extensive advertising avenues through which the exposition has been brought to the notice of eastern people.  The Octave Thanet letters alone go into sixty of the largest newspapers in the United States every Sunday through the McClure syndicate, and large exposition posters have been billed in upwards of fifty cities.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Some Additional Advertising.</head>
                            <p>The Hitchcock communication was placed on file and John L. Webster stated for the information of the directors that at a conference at which the executive committee and several directors were present it had been decided to authorize Manager Rosewater and Dr. George L. Miller to visit the editors of the big dailies of the eastern cities with a view to inducing them to co-operate in bringing the exposition to the front and also to authorize Manager Rosewater's department to employ enough men to bill the railroad lines for 500 miles out from Omaha in each direction.  The resolutions contemplating these measures were adopted by a unanimous vote of the directory and John C. Wharton took occasion to remark that one members of the board who has just returned from Boston told him that he saw big exposition posters on every billboard and that he had similar reports from friends who have visited other large cities.  This talk that the exposition is not known in the east is ridiculous and everyone knows it.</p>
                            <p>In connection with this matter Mr. Rosewater called attention to a distorted report of the conference referred to which appeared in a local publication.  He stated that so far from being called to criticise his methods this conference was determined on at a conference between himself, President Wattles and Senator Thurston, at which the best means for utilizing the end of the war to bring the exposition prominently before the public were discussed.  The subsequent conference with members of the directory and the decision to authorize him to go east to see the publishers of the large papers were decided on unanimously and with his own approval.</p>

                            <p>The last in the interminable succession of Sunday closing petitions was placed on file and two reports from the investigating committee were presented.  The first, which related to the issuance of passes to fraternal organizations and similar matters, approved the action of the executive committee and was placed on file.  The other referred to the bootblacking concession of "Mogy" Bernstein and as it found that an injustice had been done it was laid over until Manager Reed returned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SPECIAL RATE FOR MISSOURI DAY.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Railroads Will Not Back Down if the Governor Has.</head>
                            <p>Although Governor Stephens of Missouri has announced that Missouri day at the exposition is off, the railroads entering Omaha from that "shown" state will offer the same reduced rates previously announced and expected to haul quite a few Missourians here on that date.  It is probable, too, according to several general passenger agents in Omaha, that an attempt will be made to fix another date later in the season for Missouri day, at which time it is hoped that the occasion may suit his excellency's convenience.</p>
                            <p>The railroads in the Western Passenger association made a rate of 1 cent per mile for Missouri day, to apply to all points in Missouri within 150 miles of Omaha and also to Kansas City.  Beyond this radius a rate of one regular fare for the round trip is offered.  The territory included in the 1 cent per mile district includes all the Missouri points on the Burlington's branch lines in that state and most places on the Missouri Pacific line and Port Arthur route in Missouri.</p>
                            <p>According to Governor Stephens these rates were not satisfactory and the eventful day was abandoned.  The only information that the Burlington and the Missouri Pacific offices in Omaha have received on the subject is that the arrangements for the day have been cancelled and no reason is assigned in the telegrams from St. Louis conveying this news.</p>
                            <p>The following extract from the Kansas City Star gives an idea of how the announcement was received in that Missouri town:</p>
                            <p>The railroad general passenger agents here are more than ordinarily incensed because Missouri day of the Omaha exposition has been abandoned.  E. S. Jewett, passenger agent here for the Missouri Pacific railway, says it is a "burning shame."</p>
                            <p>"All other states are to have days," said Mr. Jewett today; "and there is no good reason why Missouri should not."</p>
                            <p>The first positive knowledge of the abandonment reached Kansas City this morning by a telegram to Mr. Jewett from H. C. Townsend of St. Louis, general passenger and ticket agent of the Missouri Pacific.  It was a bare statement of the fact and brought no comment nor explanation.  The railroads blame Governor Stephens for it.</p>
                            <p>"There's politics in it somewhere," said a passenger man today.  "I imagine Lon Stephens is in it somewhere and you know what that means."</p>
                            <p>News of an incident in this connection that was never intended to reach the public comes from St. Louis.  A well known general passenger agent there received a letter from Governor Stephens a few days ago in which the governor was particularly bitter against the railroads for what he called their "niggardly" treatment of Missouri day in the nature of rates.  The railroad official's reply was as caustic as was the governor's letter.</p>
                            <p>"We have given you a rate of 1 cent a mile," he said in substance, "which has always been regarded in the history of railroads as the very lowest profitable rate for passenger travel even in large quantities.  I don't see why you should expect the railroads to carry all the burden.  I haven't heard that Missouri people will be able to eat or sleep any cheaper in Omaha on their day, or that they will pay any less than anybody else for admission to the grounds.  I regard your unreasonable demands on the railroads in this instance as merely another of the 'grand stand plays' to the people of which you are capable."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater broke out in a new place yesterday afternoon.  He informed the exposition board of directors that the World-Herald was printing too much news, and to support his assertion he produced a copy of the Sunday World-Herald and read aloud a part of the exclusive story about the meeting of the executive committee last Saturday, at which Directors Kountze, Murphy and Webster appeared and took him to task for his failure to advertise the exposition.</p>
                            <p>He said that it was an executive session, and that none of the proceedings were supposed to get out.  They had gotten out, and that was why Mr. Rosewater's grief receptacle sprung a leak.  It was not so much that news got out, but that news of that particular brand should reach the eye or ear of the public.  It was bad enough for three of the most prominent directors of the exposition to lay him across a barrel and fan the end of his spine with a spiked plank, but for the plain statement of fact to go out to the readers of the World-Herald was an insult that he could <choice><sic>no</sic><corr>not</corr></choice> brook.  That the directors might know how he felt about it, he stated that he "resented the outrage," and he gave them to understand that there was a great deal of difference between being outrager and outragee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ROSEY TURNS THE SPIGOT.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said that he had talked with most of the members of the committee and of the other directors who were present, and they had assured him that they did not give out the information.  He was therefore positive that the secretary had given out the fatal secret, and he proposed to dance Secretary Wakefield up and down.  He said that it was not the first time such a thing had happened, and that he "did not propose to have an employe of the exposition venting spleen" in any such way.</p>
                            <p>Warming up to his subject, Mr. Rosewater declared that the "tail had been wagging the dog long enough."  Then Mr. Rosewater swelled up until he almost filled his clothes, and shouted:  "I won't stand it.  I don't have to stand it.  I have a remedy and I will use it."</p>
                            <p>A director sought to smooth things over by remarking, "Perhaps the reporter was a mind reader."</p>
                            <p>"Mind reader," snorted the irate little gentleman, "he got his information from somebody on the inside.  Here it is about Dr. Miller being mentioned to go east, and all the rest of the talk that the committee had on the subject.  Dr. Miller wasn't there, and it is easy to see that inside information was given out.  The secretary was there all though the meeting, and that was how it got out."</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield asked to be allowed to make a statement, and was granted the opportunity.  He stated that he was not present at the conference, as he realized from the nature of things when the talk got started that it would take some time, and that he was excused in order to go to his office and attend to other pressing work.  He was absent about two hours, returning at the end of the conference.</p>
                            <p>"Well, what did you tell the World-Herald about it?" demanded Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WAKEFIELD'S REJOINDER.</head>
                            <p>The secretary stated that he had given the usual information regarding the routine work of the committee, denying to the reporter that anything else had occurred, although the latter had already heard of the row and insisted that other matters had transpired.  The secretary denied that he had entertained any spleen, and told Mr. Rosewater how much he admired him.</p>
                            <p>"I have always admired your capability, Mr. Rosewater," said the secretary, "and I have told you that I admired you.  I am not two-faced.</p>
                            <p>"It's about time you told it to somebody else," snarled Mr. Rosewater, and he refused to be comforted.  He then brought up the meeting at which the Blackburn pass matter had been a bone of contention, when he was turned down.  "That all got into the World-Herald in the same way.  Of course, the imaginative reporter got that out of his mind, too, if this story is to be believed.  Now, I know better, and I tell you again I won't stand it."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater stopped to take breath, and the president seized the opportunity to say that the secretary's explanation had been heard and the board would proceed to other business.</p>
                            <p>The first matter before the meeting was the resolution that was under consideration at the former meeting, directing the bureau of admissions to send out passes to the country editors as had been previously ordered.  Mr. Rosewater had declined to follow instructions, and had then refused to continue as press pass dispenser unless the former action was rescinded.  This was the state of affairs under which Mr. Hitchcock offered the resolution directing the bureau of admissions to execute the board's order.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">IDOL OF ALL EDITORS.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater was called on to explain what he meant by refusing to carry out the board's decree.  He repeated a number of the statements previously made, and then switched off to tell how popular he was with the country press.  He said he had in years gone by been a good deal of an anti-monopolist, and the country editors swore by him.  He insisted that when the pass matter was first under consideration he was the identical individual who had secured a thirty-day pass for the country publishers, instead of a five day pass.</p>
                            <p>The other members of the executive committee heard the statement in open-mouthed astonishment, and looked wonderingly at each other and then at Mr. Rosewater.  The latter, however, seemed to believe in himself for the time being, and hurried on to say that he had laid down his duties for one day by turning them over to the president, "who quickly found out what a burden it was, and was glad to get him to take it back."</p>
                            <p>"Why, I had no authority to do anything in the matter," remonstrated the president.</p>
                            <p>"I gave you authority, didn't I, when I turned the work over to you?"</p>
                            <p>"Neither the board nor committee authorized me to issue passes in your department."</p>
                            <p>"Good G-d, if you want authority we'll give it to you," snapped the now thoroughly aroused manager of the department of publicity and promotion.  "There is no such record of ingratitude anywhere as this board had shown to me.  I have given an amount of space to this exposition that would foot up to more than as this board has shown to me.  I have put in more time personally than any other director.  I say it is the greatest piece of ingratitude ever recorded, and when my life work is ended and the record is written, people will be ashamed of it."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater was so busy working the tremulo stop in his thorax that he allowed his language to become somewhat ambiguous, and when he gently pressed his anatomy into his chair the directors were a little at sea as to whether people were to be ashamed of Rosewater's record or of ingratitude on the part of some person or persons unknown.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery said he thought that an improper motive had been behind the whole proceeding, and that Mr. Hitchcock had been influenced more by personal feelings against Mr. Rosewater than by what was for the best interests of the exposition.  He thought discretion must be left with the manager of the department or somebody else, and discussed the proposition as if the resolution did not provide for that discretion in so many words.</p>

                            <p>The motion was lost on viva voce vote, leaving the situation just where it was before.  The instructions to send out the passes are in effect, Mr. Rosewater declines to abide by them, and when last heard from on the subject said he would not act further unless the orders were rescinded.  According to the record they have not been rescinded.</p>
                            <p>Clement Chase, editor of the Excelsior, sent in a communication returning a short term pass, protesting against the treatment by Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery moved that a season pass be issued.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater immediately bobbed up with a remonstrance, remarking, "then where does the discretion come in?"</p>
                            <p>"Well, we reserve the right to revise the discretion," was the reply.</p>
                            <p>"Then there will be no end to this thing," protested Mr. Rosewater.  "There is no law of the Medes and Persians requiring that this man should have a pass."</p>
                            <p>But the directors thought otherwise, and so expressed themselves, though they did it in the shape of Mr. Wharton's amendment, which tried to let the sore person down easily, and referred the matter back to the department of publicity and promotion "with a statement that it was the sense of the board that the pass be requested."</p>
                            <p>Both Directors Montgomery and Weller commended the work of the Excelsior, and stated plainly that there was no proper reason why the passes should have been refused in the first place.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MR. HITCHCOCK'S LETTER.</head>
                            <p>Denver, Colo., Aug. 13.&#8212;To the Board of Directors, Trans-Mississippi Exposition&#8212;Gentlemen:  Not being able to attend Monday's meeting, I venture to send this communication.</p>
                            <p>Every day evidence multiplies showing that people in the east are almost without knowledge of our exposition.  Manderson writes that few Boston people know of the existence of the show.  Thursday, the R. G. Dun agency in Omaha received a letter from its Philadelphia office, asking on behalf of a Philadelphia manufacturer, whether the "Nebraska Interstate fair" had "opened yet."  Friday I received a letter from a Chicago friend now in the east, quoting a conversation he had had with the editor of the New York Evening Post, in which the editor said he rarely heard or read anything about the exposition and expressing surprise that, if it was really as fine as my friend stated, some effort had not been made to make it known in the east.</p>
                            <p>I cite these three letters because they are the last to come.  All others tell the same story.  Every Omaha man who goes east discovers the same condition&#8212;ignorance of our exposition.</p>
                            <p>We thought the exposition would advertise Omaha.  To get visitors from the east in large numbers was one hope; another was to make Omaha favorably known in the east, even to those who could not be attracted as visitors.</p>
                            <p>Up to date we have failed miserably.  The situation would be ludicrous if it were not so serious.  Those in the east who speak of the exposition call it a Nebraska fair and confuse it with the Sioux City Corn Palace.  That little Corn Palace was better known in the east before it was finished than our great, beautiful exposition is today.  Yet we have been actively at work for nearly two years.  Our publicity and promotion department has expended $65,000.  The net result is indifference and ignorance among the eastern papers and an almost unfriendly feeling among the 3,000 newspapers published within 400 miles of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>To cure this last I beg to suggest that the directory enforce its order that season passes be sent to the weekly papers of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming and Kansas, and five other nearby states should also be included.</p>
                            <p>I also suggest that we make an effort, even at this late day, to attract attention in the east.  It is too late to use posters, except near to Omaha, and too expensive to use them in large cities.  Buffalo Bill used 55,000 sheets on Chicago bill boards.  We made a feeble effort with less than 2,000 in that city.  This comparison illustrates the hopeless task of billing big cities.  We must use the big newspapers.  We ought to get entrance to their columns free of charge.  We could and would if they knew what the exposition is.</p>
                            <p>Send each one of the big eastern papers a complete collection of Rinehart's beautiful photographs.  If necessary, send each paper fifty different views.  They need not be mounted.  They should be sent by express and with them literature and a letter.  The letter should be short; it should ask for recognition of the exposition; tell of its size, cost and attendance.  It should invite the editor to come to Omaha as our guest.</p>
                            <p>This package of pictures would be turned over to the art departments of many of the newspapers and would appear in Sunday editions of those newspapers&#8212;not to oblige us, but because:</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;The photographs prove the size and beauty of the show.</p>
                            <p>Second&#8212;Because people in the east know nothing about it and papers are always looking for Sunday features on subjects that their readers "know nothing about."</p>
                            <p>This letter is a suggestion, written because several directors have asked me the question:  "What can we do?"  Much more ought to be done, but this letter would be too long if not stopped here.  Yours truly,</p>

                            <p>Mr. Rosewater forgot his former troubles in the face of this new one.  "Well," he declared, "this man has a superabundance of gall.  As for R. G. Dun's man, he ought to be dismissed from their employ if he don't know that the exposition has been extensively advertised in Philadelphia.  A Pennsylvania commission was appointed a couple of weeks ago and the Philadelphia papers had a half column about it.  Here are some pictures that the Scientific American is going to run next week, and they are the best that have been turned out.  These dancers in the Streets of All Nations are so clear that I can recognize every one of them.  This man Hitchcock don't want to know.  That's what's the matter with him."</p>
                            <p>Then Mr. Rosewater proceeded to prove that the editor of the Post knew all about the exposition because he was present at an Associated Press banquet when Mr. Rosewater stood up and talked on that subject, "and two waiters held a big picture of the exposition up behind my back so that they would know what I was talking about."  Mr. Rosewater did not quite make it clear just how much good his talk did the exposition, when it was so incoherent that it required an illustration to enable the auditors to determine what he was talking about, but he left that part of it and told how John Brisbane Walker was coming here to see the exposition later in the season if his mother got well.  This demonstrated satisfactorily to Mr. Rosewater's mind that the show was splendidly advertised, and with another reference to Mr. Walker and the prospects of his mother getting well Mr. Rosewater concluded.</p>
                            <p>President Walker stated that he thought satisfactory arrangements would be reached, in accordance with a recent conference, as a resolution had been adopted that it was thought would cover the ground.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Webster put in a peg and stopped the attempted stampede.</p>

                            <p>He said he desired to state that certain directors had conferred with the executive committee and he wanted the directors to know about it.  They had come to the conclusion that the <choice><sic>exposiion</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice> needed a great deal more advertising than it had been getting, and it had been deemed best to send Dr. George L. Miller through the east to see what could be done toward getting exposition cuts and news in the big papers of the eastern cities.  It had also been suggested that Mr. <choice><sic>Roseawter</sic><corr>Rosewater</corr></choice> accompany Dr. Miller to the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, but it was contemplated that Dr. Miller would travel all through the east, and personally take charge of the situation.  It was also proposed to send out men on all the railroads within 500 miles of Omaha and have them personally see to the placing of posters and bills.  He said the committee thought this sufficient to meet the conditions and put a stop to the general complaint about insufficient advertising.</p>
                            <p>Inasmuch as the cat was out of the bag and the board had been advised of the full facts regarding the <choice><sic>actionof</sic><corr>action of</corr></choice> the secret conference, when Mr. Rosewater was hauled over the coals and the matter of eastern advertising placed in the hands of Dr. Miller, the president then brought out the resolutions and read them, admitting in response to Mr. Webster's inquiry that they had not been adopted, but that "he understood that they would be."  This did not satisfy the directors, and they proceeded to pass the resolutions themselves, so that they stand as the declared purpose of the big board.  Dr. Miller will go east as the representative of the board of directors and attempt to secure the publication of the facts regarding the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A petition from the Christian Endeavor society asking for the closing of the exposition on Sunday was filed.</p>

                            <p>Chairman Kilpatrick of the investigating committee made a partial report in two sections.  The first approved of the action of the executive committee with reference to secret societies, and the second was a vigorous denunciation of the concessions and exhibits departments for their action in throwing "Mogy" Bernstein's boot-blacking <choice><sic>furnitlure</sic><corr>furniture</corr></choice> out of the buildings at the opening of the exposition.  It denounced the action as arbitrary, unjust and illegal, and recommended the payment of money to Bernstein in settlement.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery made an onslaught on the committee, and said it had exceeded its authority.  He said it had no right to look over the acts of the executive committee, but was simply to detect thievery if it could.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton in turn jumped on Mr. Montgomery and declared that the committee was going to investigate all charges of imposition, if it investigated anything, and that Mr. Montgomery had no right as the representative of honest men to make such statements.  He said the exposition was not a band of robbers.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery did not seem to coincide with Mr. Wharton, but he did not invite a second collision with the buzz saw.</p>
                            <p>The report was laid over to await the return of Mr. Reed, who is an interested party under its terms, and an adjournment was taken until Friday afternoon.</p>

                            <p>The wheelmen's parade did not materialize last night.  Through bungling management on the grounds the wheelmen bumped up against so many disagreeable features that they quit in disgust.  In the first place they were not allowed to take their wheels into the grounds during the forenoon, but had to check them outside.  This necessitated going out after them later to take part in the evening parade, and an additional admission fee of 50 cents.  They declined to pay $1 for the privilege of parading, and hundreds of them immediately turned back down town.  Those who went met with a continuation of the wretched arrangements, and by the time 7 o'clock rolled around they were so mad that they wouldn't have paraded if they had been paid for it.  There was no excuse for the wretched botch.  It was simply a case of stupid blundering, similar to that which kept the St. Joseph tally-hos standing outside the grounds while the representatives of various departments quarreled over who should waive the rule and admit visitors through the carriage gate.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Foster of the buildings and grounds department yesterday moved his quarters from the cottage on the bluff tract to the Service building.</p>
                            <p>Captain Mercer locked horns with the management again yesterday and had to threaten to close up the camp in order to gain the necessary concession.  The hitch arose over the ice furnished the camp.  The quality was bad and when it got worse Mercer kicked.  He changed icemen, but the exposition stopped it, refusing to allow the new one to come through the gate.  Mercer was to be forced to patronize the concern in which one of the exposition moguls was interested or go without ice.  The mogul didn't know Mercer.  He knows him now.  There is a new ice man in camp, and the Mercer banner still floats aloft.</p>

Mr. McConnell consented and at 9 o'clock the following negroes went over:  Lizzie Sherville, female basso; Jim Johnson, Sam Scott and Henry Knight, burlesque bone and barber artists; the Pickininny quartet and others.  The entertainment lasted from 9:30 to 10:30 and the 850 members and guests declared they had never witnessed a performance so unique and interesting.  The negroes from the Old Plantation receive invitations every day to appear at some sociable or entertainment.</p>

                            <p>The Denver Wheel club will not come to Omaha to participate in Wheelmen's day at the exposition, because of unreasonable railroad rates.</p>
                            <p>Missouri day at the exposition has been declared off because of unreasonable railroad rates.</p>
                            <p>Recently Omaha lost the stenographers' convention because of unreasonable railroad rates.</p>
                            <p>The exposition period is half completed and yet, at this late day, Omaha finds itself losing important gatherings because of unreasonable railroad rates.</p>
                            <p>The question is:  How much longer will the people of Omaha tolerate this outrageous imposition?</p>
                            <p>Whenever the railroads have a piece of anti-corporation legislation to defeat the railroad managers call upon the people of Omaha to help them, and in the past they have never called in vain.</p>
                            <p>Whenever the railroads have a man of putty whom they want to elect to the office of governor they call upon the people of Omaha for votes, and they have seldom called in vain.</p>
                            <p>For twenty years Omaha was disgraced and humiliated by a cowshed which took the place that should have been occupied fifteen years ago by a splendid union depot, and this disgrace was not wiped out until the people of this city united for an organized demand for their rights.</p>
                            <p>More than four months ago the president of the Union Pacific asked permission for that company to erect a cowshed to be used as a depot, promising at the time that within thirty days his company would begin the construction of a magnificent depot, which would be completed before snow came.  That cowshed continues to serve as a depot, no movement has been made to carry out that explicit promise, and now the people of Omaha are informed that negotiations are in progress for the Union Pacific to use the depot erected by the Burlington.</p>
                            <p>Imposed upon and insulted by the railroad corporations in every matter of vital interest to Omaha, the people of this city may well feel humiliated at the situation with which they are confronted.  It is an insufferable situation and the only permanent and effective remedy is for this city to cease being used as a catspaw for the corporations.</p>
                            <p>Omaha people should have learned by this time that it is not to their interests to pull corporation chestnuts out of the fire.  In spite of all the favors that Omaha people have bestowed upon these corporations Omaha is today, as Nebraska was up to two years ago, the worst corporation-ridden community in the United States.  If the people of Omaha would quit voting the corporation ticket, would refuse to oppose measures that seek to compel exact justice at the corporations' hands, and would fearlessly demand their rights from these corporations, the interests of Omaha would be largely advanced.</p>
                            <p>Railroad managers have always felt that they could depend upon Omaha to oppose measures which were not to the railroads' <choice><sic>intersts</sic><corr>interests</corr></choice> and to favor measures favored by the railroads.  And although this dependence has seldom been in vain there is not a city in the United States one-half the size of Omaha that the railroads would dare to impose upon, to insult and to humiliate to the extent that Omaha has been imposed upon, insulted and humiliated during all the time it has patiently courted corporation favor.</p>
                            <p>The city that patiently submits to the imposition under which Omaha suffers can never hope to improve its natural opportunities.</p>
                            <p>The time has come when the people of this city should demand and require at the hands of the railroads reasonable passenger <choice><sic>ates</sic><corr>rates</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>If these rates are not granted during the present week the World-Herald proposes that the people of Omaha shall organize for determined action.  If Omaha has not sufficient influence to induce the railroad companies to deal fairly with it in the matter of passenger rates the people of Omaha have the power to require the railroad companies to build a system of viaducts, to place a watchman at every intersection crossed by railroad tracks, to provide electric lights at every intersection, and to do many other things essential to the public safety which the railroads heretofore have neglected to do and which duty the generosity of this people has permitted them to avoid.</p>
                            <p>If the railroads will not deal justly with Omaha in the matter of passenger rates the people of this city can line up in the championship of a 2-cent fare passenger rate established by law as a maximum in Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>If the railroads will not deal justly with Omaha in the matter of passenger rates the people of this city have it in their power to retaliate, and in the opinion of the World-Herald the moment for the commencement of this work of retaliation is very rapidly approaching.</p>
                            <p>If during the next five days the railroad managers do not do justice to Omaha in this respect the World-Herald now serves notice that it will endeavor to lead a crusade in this city that will result in the railroads <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Omaha has pleaded too long for justice at the hands of these corporations.</p>
                            <p>Let it be understood here and now that Omaha pleads no longer; that it entreats no more.</p>
                            <p>Let it be known that Omaha demands exact justice and will employ every means within its power to enforce its demands.</p>

                            <p>The Denver Wheel club did not take part in Wheelmen's day.  The Denver is one of the crack clubs of the country, and contains many riders of national reputation.  The club numbers about 300 men, and is a strong organization.  Arrangements had been made for 150 members of this club to take part in Wheelmen's day, but yesterday morning D. J. O'Brien of this city, chief consul League of American Wheelmen for Nebraska, announced that they would not be here.  The club had engaged quarters at the Dellone for 150 people, but the date has been canceled.</p>
                            <p>In the notice from Denver to the managers at Omaha the statement is emphatically made that railroad rates were unreasonable and so unsatisfactory that the club had voted not to come.  Just what rate was made the Denver people is not positively known, but it is intimated that it was over one fare for each person and extra strong for wheels, and a very brief limit to tickets&#8212;giving the party no opportunity to see the exposition or have a good time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">May Reconsider It, but Fares Are Too High Yet&#8212;15,000 to 20,000 People Depended on It.</head>
                            <p>A telegram sent out from St. Louis announced that Missouri day at the exposition had been declared off on account of failure to secure rates to Omaha.  President Sterrett of the Missouri commission had labored to secure a reasonable rate for August 20, Missouri day, and failing to get a better rate than one fare for the round trip from all points in Missouri to Omaha, gave up the matter and wrote to Omaha declaring Missouri day indefinitely postponed.</p>
                            <p>Since that time the exposition management has been at work, and President Wattles of the exposition said yesterday that he was sure Missouri day would go on as advertised, and that President Sterrett had wired him that he would be here.</p>
                            <p>"We have received," said President Wattles, "a rate of 1 cent a mile for that day, and believe when Mr. Sterrett comes he will reconsider the matter."</p>
                            <p>It is understood, however, that President Sterrett demanded a better rate than 1 cent a mile, and felt assured with a better rate he could land 15,000 or 20,000 Missourians in Omaha on the 19th and 20th.  Just what President Sterrett will do about the 1 cent a mile rate remains to be seen, but at this writing Missouri day is declared off&#8212;postponed until a rate is secured that will enable people living in the northeast, southeast and southwest part of the state to come to Omaha without selling a farm or two.  President Sterrett expressed himself as in favor of having no Missouri day at all unless one could be had that was a credit to the state and the exposition, and he is ambitious to have at least 20,000 Missourians here on Missouri day, and thanks anything short of that will not be a credit to the state.</p>

Gwinn, chairman of the Idaho exposition commission is here on his way home from the east where he attended the meeting of the Two Hundred Thousand Dollar Insurance Writers' club.  While here he and Mr. Driscoll will consult about the arrangement of the Idaho fruit display.  Mayor Alexander of Boise arrived in the city last evening and will be shown over the exposition.  Mr. Gwinn says that the exposition is a much grander affair than most people have any idea of.</p>
                            <p>Several hundred of the children excursionists Friday lined up in front of the Nebraska fruit display and gave three cheers for it.</p>
                            <p>The California exhibit has been freshened by the addition of Satsuma, silver and Burbank plums and Valencia late oranges.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday's trains brought in more people than at any time since opening day of the exposition.  Upwards of 2,000 arrived at the union and Burlington depots, while possible one-half that number came in at the Webster street depot and hundreds who left the eastern trains across the river came over on the street cars.  All were bound for the exposition.  Although it is what it termed "blue Monday" in railroad circles, and although there were no special rates offered the people came in crowds from adjacent towns and the street cars were kept busy transferring them to the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The Burlington brought in two extra cars of Independent Order of Foresters from Wilbur.</p>

                            <p>William J. Stewart, secretary of the National Florists' association, arrived in the city yesterday, and is at the Mercer.  When asked as to what attendance was anticipated at the fourteenth annual meeting of that association, which convenes in this city today.  Mr. Stewart said:  "We usually have 700 to 1,000 delegates in attendance, and had about 800 last year, but we will not have here to exceed one-third of the number present last year.  If we have 250 people present I shall not feel discouraged.  Rates are so high coming westward that eastern people cannot come.  The delegation from the east will be small."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The regular exposition routine was varied this forenoon by the arrival of Governor Culberson and his party of Texans and the first session of the Congress of White and Colored Americans in the Auditorium.  Governor Culberson and his party came out quite informally and were met by General Manager Clarkson and escorted to the principal points of interest about the grounds.  Tomorrow they will formally celebrate the participation of the Lone Star state in the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>The arrival of the delegates to the white and colored congress was attended by some confusion on account of a misunderstanding between the local committee and the exposition management.  The committee had located the session in the Auditorium in spite of the express notification from General Manager Clarkson that it would be necessary to pay admission into the grounds in order to reach the building.  At the hour at which the congress was called there were a large number of delegates outside the Sherman Avenue gates who had come under the impression that they were to be passed into the grounds.  A committee was sent to General Manager Clarkson, who returned with Superintendent Foster, and finally adjusted the difficulty by locking all the doors of the Auditorium but one, and letting in the crowd through the wagon <choice><sic>gatae</sic><corr>gate</corr></choice>.  The exits to the grounds were then placed in charge of the guards, and those who wished to go in that direction were compelled to go outside and come in at the main entrance in the usual way.</p>
                            <p>The exercises opened with music, a chorus selected from the various colored church choirs of the city rendering the "Star Spangled Banner" with commendable precision.  An invocation by Rev. W. E. DeClayborn of Denver preceded an address by E. R. Overall of Omaha, who discussed the sentiment of the occasion and the objects of the congress.  He said that the highest prosperity of a country is only possible when the heartiest sympathy and good will exist between the people.  The differences of racial prejudice, in his opinion, are largely due to ignorance, which results in continued friction.  An interchange of views will be of incalculable benefit in promoting a better understanding between the races.  He deprecated the establishment of the color line in industrial occupations and contended for more effective protection for colored prisoners.  The colored American should now be assigned to a higher place before the world than he occupied at the time of his emancipation.  He had deserved this by his advancement in education and industry and his well established loyalty to American institutions.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant Governor J. E. Harris extended a welcome in behalf of the state government.  He said that no class of American citizens has more reason to be loyal to the flag than the colored race.  All Americans are facing a great responsibility at this time, in which white and colored people should meet on the common ground of manhood.  The colored people excel in oratory, music and religious instincts.  Let it take care to be manly and pure and honest, and God will take care of the rest.</p>
                            <p>H. S. Howell of Kansas City responded in behalf of the congress, and declared that the time is fast approaching when the world will place its stamp of approval on manhood and womanhood, and the man who has demonstrated his power and ability will be given his proper place regardless of the color of his skin.  The colored man should not be contented to work out his destiny with a pick and shovel.  Wherever brains or skill is wanted he should make his way.  If he cannot succeed in this country he cannot succeed anywhere.  Thirty years ago scarcely a colored man in the south could read.  Now colored lawyers and physicians and statesmen are assisting to work out the problem of their race to a successful issue.</p>
                            <p>After another selection by the chorus, Mayor Moores was introduced to welcome the congress to the city of Omaha.  He declared that since it had been invested with the panoply of citizenship the course of the colored race has been steadily upward and onward.  A progress that would be remarkable as the product of a century had marked the last forty years.  The courage and daring of the colored soldier had been indicated at Santiago, where they have shown that they are as good soldiers on the battlefield as on the parade ground.  He expressed the hope that the day will soon come when no man, white or black, will be punished for a crime until he has been convicted by a jury of his peers.  In closing he extended to the delegates the freedom of the city and assured them of his deep interest in their deliberations.</p>
                            <p>W. E. Gladner of Colorado responded briefly to the sentiments of the preceding speaker, in the absence of J. G. Jones of Chicago, who had been expected to perform that office, and the remainder of the program consisted of music and recitations by delegates.  P. J. Lowery of Topeka contributed a very well rendered cornet solo and Miss Victoria E. Overall of Kansas City a recitation.  The song, "The Boys Who Wore the Blue Are Turning Gray," was rendered by a quartet and was received with hearty approval.</p>

At McFarland, Kan., yesterday noon the party was tendered an extended complimentary dinner by the Rock Island railroad.  The details of the excursion were in the hands of Assistant Passenger Agent R.

                            <p>Yesterday was even too warm for the Indians and while none of them succumbed to the intense heat they did not venture out into the sporting lot to indulge in the customary dances.  An Assiniboine dance was scheduled for the afternoon, but when old Hits-the-Eagle-in-the-Wing looked out of his tepee and discovered that the mercury was near the century mark he concluded that lying in the shade was preferable to skipping around in the rays of an August sun and so informed his braves.  A few of the young Indians got out in the shade of the trees and indulged in shooting arrows for the pennies of the white man, but even this was an effort and the youngsters did not enter into the spirit of the sport.  In the evening a friendly dance was put on, but even this did not draw the strength of the encampment.</p>
                            <p>Additional delegations are looked for daily and if nothing happens a party of Crows ought to be here today, as they left their agency last week.</p>
                            <p>Captain Mercer has made arrangements by which he will secure a large number of ponies that will be here in time for the next sham battle, which will be fought between Indians some time during the next two weeks.</p>
                            <p>Since the departure of the Flandreau Cornet band there has been a dearth of music at the Indian encampment.  This is not likely to continue long, as it is probable that the band from the Genoa Indian school will be brought here for an extended engagement.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sets Up a Carload of Melons for the Crowd to Eat.</head>
                            <p>The Oklahoma people made a great hit yesterday and their exhibit in the Agricultural building was the great drawing card during the afternoon.  Exposition Commissioner St. Clair arrived early in the morning and with him came a car of watermelons, the greater portion of which were carted to the grounds and corded up around the booth.  Then the word was passed along the line that the carving of the fruit would being at 4 o'clock and continue as long as there was a melon in sight.  Long before 4 o'clock the Agricultural building was <choice><sic>beseiged</sic><corr>besieged</corr></choice> by an army of men, women and children.  The guard force at the doors was doubled and people were passed inside until they filled the aisles and all of the vacant space in and about the exhibits.</p>
                            <p>Promptly at 4 o'clock all of the people connected with the Oklahoma exhibit lined up in front of the pile of great, <choice><sic>lucious</sic><corr>luscious</corr></choice> melons, knives in hand.  Commissioner St. Clair called time and gave the order to begin cutting.  During the next hour everybody ate watermelon and went away satisfied.  Great chunks of the rich red meat were passed out as fast as half a dozen men could handle their knives.  The melons were large ones and were all perfect.  One was sufficient to feed twenty people and as there were 100 melons cut and distributed it was figured that fully 2,000 persons enjoyed the hospitality of Oklahoma.</p>

                            <p>It is getting to be a great fad to visit the Douglas county exhibit in the Agricultural building at noontime.  There are a good many people who know just what to expect at that hour and consequently they have motives in being present.  Some days ago Superintendent Walsh, who is in charge of the Douglas county agricultural exhibit, introduced the custom of carving a melon promptly at nigh noon.  A few friends were invited and the news spread, not only through the building, but to other buildings on the grounds.  Since that time the Douglas county exhibit has been popular and every person who happens around at the lunch hour is certain of a slice of melon.</p>
                            <p>Each day adds to the magnitude of the exhibit made by Douglas county, as fresh vegetables are installed.  The latest things to find a place in the exhibit are of Chinese origin, but of Nebraska growth.  There are Chinese cucumbers that are from two to eight inches in length.  They are said to be good to eat, but as yet no white man has tried them.  They are of a bright green and in appearance resemble over-grown milk weed pods.  Then there are the Chinese melons and the Chinese squashes.  The former resemble great pears, while the latter are more like ripe cucumbers than like squashes.</p>
                            <p>People who visit the Agricultural building never tire of praising the exhibit made by Douglas county.  It is kept in first-class condition, which in a measure accounts for its popularity, yet there is much to be seen that cannot be found in the other exhibits.  A Hubbard squash is attracting as much attention just now as any one thing.  It is as big as the top of a pork barrel and weighs seventy-five pounds.  There are also some tomatoes that do not take a back seat for any other tomatoes on the grounds.  They are solid and meaty and several of them weigh eight pounds each.</p>

                            <p>Mrs. Caroline Shaw Brooks entertained the visitors at the Girls' and Boys' building by modeling in butter a relief bust of Lincoln.  The work was all done on the stage and in full view of the audience.  Working without the aid of refrigerating apparatus she had to hurry much more than in modeling the bust of Dewey, which she made in the refrigerating car in the Dairy building.  The execution, however, was fine and the features of the face were brought out clear and distinct.</p>
                            <p>The bust of Dewey that Mrs. Brooks made some weeks ago is still in the car in the Dairy building and appears to be as perfect as upon the day of its completion.  Shortly after the finishing touches were put on the temperature in the car was allowed to get too high and some of the admiral's features slid off.  In fact a part of his nose and an ear sloughed.  The temperature was run down and the missing features were put on again, since which time there has not been any more trouble of the kind.</p>
                            <p>In the near future and as soon as some more butter arrives Mrs. Shaw will make other models.  During the exposition she expects to make a bust of President McKinley and some of the officials of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Editors Collins of the Helena Independent and Fitzgerald of the Butte Miner arrived yesterday from Montana and will remain in the city several days, visiting the exposition.  Yesterday afternoon they spent the time at the state building and looking over the Montana exhibits in the main buildings.  They both expressed surprise at the magnitude of the exposition and declared that it exceeded their expectations.</p>
                            <p>Miss Plumer, an employe at the Casino restaurant, was severely cut by broken crockery yesterday afternoon.  She was carrying a tray of dishes when she caught her foot and fell, smashing the crockery into pieces.  One of the sharp edges gashed her right arm, severing the muscles to the bone and cutting the radial artery.  The wound bled profusely and the woman was nearly exhausted from loss of blood when she was taken to the hospital.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">WORK FOR THE AUDITING COMMITTEE.</hi></head>
                            <p>The exposition committee of audit and revision has, after considerable delay, entered upon the work for which it was chiefly created&#8212;namely, the examination and checking up of the books and accounts of the exposition.  This is a labor that should have been begun months ago.</p>
                            <p>It is a matter of notoriety that the whole machinery of collecting and disbursing the exposition funds has been and is still in the hands of one man.  The secretary, although a salaried employe, is an autocrat who dominates everything and everybody connected with the Ways and Means department.  While the corporation has a treasurer, all the functions of the treasurer have been performed and monopolized by the secretary.  The so-called auditor is merely the secretary's clerk, subject to his control and direction.  The bureau of admissions is a farce because the secretary is the bureau of admissions.  The secretary directs and controls the ticket sellers, gatekeepers and inspectors.  He manipulates at will the returns of the gate receipts and reports or suppresses reports about attendance at his own pleasure.</p>
                            <p>Under this extraordinary condition it is not surprising that directors and stockholders can get no intelligent or satisfactory exhibit of the financial affairs of the exposition and up to date have been unable to secure periodic reports showing the exact resources, obligations and current expenses.</p>
                            <p>It is no impeachment of the integrity of the secretary for the directors to insist on a revision by an expert of the accounts that have never been properly audited.  Everything may be found all right and every dollar properly accounted, but it is imperative that the books, vouchers receipts and bank accounts be thoroughly checked up and statements be prepared affording full and correct information as to the status of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Incidentally the committee of audit and revision should endeavor to devise improved methods of accounting and suggest better checks upon concessionaires and employes.  This task alone will tax the best energies of the committee.</p>

In seeking to curtail the authority of the investigating committee Mr. Montgomery undoubtedly understands his own motive, but the public will be at a loss to understand why the attorney for the exposition should be the first to protest against the investigating committee's initial report.</p>

                            <p>After reading the World-Herald's demand yesterday for decent treatment to Omaha from the railroads a high railroad official said:  "What does the World-Herald mean by that vicious attack on the railroads?  Does it not know that the people of Omaha can do nothing against the combined railroads?"</p>
                            <p>Perhaps Omaha is unable to accomplish anything in the face of combined opposition from the railroads, but we do not believe it.  Omaha has been content with taking what the railroads saw fit to offer and thanking them for it.  But Omaha is growing out of this foolish habit. Omaha is big enough now to make demands, and big enough to enforce them in a <choice><sic>measuse</sic><corr>measure</corr></choice>.  At any rate, Omaha is big enough to make trouble for the railroads that refuse to be decent in their treatment of this city.  The World-Herald disclaims any intent to make a vicious attack, or any other kind of an attack, upon the railroads.  The World-Herald disclaims any intent to make a vicious attack, or any other kind of an attack, upon the railroads.  The World-Herald merely intended to convey to the railroads the information that benefits are reciprocal between Omaha and the railroads&#8212;or will be as soon as Omaha citizens quit the foolish practice of allowing an annual pass in the hands of a few merchants keep them divided upon the question of forcing the railroads to be fair with the city.  Just because Omaha was kind enough to put up with a cowshed passenger station for twenty years is no sign that Omaha will put up with every species of rank injustice from the same source that kept the cowshed in place.  When it comes to combining Omaha citizens can do a little in that line.  If the combined railroads want a fight with the combined citizenship of Omaha they can, the World-Herald believes, get it in almighty short order.  The people of Omaha who have worked so hard and sacrificed so much to make the exposition a success are thoroughly aroused against the injustice being done them by the railroads in the matter of exposition rates.  If they continue in their present frame of mind they may become aroused on other matters.  They may be aroused to the point of demanding a few more steel viaducts.  They may be aroused to the point <choice><sic>or</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> demanding a flagman at every grade crossing.  They may be aroused to the point of insisting upon the railroads providing an electric light at every street crossing.</p>
                            <p>If the railroads continue their policy of discriminating against Omaha the people of Omaha may be aroused to the point of heading a crusade for a law establishing a 2-cent passenger fare in Nebraska.  The price of other things has come down&#8212;why not the regular passenger fare?</p>
                            <p>Do the "combined railroads" want to tote fair with Omaha, or do they want to continue their policy of demanding everything and giving nothing?  The people of Omaha are at the point of insisting upon an answer to this <choice><sic>questoin</sic><corr>question</corr></choice>.  And they are about ready to accept the issue.  They will get ready if the railroads do not act during the present week.  The leaven of common sense is working.  The disposition to beg and plead is giving way to a determination to demand and enforce the demand.</p>
                            <p>What will the "combined railroads" do against the combined citizenship of Omaha?  What will they gain by arousing the animosity of Omaha?  What the railroads centering in Omaha need right now is more of common sense and less of autocracy.</p>

                            <head type="sub">From the Southwest With Straw Hats and Crash Suits the Southerners Visit Us.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Members of the Staff and Well Known Newspaper Men With the Executive--Their Day to Be a Great One.</head>
                            <p>It was a distinguished band of Texans that arrived in the city a few minutes after 12 o'clock last night on a special train over the Rock Island.  They formed the advance guard of a vast pilgrimage which will make Texas day, August 18, celebrated in the annals of the exposition.  The party was made up of the governor's chosen guests from every nook and corner of Texas and they are all gentlemen of distinction.</p>
                            <p>Immediately upon arriving the governor and his guests took carriages and were driven to the Murray hotel, where they registered.  As they stood in the lobby it was apparent that they had come from a sunny clime.  For the most part they wore straw hats of light woof, with wide, turned-up brims, crash suits and tan shoes.</p>
                            <p>The governor looked cool in his coat of black alpaca.  Around the governor were grouped ex-Governor F. R. Lubbock, ex-Governor R. B, Hubbard, and several newspaper men of note, among whom was the genial and irrepressible Bill Sterrett, who can tell a story better than any man within the borders of the Lone Star state.</p>
                            <p>Governor Culberson is a man of few words.  Texas swears by him, as they swore by his father, Judge Culberson, who was a famous man in his day and who was called upon by a republican administration to codify the laws of the state because of his acknowledged pre-eminence as a master of jurisprudence.  Governor Culberson declined to be interviewed and admitted that he disliked the ordeal.</p>
                            <p>"I do not love to talk to newspaper men," he said.  Nevertheless he had with him some of the best known newspaper men of his own state with him.  There were Mr. G. J. Palmer, business manager of the Houston Post; William Sterrett, Washington correspondent of the Galveston-Dallas News; Frank H. Bushick of the San Antonio Express and Tom Richardson of Houston, who is secretary of the Business Men's league of that city and one of the Texas commissioners.</p>
                            <p>Among other things which the Texans desired to impress upon the inquirer was the fact that the governor is to be their next senator.  Already over half of the legislators have declared their intention of voting to elevate him to that honorable position.</p>
                            <p>Among others of the governor's guests are:  Comptroller R. W. Finley, Austin; Hon. F. Pendexter, city attorney, Austin; Hon. F. P. Holland, Dallas; Dr. B. M. Worsham, Waxahacie; Prof. R. L. Batts of the state university, W. A. Childress, Houston; R. U. Culberson, brother of the governor, San Antonio; Hon. F. P. Holland, ex-mayor of Dallas; Gus F. Tayor, Tyler; R. E. Smith, Sherman; L. A. Carlton, Hillsboro; L. S. Flatau, Dallas; J. S. Myrick, Austin; William Wolf, Austin.</p>
                            <p>The following members of the governor's staff were also of the party: General A. P. Wozencraft, Dallas; Colonel J. D. Rudd, Waskom; Colonel B. F. Serill, Jefferson; Colonel R. J. Murphy, Paris; Colonel W. B. Henderson, Dallas; Colonel I. M. Standifer, Denison; Colonel L. J. Polk, Galveston; Colonel S. E. Moss, Cleburne.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Endeavors to Shut Off the Proposed Investigation.</head>
                            <p>A question that the board of directors will have to pass on at an early meeting is with reference to what is expected of the investigating committee.  The matter was brought up by Mr. Montgomery at Monday's meeting, but action went over with the report, to await the presence of Manager Reed.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="73" xml:id="TMISB06-073"/>
                            
                            <p>It was manifest at the time the committee was appointed that there was an active sentiment on the part of certain officials against an investigation, and the most demonstrative was General Consul Montgomery.  It had been talked considerably in exposition circles prior to that time that Mr. Montgomery's professional advice to the executive committee was surprisingly in accord with the interests of individual clients other than the exposition, and his objection to an investigation did not occasion much surprise.  Neither was much surprise manifested a little later on when Mr. Montgomery appeared as the defender of an employe of the exposition against whom nearly all the charges made had been directed.</p>
                            <p>There is surprise, however, on the part of several of the directors that Mr. Montgomery should now endeavor to throttle further investigation and prevent the committee reviewing some of the proceedings indulged in toward concessionaires and reporting the facts to the board of directors.  The matter was considerably discussed in official quarters yesterday, and the sentiment expressed was in favor of going to the bottom of things.  When Mr. Montgomery asked on Monday that parties be named against whom improper conduct was alleged, Mr. Wharton promised in very significant language to give Mr. Montgomery all the names he wanted later on, and all the facts connected with them, and the directors are looking forward to the further report of the investigating committee with much interest.</p>
                            <p>The members of the investigating committee stated in plain terms that they proposed to proceed as they had started out, or to give up the investigation entirely, and in that position the members of the directory seem to be nearly a unit.  They indorse the sentiment expressed by Mr. Wharton to the effect that the directors as reputable business men, who expect to remain here after the exposition is over, cannot afford to countenance the misconduct of fly-by-night employes, nor tolerate the continuance of a reign of persecution, favoritism and injustice, no matter whether it has the indorsement and protection of the general counsel of the exposition or not.  So strong were the expressions on the subject yesterday that it may be accepted as conclusive that Mr. Montgomery will stand practically alone in his attempt to head off the investigation, even if he does not follow his former course and hedge on the subject when he sees sentiment unanimously against him.</p>
                            <p>Miss Amelia Plumer, a restaurant employe on the grounds, fell yesterday with a tray of dishes and received several cuts from the broken ware, one piece severing an artery in the wrist.  She was taken to the hospital in the ambulance and later removed to her home.</p>
                            <p>John Brush, an Indian, who participates in the horse races at the Indian camp, was thrown from his horse yesterday, and the animal stepped on his hand, nearly tearing the little finger from its place.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday's paid admissions numbered 9,820.</p>
                            <p>The total admissions up to date, covering the first half of the exposition period, have been 839,637, of which 496,164 have been paid.</p>

                            <p>Manager Lindsey of the department of ways and means, who is incidentally the head of the musical branch, is sitting up nights trying to prevent a row in the bureau of music from coming to the surface.  The parties who are at loggerheads are T. J. Kelly, superintendent of the bureau, and Miss Julia Officer, manager of artists.  The friction is caused by an inability to determine who is "it."  Superintendent Kelly insists that as the official in charge he should be consulted with reference to engagements of individuals and the arrangement of special features, while Miss Officer holds that in the pursuit of the commissions that she is authorized to collect she ought to have full swing in the matter of engagements and collections.</p>
                            <p>Between the two fires Manager Lindsey is kept walking the floor with the baby.  While Mr. Kelly wants to put on spectacular and popular features in the Auditorium during the cool October evenings, Miss Officer insists on arranging for a <choice><sic>seacon</sic><corr>season</corr></choice> of grand opera, requiring a number of special "artists" and, incidentally, commissions.  When Mr. Kelly wanted to put on a popular concert for this evening Miss Officer walked Manager Lindsey into a corner and <choice><sic>aranged</sic><corr>arranged</corr></choice> for a concert of "artists," with a tenor from New York, a soprano from Chicago and an imported pianist.  When Mr. Kelly arranged for the opening of the Auditorium organ by Mr. Harrison Wild of Chicago Miss Officer interposed an objection and caused the announcement of a postponement to be made because her commission from Mr. Wild had not been arranged.  Subsequently the commission matter was arranged and the opening then was allowed to come off as advertised in the first place.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">CHORUS BACKS UP KELLY.</head>
                            <p>For this evening's concert Miss Officer had the announcement made that the exposition chorus would take part.  It so happens that Mr. Kelly is conductor of the chorus, and his associates in that organization, who have evinced considerable feeling over the situation, promptly declined to have anything to do with it.  They say that they are rehearsing hard for a number of concerts to be given later, and this occasion is therefore passed up with thanks.</p>
                            <p>There was a little talk of compulsion, and that the chorus would find its passes taken up unless the members responded, but they immediately sent back word that their passes would gladly be surrendered whenever desired, as they were doing $1 worth of work for the exposition for every cent's worth of benefit they received from the passes.</p>
                            <p>Since Kelly's installation as head of the musical department every effort has been made to popularize that feature, and its success has been manifested by the increased crowds at the concerts, and by the increased receipts at the gate when this feature was given full sway.  The question now seems to be whether this system shall be continued or supplant it by a return to the conspicuous "frosts" that characterized the early attempts to feature classical music against the exposition itself, and, secondarily, whether the <choice><sic>principay</sic><corr>principal</corr></choice> object of the music department is to furnish entertainment for exposition visitors or to provide commissions for persons whom the executive committee are not disposed to place on the pay roll.</p>
                            <p>When the question of sending passes to the country editors has been under consideration before the board of directors at various times the statement has been made that the passes had been generally sent out, and the impression has been created that nearly all of those entitled to passes had received them.  The fact is widely at variance with this idea, as up to the present time but 1,216 season passes have been issued to papers since the board ordered them sent out early in July.  This number represents but 718 papers, as in a great many cases the passes have been sent to both editor and wife, so that while the board ordered them sent to both editor and wife, so that while the board ordered them sent to all of the 3,100 papers in this and adjoining states that are in good standing barely one-fourth of them have received them.</p>
                            <p>The records prove a similar inaccuracy in Mr. Rosewater's statement last Monday to the effect that over 500 contracts had been signed by papers on the basis proposed by him as a requisite for <choice><sic>yetting</sic><corr>letting</corr></choice> passes.  The books show that less than half that number of contracts have been signed, so that as a matter of fact the number of country publications in half a dozen states that Mr. Rosewater was willing to concede as being reputable papers in good standing was cut down to about 450, or only 14 per cent.</p>
                            <p>R. B. Owens, who has been acting as superintendent of the machinery and electricity section, severed his <choice><sic>conenction</sic><corr>connection</corr></choice> with the exposition on the 15th inst., as the duties of his new position in the educational world call him to Canada.</p>

                            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Police Judge Gordon saw fit to discharge B. R. Emery on a charge of petit larceny, in face of the admission of Emery that he had been short-changing visitors to the Long Maned Horse concession whenever he had the opportunity, the exposition management forthwith cancelled Emery's pass and declared that he would <choice><sic>not</sic><corr>no</corr></choice> longer be allowed to work on the <choice><sic>gruonds</sic><corr>grounds</corr></choice>.

                            <head type="sub">White and Colored Congress and National Personal Liberty League Meetings.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Joint Opening at the Auditorium---Delegates Welcomed by State and City---Responses and Music.</head>
                            <p>The congress of white and colored Americans and the Colored National Personal Liberty league held their first meeting jointly in the Auditorium on the exposition grounds yesterday forenoon.  The delegates for the most part entered at the big gate since they did not desire to have the privileges of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps 200 were present.  E. R. Overall, chairman of the local committee on arrangements for the congress, presided.  "The Star Spangled Banner" was sung by a chorus of forty picked from the colored churches of the city, and prayer was offered by Rev. W. E. De Claybrook of Denver.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Overall then delivered a preliminary address.  He remarked that Omaha was the most fit spot for the holding of the congress because Nebraska was common ground where all classes could meet and discuss any questions.  He prophesied that an exchange of views by representatives of both races would do much to remove the prejudices and friction between the white and colored.</p>
                            <p>One of the questions, Mr. Overall said, that should engage the most serious attention of the congress was the disregard of law and order in many sections.  Jails, instead of being places of detention and protection, were in many instances but the cages where prisoners were entrapped to be turned over for fiendish treatment by the populace.  Another question was, What is the proper position of the colored man <choice><sic>be fore</sic><corr>before</corr></choice> the world?  Ought he not to be more than a menial to the whites?  This was the land of the American black man's nativity.  He deserved to enjoy all its blessings.</p>
                            <p>The address of welcome on behalf of the state was delivered by Lieutenant Governor Harris, at present the acting governor.  His interest in the colored people, he said, had been life-long and as a boy he had pleaded for their emancipation.  All the questions between the races could be settled by a reference to and appeal to common manhood.  The governor was loudly cheered as he mentioned the names of some of the great colored men of history and commended the excellent qualities of the negro.</p>
                            <p>Response was made by Dr. W. S. Howell of Kansas City.  He felt that the governor had struck the keynote, and he knew the time was soon coming when the black man who deserved to do so could take his place and would be freely accorded his place by the side of his peers of any race.  The doctor declared he had no sympathy with the sentiment that the blacks should emigrate.  This was their own land and country.  He would not say, as Booker Washington, "Black man, take your pick and shovel," but he would say, "Black man go to congress if you can.  Go wherever a demonstration of manhood is desired."  If the colored people

                            could not succeed under the stars and stripes they could not succeed anywhere.  When he thought of thirty years ago and of the present, he felt sure that the race question was slowly solving itself.</p>
                            <p>The song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," by the chorus followed.</p>
                            <p>Welcome on behalf of the city was extended by Mayor Moores.  It was a <choice><sic>panygeric</sic><corr>panegyric</corr></choice> on the progress of the colored race since the civil war.</p>
                            <p>W. E. Gladden of Colorado responded to the address of the mayor in a brief address well received.</p>
                            <p>The exercises closed with a cornet solo by P. G. Lowrey of Topeka; a recitation by Miss Overall, and the song, "The Boys Who Wore the Blue Are Turning Gray," by a quartet comprising Walter Bell, William Thirkles, Dumas James and Jesse Green.</p>

                            <p>Last winter the management of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition sent delegations of Omaha citizens on special trains all over the country to drum up interest in the exposition.

                            <p>A party of Indians, in charge of "Rattlesnake Pete," W. H. Liddiard, came down from the exposition yesterday morning and visited the stock yards and some of the packing houses.  There were about a dozen in the company, and notwithstanding the unusual good food they are enjoying at the hands of Uncle Sam at the exposition, the scent of fresh meat at the packing houses greatly irritated the stomachs of some of them, who insisted upon making a raid on the good things there.  The Indians were later taken to City Clerk Carpenter's office and given each an official souvenir badge of the exposition, and were otherwise entertained while here.</p>

                            <p>The following is taken from the news columns of a local publication:</p>
                            <quote>
                                <p>Indignant at the delay of the association the three general passenger agents of Omaha had decided to take individual action toward lower rates, when the inopportune publication of an article in a local paper making an arrogant assault on the passenger men balked the game.  There was a meeting at Elkhorn headquarters on Tuesday, attended by General Passenger Agents Francis of the Burlington &amp; Missouri, Buchanan of the Elkhorn and Chief Clerk Murray of the Union Pacific.</p>
                                <p>After the meeting one of these gentlemen said:  "Individual action would undoubtedly have been taken at the meeting had it not been for one thing.  Things looked very much like a decision to announce lower rates individually when some one came in and called our attention to the attack on us in a local paper, and the threat to force lower rates within five days.  None of us had seen the article, as we do not read the paper, but when the man commenced to 'josh' us about it we decided that we wouldn't give the paper attacking us any chance to crow over us and cry out: 'See what we did.'  So no individual action was taken, and I do not know as there will be now."</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>It is pretty late in the day for the railroad representatives to assume the role of injured innocence.  It is now well known to the committee representing Omaha's interests that it has been systematically deceived by the local companies as regards the action of those companies in the way of obtaining reasonable railroad rates.  The local committee has been assured time and again that the Western Passenger association would meet at stated times and the local committee was assured that the representatives of the local companies had made certain recommendations which, as a matter of fact, had not been made.  It was given out that the Western Passenger association would meet yesterday.  Now we are assured that the association will meet "about Thursday of next week."</p>
                            <p>It has slowly but surely dawned upon the minds of those familiar with the situation that the representatives of the local companies have failed to do their duty, and this was apparent long before the World-Herald made "an arrogant assault on the passenger men."  As a matter of fact, the World-Herald made no assault upon the passenger men.  It criticised the railroad companies in language perhaps severe, but certainly justified, and demanded that justice be done to Omaha in the matter of passenger rates.  A representative of one of the local companies, so we are informed by the exact reproduced above, asserts that individual action on the part of the railroad companies was prevented by the World-Herald's demand for justice to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>It has come to a pretty pass that a newspaper published in a city which has been imposed upon and preyed upon by these corporations dare not even voice the public sentiment in a demand for exact justice.</p>
                            <p>It has come to a pretty pass when a city so large as Omaha must depend entirely upon the good nature and disposition of railroad officials to give that city that which properly belongs to it.</p>
                            <p>The attempt of the gentlemen quoted above to pose as martyrs cannot be effective.  Omaha would long ago have had reasonable railroad rates if the representatives of the companies that depend upon Omaha for support had been disposed to do the proper thing.  Entirely familiar with the game of deception that has been played upon Omaha by the representatives of these local companies, the World-Herald, without mincing words, places the responsibility on these gentlemen.  We do not know what idea of self-interest or general interest these gentlemen may have cultivated to induce them to pursue a course calculated to do injury to Nebraska and to do injury to their own companies, but we do know that the failure to obtain reasonable railroad rates to Omaha is now properly chargeable to these local companies.  They must bear the responsibility and no cheap talk to the effect that because the World-Herald did its duty in registering a protest will be of any avail.</p>
                            <p>These gentlemen may have the idea, so succinctly expressed by a Union Pacific official on Tuesday, that "Omaha can do nothing against the combined railroads."  That is a matter yet to be determined.  If the issue must be defined between the "combined railroads" and the combined citizenship of Omaha then the World-Herald is proud to place itself on the side of Omaha.  Because this city has suffered imposition, humiliation and disgrace at the hands of these corporations&#8212;patiently for so many years&#8212;is no reason that there is not in this city a strong and determined public purpose capable of being fully aroused.</p>
                            <p>With the Commercial club committee and other representatives of Omaha the World-Herald has pleaded repeatedly for decent railroad rates&#8212;pleaded in that humble tone which seems to be demanded by the railroad autocrat.  But so far as the World-Herald is concerned the day for pleading and entreaty has gone by.  The people of Omaha know what their rights are and although there may be a few whose interests will be lulled to sleep by special favors granted in the pastor promised for the future, or by fear of special impositions laid by these corporations, the overwhelming majority of the property owners in this city are not afraid to stand for their rights and to employ every legitimate power to obtain those rights.</p>
                            <p>The World-Herald does not expect that the railroads will grant to Omaha reasonable rates "within the next five days."  The representatives of these roads have never done justice to Omaha, and it is already plain that they are not disposed to do justice to Omaha in the present<unclear reason="torn"/> of the combined <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>It is probably true that because of the blindness of some of our local railroad officials rates will not come down.</p>
                            <p>But if railroad rates do not come down it may be depended upon that VIADUCTS WILL GO UP.</p>

                            <p>Heaven and Hell has opened under its new name of Darkness and Dawn and is gorgeous in every detail.  Its magnificence is beyond the expectations of everyone.  From the time one enters the beautiful lobby, passes down the descending passage into Hell until even Paradise is reached and one finds himself back into the lobby by a different way it seems like a weird but beautiful dream.  The Cabaret de la Mort is a wonder and while the idea of drinking and eating off of coffins and being served by pretty widows was not fascinating, the reality was far from being horrible.  A monk guides the way from there into the infernal region, whose ghastly beauty beggars description because of its weird grandeur.  St. Peter, in gala attire, was on guard at the gate to heaven and admitted one and all without exception.  After climbing the golden stairs a vista of a beautiful grotto of gold, radiant under brilliant electric effects, with countless glittering crystal stalactites, left an impression long to be remembered.  And the performance, too.  In keeping with its environment and taking place upon the surface of a beautiful lake of water, with electric fountains in the foreground.  Beautiful maidens sang and danced under 60,000 candle power of light, robed in costumes the finest yet seen on the Midway.</p>

                            <p>The emblem of the Lone Star states floats from the tallest flagstaff at the exposition grounds today, and its official and civic representatives are conspicuous in the throng of visitors.  The celebration of Texas day is one of the most interesting and successful of the state occasions that have occurred.  The enthusiasm that has marked every event in which the people of that state have had a hand was notable in the Auditorium, where the exercises of the day were held, and the sentiments of the speakers were almost continuously applauded by one of the biggest audiences that has been brought together by any similar occasion.</p>
                            <p>The Texans distinguish themselves by the unusual feat of beginning their exercises promptly on time.  The official party reached the Auditorium just before 11 o'clock, headed by President Wattles of the exposition association and Governor Culberson.  Its entrance was greeted by hearty applause from the audience.  After a selection by the Musical Union band Vice President Johnson of the Texas commission introduced Acting Governor J. E. Harris of Nebraska, who appropriately welcomed the visitors.  He said that we have one giantess in our roll of states that occupies one-eleventh of our territory and is rapidly pushing to the front in wealth and industries.  Nebraska desires to extend a hearty welcome to its guests.  This exposition does not belong to Nebraska, but to the whole transmississippi country.  The speaker congratulated his auditors on the fact that there is no longer north nor south, but a common country, a common flag and a common destiny.</p>
                            <p>The introduction of Governor Culberson to respond to the welcoming address was received with liberal hand clapping, which continued during his remarks.  He said they will return to Texas with many pleasant memories of the hospitable reception they have received.  There is a tie of kinship between Nebraska and Texas.  Both originally belonged to Spain.  Sprung from the same great race and mutually interested in transportation problems, their interests are very <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Speaking of the exposition, Governor Culberson declared that with the exception of the World's fair and the Centennial it has never had a rival in this country.  It is not alone an exposition of mining and manufacturing industries, but of agriculture.  A large proportion of the agricultural product of this country is produced in Nebraska, Oklahoma, Kansas and other states which find deep water nearer on the Texas coast than anywhere else.  All are interested in finding the shortest and cheapest route for the delivery of their corn and wheat.  This can best be secured by co-operation in the effort to secure deep water harbors on the Gulf of Mexico.  He briefly outlined what had already been accomplished in this direction and cited figures to illustrate the advantage of the southern outlet and the vast increase in exports from Texas ports since the movement has been inaugurated.  In conclusion, he reiterated the expression of appreciation of the welcome that had greeted them in Omaha, and after another selection from the band President Wattles greeted the Texas visitors as the representatives of the exposition management.  He said that the people of Nebraska are not unfamiliar with the vast resources, extensive territory and progressive population of Texas.  Many of them have sought homes there and no small amount of Nebraska capital has gone to assist in the development of its southern neighbor.  He expressed the appreciation of the management of the hearty co-operation of Texas in pushing the exposition and emphasized the hope that every dollar it has expended will return a thousand fold in new capital and population.  He discussed at some length the remarkable progress of the Lone Star state since it became a part of the union and declared that its future could not be foretold by its most enthusiastic prophet.</p>

                            <p>The address of the day was delivered by ex-Governor R. B. Hubbard, who declared that Texas has brought its oldest and its youngest governor to receive the genial welcome of this occasion and, in allusion to himself, the biggest one between.  In referring to the history of Texas, he declared that it showed that its people had both brain and brawn and patriotism more than both.  Their first act after the end of their struggle for independence was to set aside 276,000,000 acres of land for the children of those who had fallen in the fray.  Next they appropriated millions of acres for a university and for philanthropic institutions and the results are now beginning to appear.</p>
                            <p>Governor Hubbard continued at some length to portray the conditions that have developed with the advancement of the state.  This was accomplished without statistics and in a humorous vein that kept the crowd thoroughly entertained.  He discussed the development of the railroads, cotton, wool, cattle and grain industries and the mineral resources that would soon become an important factor in its prosperity.  They have iron ore so pure that the blacksmiths use it in its natural state to make horseshoes.  Petroleum is beginning to spout from hundreds of wells and will soon add another powerful impetus to the progress of the state by solving the fuel problem that has stood in the way of the development of some of its resources.</p>
                            <p>After the speaking the official guests of the day were entertained at lunch at the Casino by the exposition officials.</p>

                            <p>The Texas rangers and their families formed a very considerable part of the arriving visitors to the exposition on Wednesday and Thursday.  More came in on the latter day than on Wednesday, and in all there were between 500 and 600, which is regarded as a numerous party to travel such a long distance.  There are somewhat over 1,000 miles between the Gulf of Mexico and Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The citizen who expected Texas to be represented by a crowd of immensely tall and rather gaunt individuals, with their trousers tucked in their boots and revolvers tucked in their belts, were undeceived as the various parties from that state appeared about town, the men becomingly attired and the women nattily gowned according to the latest fashion plates.  They did not look so very different from the representatives of other states who have attended the exposition.  All of them took a trip through some part of the down town district in going from the passenger stations to the exposition grounds, but they were so eager to see the promised grounds and buildings that they did not tarry long in the business portion of the city.  They promised to do that another day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">One Cent a Mile from Denver and a Promise of Other Reductions in Spite of the Western Passenger Association.</head>
                            <p>The retardative measures adopted by the Western Passenger association in regard to reduced railroad rates to Omaha during the remainder of the exposition are not sufficient to prevent individual action being taken by the Omaha terminal lines in favor of lower rates for the exposition was not cordially received by the Omaha passenger men, and called forth a number of harsh comments on the apparent attempt of the association to defer the granting of reasonable rates until September 1.</p>
                            <p>The railroads that are friendly to Omaha are gradually breaking away from the association.  General Passenger Agent Heafford of the Milwaukee road has just announced that a round trip rate of $10 from Chicago to Omaha and return will undoubtedly be made for Chicago day at the Exposition, which will be celebrated on October 1.  General Western Agent Nash of the Milwaukee received a telegram to this effect from his general passenger agent on Thursday morning.</p>
                            <p>Should the other lines agree to this rate at next Thursday's meeting, or prior to that time, there will unquestionably be a large amount of travel from Chicago for all four Omaha-Chicago lines.  If no agreement on the $10 round trip rate is reached the Milwaukee will put it in effect anyway and haul the crowds.</p>
                            <p>During the morning the Burlington and the Union Pacific railroads also showed their independence of the Western Passenger association by announcing a rate of 1 cent per mile from points in Colorado to Omaha for Colorado day at the exposition&#8212;September 9.</p>
                            <p>This action was taken when it was learned that the association would not meet to discuss exposition rates until August 25, allowing but little time after that date to advertise Colorado day.  Both the Burlington and the Union Pacific passenger departments are planning to push Colorado day hard and expect to make it the biggest state date that has yet been celebrated on the exposition grounds.  The rate of 1 cent per mile will apply in each direction.  Denver is 538 miles from Omaha on the shortest line, so that the round trip may be made on Colorado day for less than $11.</p>

                            <p>The Elkhorn railroad announces a school excursion, similar to the one it conducted last week from Norfolk and intermediate points, to occur on Wednesday, August 24.  It will include stations between York and Fremont.  The Union Pacific school excursion is arranged for Friday, August 26, and will take in stations from Columbus to Papillion, inclusive, with the exception of Fremont, which thinks it can fill a train after the schools begin in September.  The rates are as follows:  Columbus, $1; Benton, 90 cents; Schuyler, 85 cents; Rogers, 75 cents; North Bend, 65 cents; Ames, 60 cents; Valley, 45 cents; Waterloo, 35 cents; Elkhorn, Millard Portal and Papillion, 25 cents.  The age limit for these rates is 18 years.  Adult attendants can purchase tickets for twice the sum, but no tickets will be sold except to parents and others in charge of children.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Frances E. Ford took up the excursion of children from Lincoln to the exposition on Thursday of next week with the passenger department of the Burlington road this morning.  Arrangements were completed for running a special train for the children.  The excursion will be from Lincoln and Ashland and all points between these two towns, but no stops will be made this side of Ashland.</p>
                            <p>The special train will leave Lincoln at 7 a. m., arriving here at 8:30.  A number of special street cars will be in waiting at the station here to carry the children directly to the exposition grounds.  The train will return early in the evening.  The following rates have been declared for the round trip for children between 5 and 16 years of age:  Lincoln, 65 cents; Havelock, 65 cents; Waverly, 60 cents; Greenwood, 50 cents, and Ashland, 50 cents.  Parents and other adults in charge of children will be carried for double the children's rate.  No passes will be good on the special train.</p>

                            <p>More than a dozen big cases were received at the Georgia state building yesterday and upon the sides, each had four sheet posters, on which were printed in type that could be read at almost any distance the inscription:  "I am going to the Omaha exposition; keep me dry."  When opened, ex-governor Northen found many things that he wanted to complete his exhibit.  The new stuff will be arranged so that it will be ready for inspection today.</p>
                            <p>One thing, Governor Northen says, has added much to the wealth of Georgia during the past few years is the shredded corn.  This shredding is something new, not only in the south, but throughout the entire country, though some experiments have been made in Nebraska.  Speaking of shredded corn, the professor in the Georgia state experimental station says:  "Careful tests show that shredded cornstalks or cornstalk hay is a palatable and nutritious food.  Not so good as clover or pea vine hay; not so good as crab grass hay, but better in my judgment than most of the western hay that is sold in the south.  It is clean, free from weeds and briers and their seeds and is relished by horses, mules and cattle.  With a fair allowance of concentrated food, cattle do exceedingly well on corn hay.  It is not particularly suited for horses on account of its great bulkiness&#8212;the horse having a much smaller stomach than the cow.</p>
                            <p>Shredded corn is simply the leaf and stalk of the corn ground and put into bales the same as hay.  All of the shredded stalk is eaten, even the pulp, and with cows it is said to be a great milk producer.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Northen has written to each of the railroads in his state, asking them to send a statement of the number of crates shipped from Georgia during the present season and when this is received he expects to prove that his state is the greatest peach raising state in the union.  In his stock of exhibits received he has thirty varieties of canned peaches, twenty of pears and nearly forty of grapes.  These cans he will arrange on shelves and tables and when in place they will fill about all of the space that has heretofore been vacant in the building.</p>

                            <p>The 25-cent admission tonight applies only after 7 o'clock.  It was generally understood that the intent of the director who made the motion referred to 6 o'clock, but he said 7 o'clock at first and failed to make the formal correction before it was adopted.  Consequently the minutes of the secretary show that the board made 7 o'clock the hour.</p>

                            <p>Douglas county has the distinction of showing a fig tree, something seldom seen in this latitude, and what is the remarkable feature, the tree is bearing and a has a large number of figs growing upon its branches.  The tree is the property of Paul Floth of this city and is 12 years old.  Last year it bore a number of figs, but this year it is loaded.  The tree is about six feet high and appears to be healthy.  It was reared in a greenhouse, but there are things to indicate that this climate is adapted to the culture of figs, and as evidence of the statement ripe figs grown in the Nebraska ozone will be shown during the next ten days.  Hon. Robert W. Furnas of Brownville has written to Superintendent Youngers that he has a half dozen fig trees bearing and that the fruit is almost ready to pluck.  As soon as it is ripe samples will be sent to Omaha and placed in the Nebraska fruit exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska clogged the peach exhibit at the exposition yesterday and the same time the state made a showing that caused the eyes of the easterners to bulge.  Early in the morning some sixty crates came in from the southern part of the state and a few minutes later another consignment almost as large came in from Arcadia.  In addition to this there were any quantity of grapes and new apples, so that long before night the state exhibit was made to look as fresh as though it had just come from the orchard.</p>

                            <p>The dairymen of the transmississippi region are making great preparations for the butter scoring contest that will occur in the Dairy building, probably on Monday next, when the products from Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin will be entered.  At present twenty-two exhibitors are in, fifty others have applied for space and ten more are expected.  The building is in much better condition for the receipt of the butter than at the time of the July scoring as the refrigerating apparatus is now working in good shape and is capable of running the temperature down to twenty-two degrees and holding it there.  The great difficulty seems to be in getting the butter to the grounds in prime condition.  It is sent here in small parcels in express cars, not packed in ice.  Consequently it is soft upon its arrival and not as fresh appearing as it should be.</p>
                            <p>Since the last scoring contest the cases have been materially changed with reference to the cooling process and some that were then absolutely worthless are now in fine shape and hold the cold in the most satisfactory way.

They say that at the present time all of the people who visit the congress are compelled to pass the buildings in which they are located and that naturally many of the visitors, both men and women, drop in to inspect the exhibits, which they would not do if the lower gate was opened.</p>
                            <p>In support of the position which they take, the exhibitors in the main buildings on the north tract, say that there would be no saving of distance to the Indian congress by going through the south gate.  They urge that the Indians are nearly all located on the north side of the grounds and to reach them the distance is the same, no matter through which two gates the people go.</p>

                            <p>Ex-Governor Packard is busily engaged in working out the plans for Iowa day, which comes on September 21.  He has sent out letters to all of the cities and towns in the state, urging people to come and make the event the biggest feature of the exposition.  In all of the places he is trying to have exposition organizations perfected, so there may be no friction with reference to arranging the parade and the participation in the attendant ceremonies.  He expects that in each town where there is a band that the organization will come and that it will have most of the citizens in its wake.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the Iowa day ceremonies, the ex-governor said yesterday that he expected 100,000 people here and will be surprised if the attendance does not reach that number.</p>

                            <p>All of the visiting Texans and several thousand other people witnessed the display of fireworks last night.  The wind interfered somewhat with some of the set pieces, blowing the smoke over into the reserved seats.  It being Texas night, John Due, the chief of the pyrotechnics, did his best to put up something for the entertainment of the visitors and that he succeeded was evidenced by the applause that greeted the flight of bombs and the rockets.  In addition to these there was the swans upon the lake, the wheelbarrow man and the usual features.  The star of Texas was warmly greeted and as it burned up and showed "Welcome Texas" in colored fire it was received with loud applause.</p>

                            <p>Another concession, known as "Darkness and Light," opened on the Midway last night and drew a good house.  The spectators were were first ushered into an underground tomb, where they sat around and indulged in soft drinks that were served on coffins.  After this they were conducted through tunnels filled with grinning skulls and the bones of dead men, stopping for a moment in front of a fiery pit, where satan appeared to delight in toasting his subjects over sulphurous flames.  Here St. Peter appeared and taking the lead, escorted the visitors into a little auditorium where girls representing angels performed all of the latest dances, clothing in the most light, gauzy and airy costumes.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Missouri Pacific and Burlington Indulge in a Little Side Row.</head>
                            <p>A man walked into a local ticket office yesterday afternoon and said:  "Give me a ticket to St. Joseph."  He laid down $4 and expected to get 5 cents in change.  Instead the ticket agent said:  "I can sell you a round trip ticket good for five days for $1.75," and the surprised commercial traveler nearly dropped to the floor.  He remarked that he had been traveling ten years, but never had the good fortune to strike a cut rate before.</p>
                            <p>There is a merry little fight for St. Joseph business from Omaha and for Omaha travel from St. Joseph now on between the Burlington and the Missouri Pacific roads.  The ordinary one way fare is $3.95, but on account of the fight the round trip tickets are on sale for $1.75.  Up until recently the Burlington has had the field on this business to itself, but recently the Missouri Pacific effected a combination with the St. Joseph and Grand Island from Hiawatha, Kan., to St. Joseph, Mo., allowing through trains to be run between Omaha and St. Joseph over these two lines.  The fight really commenced last Saturday when the St. Joseph excursions were run to the exposition and <unclear reason="covered"/>s continued with considerable sharpness <unclear reason="covered"/>ce then.  The passenger men of each line <unclear reason="covered"/>his city said yesterday they had no idea how long the reduced rate would remain in effect.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Eminent Colored Jurist Descants on the Probable Fruit of the Congress of White and Colored Americans Just Ended.</head>
                            <p>The florists and the members of the White and Colored American congress are given special recognition at the grounds today, but neither body was apparent to any considerable extent.  A large number of the florists had remained in Omaha as long as they could stay away from their business and did not stay to visit the exposition again today, and the delegates to the congress were comparatively limited.  They were supposed to assemble at the Auditorium at 11 o'clock to listen to an address by Judge D. Augustus Straker of Detroit, but most of them had had a surfeit of addresses during the last few days and preferred to spend their time in seeing the show.</p>
                            <p>This did not detract, however, from the interest of Judge Straker's remarks, which deserved a better audience.  He was introduced by General Manager Clarkson, who stated that he is the first and only man of his color who had been elected to the bench in Michigan by vote of the people.</p>
                            <p>Judge Straker's address was brief but decidedly entertaining.  He congratulated the exposition management on the fact that it has extended this invitation to the representatives of the white and colored races to meet in Omaha.  Nebraska has always been foremost in progress, breadth of thought and patriotism, and it is fitting that it should be the state to inaugurate in this country the assemblage of the two races together for the common benefit of both.  The seed may be small, but he expressed the belief that the tree will expand until it covered a much larger representation than is now present.  The speaker suggested that this congress is particularly opportune at this time.  The people of this country were no longer a family at home, but their borders have been extended and a new class of people included in their citizenship.  A large part of these are a mixture of Latin and African blood and it was particularly appropriate that the white and colored races should now meet together to consider the rights of man.</p>
                            <p>Continuing Judge Straker briefly discussed the progress that had been made during the last thirty years toward a more thorough understanding in this respect.  Domestic differences still exist between the two races, but they were one in everything that related to their citizenship and their loyalty to their country.  He urged the colored delegates to cultivate a more vigorous spirit of unity and pride of race and to endeavor to deserve in every respect the dignity of American citizenship.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Half Rate Brings Out Many Thousands Who Enjoy the Show.</head>
                            <p>The combined inducement of a 25-cent admission and two concerts of more than ordinary merit was sufficient to fairly pack the exposition grounds last night.  It was by thousands the biggest crowd seen on the grounds with the exception of one or two record breaking occasions and it settled the value of the reduced evening admission as an attendance inducing agency.  With a big daylight crowd already on the grounds, the evening arrivals were numbered by thousands.  From 6 o'clock the motor trains had all the people they could carry and for nearly two hours every car was loaded to the footboards long before it reached the grounds.  It was a case of standing room only before they got half a dozen blocks from Farnam street and they unloaded their freight almost as fast as the full shift of ticket sellers and gatekeepers could handle them.  Long lines of people were massed in front of the ticket windows and every turnstile clicked continuously.</p>
                            <p>By the time the electric lights illuminated the enclosure it was crowded from the Indian <choice><sic>emcampment</sic><corr>encampment</corr></choice> to the Missouri bluff.  The main court was thronged with promenaders and every available seat was occupied <choice><sic>aroung</sic><corr>around</corr></choice> the lagoon.  Across the viaduct the Plaza was packed from the bandstand back to the Casino and for the first time in the experience of exposition patrons every reserved seat was taken before the concert had scarcely begun.</p>
                            <p>Even with an immense concert crowd on the Plaza and another in the Auditorium the Midway played to full houses and when these were over and the additional crowd poured into the amusement section the street was crowded from wall to wall.  The speilers were literally overwhelmed with the crush in the street and inside the resorts the crowd was almost equally in evidence.  After the concert the people began to drop away, but it was late in the evening before there was any perceptible diminution in the throngs that remained on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>By 10 o'clock the homeward rush was fairly under way and then the motor trains were inundated.  Every car that stopped at one of the main entrances was besieged by enough passengers to fill a railroad train and when a small percentage of them had secured an opportunity to hang on by their eyebrows it moved away and gave place to another which was also swamped.  From then until midnight the people swarmed out of the entrances as fast as three motor lines could carry them away.</p>

                            <p>In addition to the regular features there will be a number of special attractions to interest exposition visitors tomorrow afternoon and evening.  The most interesting event will be a series of races and other amusements at the Indian encampment, beginning at 2 o'clock, at which the following events will be pulled off:  2 p. m., 100-yard foot race between Sioux, Apaches, Blackfeet, Omahas and Flatheads; 2:15 p. m., squaw race, fifty yards; 2:30 p. m., foot race for boys under 12, fifty yards; 2:40 p. m., sack race for interpreters; 3 p. m., moccasin race, all tribes; 3:20 p. m., horse race, one-half mile, all tribes; 3:40 p. m., dog feast and dance; 8 p. m., all dance.</p>
                            <p>This entertainment will be entirely free to the public.  The crack battalion of the High school cadets will give an exhibition drill on the Plaza from 6:30 to 7 o'clock, or immediately preceding the regular evening concert.  The celebration will conclude with a display of fireworks on the north tract at 9 o'clock.</p>

                            <p>The off-day record of attendance was broken yesterday by several thousand.  The total attendance was 20,897 of which over 15,000 was paid.</p>
                            <p>There will be religious services in the Auditorium at 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon.  The discourse will be delivered by Rev. Thomas E. Green of Cedar Rapids, Ia., and the full choir of All Saints Episcopal church will furnish the music.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Quick of Sioux City has announced his intention to proclaim Sioux City day, August 25, a holiday, and in his proclamation he will urge the people to attend the celebration at the exposition in as large numbers as possible.</p>
                            <p>The management has scheduled Monday, August 29, as transmississippi hotel men's day, and September 19 as Wyoming day.  The railroads have agreed on a 1-cent a mile rate from all Colorado, Wyoming and Utah points on their respective days.</p>
                            <p>One of the employes of the Scenic Railway was taken to the hospital yesterday, suffering from a bad case of seeing things.  He was partially relieved but escaped from the ward and secured another supply of booze.  He was rounded up and packed off to the city jail to sober up.</p>
                            <p>The exposition has developed a pugilist.  He is Dockman Effendi, who has been punching the bag at the Streets of Cairo.  All along he has been considered a handy man with his fists, but no one thought that he was more than an expert bag puncher.  By birth he is an Armenian and was educated at the college of Constantinople.  Yesterday he issued his manifesto and says that he is ready to meet any medium weight on the face of the earth.</p>
                            <p>J. C. Evans of the executive committee of the Missouri exposition commission arrived in the city yesterday and will remain several days.  Speaking of the exposition, he said:  "It is much better than I expected to find it.  It is a most creditable display of the resources of this section of the country and will be largely attended during September and October."  Mr. Evans is one of the great fruit raiser of Missouri, having 1,600 acres in his orchards.  For thirty-six years he was president of the State Horticultural society and at the election last year refused to accept a re-election.</p>
                            <p>October 5 promises to be a day of many and varied attractions.  Not only is the Pennsylvania celebration scheduled for that day, but the Ohio people are planning a grand demonstration on the same date.  The people of Toledo have arranged to come in a special train, which will arrive in Omaha on the morning of October 5.  The train will be equipped with the most magnificent rolling stock that can be secured and the party will be a large and representative one.  It will carry Governor Bushnell and staff, Mayor S. M. Jones and wife and a large number of state officials and prominent citizens.  The members of the state centennial commission will also come in a body with a view to securing information that will be of benefit in preparing for the Ohio centennial in 1899.</p>

                            <head type="sub">INDIANS WITH GOOD RECORDS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Descendants of Logan Fontanelle Continue to Multiply.</head>
                            <p>There is another baby in the Indian camp on the exposition grounds.  The parents of the little thing are Christopher and Edith Tyndall. both of whom are from the Omaha reservation.  The little Indian first saw the light of day yesterday and was ushered into existence much the same as white children.  The mother, however, did not mind a little thing like than and was up at the usual hour preparing the morning meal and attending to her household duties about the tepee.  While the baby has not yet been christened, for the present and until it is given some other name, it will be known as Little Congress.</p>
                            <p>There is nothing remarkable or wonderful about Little Congress.  In fact he is just like any other little Indian.  He has a pair of good lungs and he manages to use them, but his father comes from stock that has a history.  Mr. Tyndall bears the distinction of being the great-grandson of Logan Fontanelle, who is buried on the bluff at Bellevue, overlooking the Missouri river.  The elder Fontanelle settled in this section of the country more than a century ago.  He was one of the men who signed the treaty ceding this portion of Nebraska to the United States.  The Fontanelle family has always been friendly to the whites and Christopher boasts of the fact that none of his ancestors ever shed a drop of white blood.  During the wars that followed the early settlements of Nebraska and the great west, his ancestors were always with the whites, but, of course, were interested in seeing that the Indians secured what was their own.  At the present time Mr. Tyndall is one of the leading men of the Omahas and is wealthy, being the owner of about 100 cattle and a large number of horses.  He is a farmer and this year raised several hundred bushels of wheat and has out some fifty acres of corn.  He has an interesting family, consisting of a wife and three children.</p>
                            <p>One of the most interesting characters in the Indian village is Standing Bear, a Sioux from Pine Ridge agency.  He lives in a tepee while on the grounds, but at home he resides in a fine log house and has a wife and several children, most of whom are grown.  Standing Bear lives about fifty miles from the agency and has given up his roving life and has settled down to become a tiller of the soil.  He is some 50 years of age and has accumulated considerable wealth, being at the present time possessed of 500 head of cattle, thirty horses and a little flock of sheep.  Standing Bear is no dude, but he proposes to live in style and since his arrival in the city he has purchased a two-seated family carriage, a one-seated trap and a farm wagon.  These vehicles were purchased of the Omaha dealers and shipped to the agency, Mr. Bear paying cash and receiving his discount.</p>
                            <p>Another interesting Indian is Red Eagle from Pine Ridge agency.  He has always <unclear reason="torn"/>
                            
                            <pb n="79" xml:id="TMISB06-079"/>
                            
                            has a wife and one child, a boy.  At the present time he is devoting the whole of his energies to farming and stock raising.  He has nearly 100 acres under cultivation and owns 600 cattle and 200 ponies.  Having discarded the blanket, he dresses in tailor made <choice><sic>cdothes</sic><corr>clothes</corr></choice> and makes a fine appearance when seen upon the streets of the exposition or the Midway.</p>
                            <p>American Horse is recognized as the chief of the Sioux nation, but is not in attendance upon the exposition, though he will be here next week to meet his old friend, William F. Cody.  After visiting Cody he will remain with the Indian congress for several days and will address the gathering.  American Horse is the orator of the Sioux and is a most fluent and entertaining speaker.  He resides on the Medicine Root river on the Pine Ridge agency reservation and is probably the most influential Indian in the United States.  He has visited Washington a number of times and has met all of the presidents since Garfield's administration.  He is an Ogalalla Sioux and has been in the councils since he was 21 years of age.  Now he is nearly 60.  He is a farmer and stock raiser and lives in a comfortable two-story frame house.  He cultivates a large tract of land and owns 300 head of cattle and 108 horses and ponies.  His son, Joseph American Horse, is an interpreter at the Indian congress and is a young man of great promise.  Joseph has attended the Carlisle school, as have two of his brothers and four sisters.  The young man has taken up farming as a vocation, but has a tendency to like race horses and since his return from school a few years ago has bred several fast horses, among which is Yellow Eyes, a bay mare that has a record of one-fourth of a mile in 23 seconds.  In addition to this he has a horse that has a record for six miles and can beat anything on the reservation.  At the farm young American Horse has a half mile track where he trains his horses which he is breeding.  In the near future he expects to bring out a string of trotters and runners which he says will distance anything that the white men have ever put upon the turf.</p>

                            <p>The exposition visitors who have missed the cold water contents of the various free drinking fountains scattered around the grounds will now secure relief.  At the meeting of the executive committee yesterday it was decided to begin putting ice in the tanks again, notwithstanding the protests of the concessions department and the concessionist who has the monopoly of the penny in the slot ice water machines.  It was on account of the dissatisfaction of this individual that the ice was shut off several weeks ago, but the committee has decided that the people have some rights in the matter and it is now promised that water will be free on the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <p>President Overall appointed the following advisory boards:</p>
                            <p>Missouri&#8212;Dr. J. A. Crossland, St. Joseph; Dr. H. S. Powell, Kansas City; Charles S. Hunter, St. Joseph.</p>

                            <p>The chief subject under discussion at last night's meeting was "A Liberal and Fearless Press as a Factor in Moulding Public Sentiment."  The first speaker was Cyrus D. Bell of Omaha.  He emphasized the influence of the press upon the public mind and ascribed to it a higher place in forming public opinion than the pulpit.</p>
                            <p>Rev. Williams followed in a short address, in which he commended the press of Omaha for its disposition to help people who desire to help themselves.  He pointed to the power that is wielded by a fearless press and urged that every possible influence by brought to enlist the entire press of the United States in the cause of the colored man.</p>
                            <p>Because of a clause in the rules of the association requiring that the president and secretary be from the same state, Charles S. Hunter of St. Joseph resigned the office of secretary, to which he was elected, and H. Plummer of Omaha was elected to fill the office.</p>
                            <p>E. L. Blackshear of Texas arrived at Creighton hall just before the meeting adjourned, having been delayed in arriving in the city.  Mr. Blackshear is a prominent educator in Texas and favored the congress with a short address.  He alluded to the fact that the state of Texas contains more than 300,000 negroes and showed what a great problem their education and elevation is.  Among the drawbacks to the advancement of the race is an ignorant ministry, and the teachers are not all that they might be both mentally and morally.  He urged that colored boys be encouraged to enter trades and business and that they be taught to be provident and to realize the truth of Booker T. Washington's saying that there is no prejudice in a dollar.</p>
                            <p>Judge D. A. Straker of Detroit is in the city and was to have attended the meeting last night, but was prevented by illness.  Judge Straker is to be the chief orator at the celebration of Colored American day at the exposition today and will speak in the Auditorium at 11 a. m.</p>

                            <p>The territory of Oklahoma had things all its own way again yesterday and during the afternoon hundreds of the people on the grounds adjourned toward its exhibit.  During the morning another car of the products of the territory arrived.  There was half a carload of watermelons and these were served to the visitors.  Each member of the executive committee was furnished with huge melons, which were sent to their homes.  Melons were also sent to all of the exposition offices on the grounds, so that all of the clerks and employes were supplied.  The melons were huge fellows, many of them tipping the scales at fifty and sixty pounds each.</p>
                            <p>In addition to melons the Texas exhibit received corn, oats, barley, samples of the root crop and specimens of all of the vegetables grown in the state.  There was a quantity of new cotton and a quantity of peanuts.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Riley of Oklahoma, who has been here during the last few weeks, leaves for home today, where he will begin the work of gathering another carload of agricultural and horticultural products that will be here about September 1.  About that time 5,000 baskets of grapes will arrive from the territory.  These will be given away and upon that occasion Oklahoma will observe its Grape day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Attendance at the Exposition from Northwestern Missouri Has Been Enormously Increased by the Cheap Fares Now Offered.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The cut in railroad rates between St. Joseph, Mo., and Omaha from $3.95 for one way to $1.75 for the round trip is having a good effect on the exposition attendance from the northwestern section of Missouri.  The Burlington brought in a special train of nine cars, carrying between 500 and 600 people from St. Joseph and vicinity, at 4 o'clock this morning.  They left home at midnight.  These excursionists probably got the earliest start for a day at the exposition of any visitors or home folks yet.  They were at the exposition gates as soon as the ticket sellers.</p>
                            <p>In addition to this special train the regular trains of the Missouri Pacific and of the Burlington are doing twice as heavy a business between here and St. Joseph, in both directions, as ever before in the history of the roads.  The Missouri Pacific officials are congratulating themselves on their foresight in making a deal for through train service with the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island road.  And the Burlington people are glad that they put on their "Exposition Flyer" between here and St. Joseph, as it has already proved to be a good revenue earner.</p>
                            <p>The St. Joseph folks who spent last Saturday here celebrating St. Joe day have developed into splendid advertisers of the exposition, and now their friends and relatives are coming up to see the big show in numerous parties.  Many of those who were here last week have taken advantage of the cheap rate to pay the exposition a second visit.  As it is not known how long the reduced rate will be in effect the St. Joe people are not delaying their trips here.  Their tickets are good for five days, so they all have a reasonable length of time in which to see the exposition.  Most of them who come up on special excursions return on the regular trains.  As they return at different times the return traffic is very well distributed among the regular trains.  The local passenger men of both the fighting lines also report that a number of visitors from other sections of the country are making use of the cut rate to visit Missouri.</p>

                            <p>The success of the rate between Omaha and St. Joseph has convinced the Omaha passenger men that large crowds of people throughout the west can be moved to the exposition if only low rates are announced now and not held back until the latter days of the show.</p>
                            <p>In speaking of the rate situation a well known Omaha railroader, who has worked hard for lower rates, says:  "It must be admitted that the Western Passenger association has 'balled' the rates to the exposition.  The rates to the World's fair were 'balled' and the tangle wasn't straightened out until near the close and things have not been any better with our exposition.  Caldwell has succeeded in convincing most of the lines that their interests can be protected only by united action.  That is true to a certain extent, but on this occasion it has been worked to an absurd degree.  What some of the lines, backed up by Caldwell, are trying to do is to hold off low rates to the exposition until September 1.  This is not fair, although such delay might help the summer tourist business for all western lines.  But the people are ready to move now and would move if low rates were offered.</p>
                            <p>The exposition authorities asked for the low rates to become effective on August 20 and that was a very reasonable time.  The rates should have gone in then.  I do not <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>A concert was given last evening in the Auditorium at the exposition grounds in the presence of a very small audience.  The fact that the performers are of slender reputation doubtless accounted for it.  At best a piano recital can hardly compete with a free band concert.  Miss Jeanette Durno, the pianist, possesses great technique and plays with considerable force.  Her program was selected from the works of Leschetizky, Chopin, Schuett, Laidow, Grieg and Liszt.  It will be noticed that no American composer is included in this list.  The chief excellence in Miss Durno's work lay in her octave playing, which was quite remarkable.</p>
                            <p>Miss Durno was assisted by Mr. Frank Pollock, tenor.  This young man has a good voice of limited range and at times pleasing quality.  It is fairly well cultivated also.  Miss Julia Officer played the <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The labored efforts of the editor of the World-Herald to show that the country press is arrayed in opposition to the Department of Publicity and Promotion are rapidly becoming ridiculous.  The occasional instances that he is able to cite in support of his contention fail to pan out when the actual facts are ascertained.  The last eruption of this sort refers to an alleged neglect of the Dubuque, Ia., Herald by the department and is based on the following letter, which Hitchcok alleges to have received from the editor of that paper:</p>
                            <p>DUBUQUE, Ia., Aug. 12, 1898.&#8212;World-Herald, Omaha:  Dear Sirs&#8212;Some weeks ago I saw in your paper that a spirited controversy was going on between the management of the exposition and Mr. Rosewater as to the courtesies that were to be extended to the press.  My <choice><sic>impresssion</sic><corr>impression</corr></choice> was that the management desired to be liberal with the press and that Rosewater opposed it.  He must have carried the day, for notwithstanding we have published column after column about the exposition not even a suggestion of tickets have we received.  I don't know that we should use them if we had them, but the courtesy of the privilege would count for something, if the press of eastern states have been ignored as the Herald has been no wonder you have taken Mr. Rosewater to task sharply and that other papers have joined in.  This is not written to find fault, but simply to give you a sample of how the press is served.  Yours,</p>

                            <p>The records prove that the facts have been absolutely misrepresented at one end or the other of the line.  The following letter, mailed to the Herald by Mr. Rosewater as manager of the Department of Publicity and Promotion last May, is now on file at the department:</p>
                            <p>OMAHA, May 25, 1898.&#8212;To the Editor of the Dubuque Herald:  Dear Sir:  On behalf of the Transmississippi and International Exposition I desire to assure you of the grateful appreciation of the liberal treatment received at the hands of the daily press.  As an acknowledgment of these favors, I am authorized to tender you a season admission ticket, good June to November, 1898, for your editor and another for his wife.</p>
                            <p>Please send us the name of your editor or proprietor, and the name of his wife or other lady who may accompany him, and the tickets will be forwarded.  If any of your editorial or reportorial staff would visit Omaha they will be furnished free admission tickets during their stay on application to the Department of Publicity, Bee building.

                            <p>Similar letters were sent at that time to the editors of all dailies and that this was duly received by the Herald is established by the fact on Monday of this week it was presented at the Department of Publicity by the authorized agent of that paper and accompanied by the following letter:</p>
                            <p>DUBUQUE, Ia., Aug. 13, 1898.&#8212;Mr. E. Rosewater:  Dear Sir:  The bearer, Alfred Herron, is our traveling agent.  If you can furnish him and his wife tickets to the exposition on account of the Herald please do so and oblige.  Yours truly,</p>

                            <p>The passes were issued as requested.</p>
                            <p>At a recent meeting of the Board of Directors Director Hibbard raised a question whether passes had been sent to the Lincoln Post and Independent, and attempted to convey the impression that these papers had been discriminated against on account of their populist tendencies.  Manager Rosewater was unable to recollect how many passes had been sent to these papers at that time, but on his return to his office he discovered that four season passes had been sent to the Post and two season passes to the Independent, thus effectually disposing of this contention also.</p>
                            <p>Among many similar letters received by the Publicity department expressing thanks for courtesies extended, the following which arrived yesterday is a good sample:</p>
                            <p>OMAHA, Aug. 17.&#8212;E. Rosewater, Manager Department of Publicity:  Dear Sir:  In returning the pass extended to me, on account of the Boonville (Mo.) Advertiser, I wish to thank the exposition directors for their generous compliments and favors to the press outside the state of Nebraska.  I wish, also, to say that the exposition has been to me a source of great interest, education and entertainment.  That it is a marvel of success is beyond question.  The pluck, confidence, courage of the people of Omaha and Nebraska are, indeed, remarkable.  People who have not seen its beauty, on Court of Honor and Lagoon, with the States buildings, Midway, and fine exhibits, cannot, possibly, have even a <choice><sic>measureable</sic><corr>measurable</corr></choice> idea of it.</p>
                            <p>Again thanking the directors, through you, sir, I beg to subscribe myself a greatly appreciated admirer of the exposition.</p>

                                <p>In spite of the fact that the strong lines between Chicago and St. Paul have made an open reduction of fares of $3.50 the situation, so far as scalping is concerned, is said to be no better.  While the railroads were selling tickets at the normal rate of $11.50 the brokers were supplying them to the public at about $8.  To prevent the broker from doing all of the business the strong lines cut their rate to $8.  Yesterday the brokers were selling at $5 and $6. &#8212;Chicago Times-Herald.</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>Where did the brokers get these tickets and how are they able, whatever rates the railroads openly announced and put in, to sell tickets, according to distance and starting and destination points, at from $1 to $10 less than such rates?</p>
                            <p>Are the railroads receiving and carrying passengers between Chicago and St. Paul on tickets printed by the brokers?</p>
                            <p>The fact of the matter is, and every railroad man and every business man who has investigated the matter knows it, that the railroads, not only between St. Paul and Chicago, but the railroads all over the country, have been for years and are doing business with the brokers directly; that they are selling tickets at reduced rates direct to the brokers, and that they are having brokers sell tickets for them on commission.</p>
                            <p>Every railroad man in the country knows that if the railroads were honest and in earnest in their fight against the brokers, that they could, within thirty days, make the business of ticket brokerage or "scalping" so unprofitable as to drive the brokers out of business.  Without the direct support and business of the railroad companies the broker could not continue in business.</p>
                            <p>The railroads have been refusing to give Omaha reduced rates to the exposition and have declared that if Omaha would close up the ticket scalpers' offices that the rates would be given.  A bluff inspired by the railroads, and which it was known at the time would be promptly called by the ticket brokers, was made in the form of an ordinance introduced and passed under false pretenses by the city council.  At the same time that this was being done the railroads were selling tickets to Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and other points direct to the brokers, and at such rates that after keeping a fair profit for himself the broker could still sell the tickets at 10 or more per cent less than the open and announced rate.</p>
                            <p>The failure of the ordinance to drive the ticket brokers out of business has been officially given by the chairman of the Western Passenger association and the officials of local roads as the reason for not giving reduced rates to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>When the railroads make an honest effort to drive the brokers out of business and stop doing business with the brokers it will be time enough to make the broker an excuse for not giving reduced rates to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The officials of the Western Passenger association and the railroads entering Omaha have deceived the press and people of this city regarding the rates which they proposed to put in, and regarding meetings of the association.  They are attempting to deceive the press and people of this city when they declare that reduced rates are not given on account of the ticket brokers.</p>

The cash receipts at the gates for the day were $6,002.75.  In view of the fact that the evening <choice><sic>admisisons</sic><corr>admissions</corr></choice> on days without special evening attractions are merely nominal the reduced rate was responsible for another "pick-up" of $1,500 as compared with one of $1,000 on the reduced rates evenings a week ago.</p>
                            <p>The big crowd was a busy one, and it was orderly and good-natured.  In the main it spent money freely, although it was remarked by the ticket sellers that a fair percentage of those who stepped up to the windows to buy tickets were people of limited means, and that it was apparent in many cases that the quarter for <choice><sic>admisison</sic><corr>admission</corr></choice> was about all they had to spend.</p>
                            <p>Information as to the lack of advertising and proper railroad rates in the east continues to pour in upon the management.  A letter was received yesterday from McCourteny Betz of Unionport, O., near Steubenville, on the Pan-Handle road, asking for information.  The writer said in part:  "We cannot learn much about the exposition here.  There is no publication or advertisement about it in our papers.  Railroads say nothing about it.  Got no reduced rates.  Lots of people would attend from here if cheaper than usual rates could be had."</p>

                            <p>Another new Indian baby has put in an appearance on the exposition grounds, and it is already settled that it shall go through life under the cognomen of Little Congress Tyndall.  The Indian name will not be hitched on for some time, as Indian names are not chosen without reason and are not decided on hastily.</p>
                            <p>The parents of the little one are Christopher and Edith Tyndall, and the father is a grandson of Logan Fontenelle, the old chief of the Omahas, who nearly a century ago signed the treaty ceding this vast section to the whites, and who was buried on the bluffs overlooking the river within a few miles of the exposition grounds.  Tyndall is not a full blooded Indian, but his wife is an Omaha squaw, and <choice><sic>canont</sic><corr>cannot</corr></choice> talk English.  Tyndall is a graduate of the Indian school at Carlisle, and has acquired considerable property.</p>
                            <p>Dr. George L. Miller is not inclined to accept the responsibility of taking up the publicity feature of the exposition at this late day, but when urged to lend his efforts toward giving the east some information regarding the great show he stated that he would definitely advise President Wattles this morning.  The executive committee came to the conclusion that something would have to be done to provide for the situation that exists, and at once concluded to send Colonel F. A. Key, the artist who has been engaged for some time in painting views of the grounds, on a trip east, to see the publishers of the magazines and art publications relative to publishing some pictorial matter in this connection.</p>

                            <p>Manager Rosewater had insisted on going out for this purpose, but when Dr. Miller intimated his disinclination to co-operate with him Mr. Rosewater dropped the hot end of the poker and started for Washington to give birth to the peace jubilee.  The executive committee had already decided on the jubilee and fixed the time for it as the week of October 9 to 15, and had instructed President Wattles to take up the matter with President McKinley with a view to securing the presence of the chief executive and his cabinet.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater immediately realized that there was only one man who was fitted for a job like this, and started out to do the inviting himself.  As he was chasing madly to the train he was headed off by an enterprising Bee reporter and asked to submit to an interview.  Mr. Rosewater stated that he was constitutionally opposed to talking for publication, but the reporter, at the point of an exclamation, backed him up an alley and tapped him with a corkscrew.</p>

                            <p>"Now don't ask me anything of a personal nature," said Mr. Rosewater, "because I don't like to talk about myself.  The public is, of course, interested in what I think and do and say, but life is too short to tell them all about it."</p>
                            <p>"How about the exposition?" queried the reporter.</p>
                            <p>"What did I tell you," demanded Mr. Rosewater.  "I don't want to be everlastingly talking about myself.  Who originated the exposition?  Who built it?  Who has made it what it is?  Who is the exposition anyway?  I have put in some of the hardest work of my life building this monument of my closing years.  I know some people have maliciously sought to deprive me of the credit, but that don't go as long as I am on top of earth.  Now then, I want to talk about something less personal."</p>
                            <p>"Do you think the Indian congress is a success?" ventured the interrogator.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WHO AM I, ANYWAY?</head>
                            <p>"Well, you are the most cheerful idiot I have seen in several days," asseverated Mr. Rosewater with some feeling.  "Who brought that Indian congress here, anyway?  Whose idea was it in the first place?  Who got the appropriation through congress?  You might as well ask me whether I am a success or not/"</p>
                            <p>"How will the close of the war affect the country?" asked the perturbed Bee emissary, striking wildly at long range.</p>
                            <p>For a full minute naught broke the silence but the hoarse, abdominal breathing of Mr. Rosewater, as he gazed on the shrinking figure before him.  "Don't you know that I am going to Washington to arrange for that very thing?" he thundered in dulcet tones.  "Who was war?  Who is peace?  For your personal information let me stat that you are gazing on the genuine article in the original package.  Now, if you are not in search of knowledge on general topics, get out of my road, for I am not disposed to devote all my time to talking about myself."</p>
                            <p>The reporter ignominiously fled and Mr. Rosewater is speeding to Washington as fast as steam will take him.</p>
                            <p>The McCook band will be here Monday, for one week.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Waterhouse of Washington university, St. Louis, and Hon. J. R. Rippey, secretary of the Missouri state board of agriculture and member of the state commission, are taking in the exposition.  Both are enthusiastic in their expressions of admiration and approval.  Prof. Waterhouse is especially interested in introducing the new fiber ramie.</p>
                            <p>James Devaney, an employe at one of the Midway concessions, showed up at the hospital yesterday, looking for treatment.  He speedily developed a lively case of "snakes," and, after showing the hospital attaches a hot time for a few minutes, took his departure.  He later reappeared armed with a bottle of whisky, and wanted to be friendly, but the patrol wagon was called, and he was sent to the city jail.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee has found it necessary to return to the plan of holding daily meetings, as the grist that accumulates in two days requires too long a session.  At yesterday's meeting S. C. Bassett of Gibbon was appointed to assist Superintendent Dinsmore in the dairy department, and H. G. F. Wert of Auburn was placed in charge of the poultry exhibit.</p>
                            <p>A program of races and other sports has been arranged for the Indian camp tomorrow.  No admission will be charged.  A fireworks display will take place in the evening on the north tract.</p>

The question of the 25-cent rate was discussed at length, and the concessionaires all expressed great disappointment at the refusal of the directors to put the rate into effect.

For the number on the grounds yesterday forenoon was larger than on any day except a big day since the exposition opened.</p>
                            <p>The Texas day exercises were held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock and were listened to by 1,000 people.</p>
                            <p>Governor Culberson and his staff and company entered the building while the Musical Union band of this city played a patriotic medley.</p>

                            <p>Vice President Johnson for the state of Texas, presided.  Without prelude he introduced Acting Governor Harris of Nebraska, who delivered an address of welcome on behalf of the state.  He described Texas as one of the giant daughters of Uncle Sam.  It gave him great pleasure to welcome the <choice><sic>distinquished</sic><corr>distinguished</corr></choice> guests from what would one day be one of the most prosperous bits of territory on the face of the earth.  His reference to the disappearance of sectionalism on the battlefields of the war just closed was loudly applauded.</p>

                            <p>Governor Culberson was tendered quite an ovation when he rose to respond.  He said that it was a great satisfaction to him and his companions to be here and they would take back the pleasantest recollections of the hospitality and courtesies of this day.  He declared that the interests binding Nebraska and Texas together should bring the people of the two states into still closer fellowship.  He said that they had come to offer encouragement in the great enterprise, which save for the Centennial and the World's fair, had had no rival in America.  It was pre-eminently an illustration of the agricultural resources of the country and emphasized the imperative need of more extended markets.  And in this connection he described the advantages of deep water harbors nearer to the section comprising the middle west and northwest.  Nebraska people could do nothing better than to assist in securing these deep harbors on the coast of Texas.  Indeed the deep water had already been secured and Texas wanted Nebraska to take advantage of it.</p>
                            <p>But with deep water and low rates secured, the governor added, the whole battle for the west and southwest would not be won.  It would be necessary to remove the <choice><sic>emburgo</sic><corr>embargo</corr></choice> on goods brought into this country and commercial freedom, he declared, was as certain as American destiny was manifest.</p>

He highly commended the exhibit made by the state and returned the thanks of the exposition management to the people of Texas for their public spirit and the encouragement they had given to the great fair.  One of the first letters backing up the exposition was received from Tom Richardson of Texas who had promised that if the gates were opened Texas would be here.</p>

Our organization is Scottish in design, and our costumes are all of the Highlander character, and attractive, and when we parade through Omaha one will fancy a Highland army marching through the streets.  We want to make a fine display, and I am here now to arrange for it.  There is one strong lodge of our order in Omaha and another in South Omaha, and they will turn out to a man.

The fact that arrangements for the concert were not made until Monday night and it was not as fully advertised as previous ones have been, no doubt cut down the attendance.  But the audience made up in enthusiasm what it lacked in numbers.  Miss Durno plays with a great deal of feeling.  She has made a careful study of the composers whom she interprets and her technique is excellent.  She was repeatedly encored.  Mr. Pollock possesses a rich lyric tenor voice which greatly delighted the audience, who recalled him each time he sang.</p>

                            <p>The Chicago Times-Herald of Thursday morning contained this item:</p>
                            <p>"A round-trip rate of $10 has been suggested as the proper charge for the railroads to make between Chicago and Omaha on account of Chicago day at the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  Most of the railroad men are anxious that Chicago should make a good showing on that occasion, and many Chicagoans are as deeply interested as the railroad men.  For some weeks there has been more or less talk about low rates for the occasion, but the matter did not take definite shape until yesterday.  Then General Passenger Agent Heafford of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul sent a letter to Chairman Caldwell of the Western Passenger association, <choice><sic>sugesting</sic><corr>suggesting</corr></choice> that round-trip tickets be sold for $10 and that they be good for three days.  It is the idea to place them on sale here Friday, September 30, and have the return portions good on any trains arriving here Monday or Tuesday following.  The proposition will be submitted to the interested lines, and it is probable that it will be adopted.  The present one-way rate between Chicago and Omaha is $9.25, a reduction below normal of $3.50."</p>
                            <p>At the local office of the <choice><sic>iMlwaukee</sic><corr>Milwaukee</corr></choice> road last evening it was stated that no official announcement of the rate had been or could yet be given. as no action will be taken until after the next meeting of the Western Passenger association.  The opinion was expressed, however, that a $10 rate, tickets to have a short return limit of not to exceed three days would be made, either with or without the approval of the association.</p>
                            <p>During every day of the Nashville exposition, with return limit of seven days, round-trip tickets were sold at as proportionately low a rate from Chicago to Nashville as is the $10 round trip rate from Chicago to Omaha, and on special days still lower rates were given.  In other words the special low rate proposed for Chicago day at the Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha is within 10 per cent of the regular rate given from April 29, 1897, to October 26, 1897, inclusive, from Chicago to the Tennessee Centennial at Nashville.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>A meeting of the board of directors was scheduled for yesterday afternoon, but the roll call showed the presence of one less than a quorum.  Several matters were informally discussed, before an adjournment was taken until 4 o'clock Monday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The first matter that occupied the attention of the directors was a copy of Leslie's Weekly, dated August 25.  Mr. Rosewater had announced at a former meeting that this number was to contain an illustrated article on the exposition, and the directors were immensely pleased to find such to be the case.  At the top of the column, next to pure reading matter, appeared the following brilliant and exhaustive write-up of the exposition:</p>
                            <quote>
                                <p>One of the brainiest and successful self-made men of the west is Mr. Edward C. Rosewater of Omaha.  He first thought of a Trans-Mississippi exposition.  He brought it about, and was chiefly instrumental in making a success of a stupendous enterprise born in the midst of financial depression and built up during a period when every forward step was a struggle against adverse conditions.  Mr. Rosewater began his business career as a telegraph operator at Murfreesboro, Tenn.  During the civil war he was attached to the staff of General Pope for military telegraph service, and was later assigned to the war department at Washington.  During this period he met President Lincoln, and the two became close friends.  On January 1, 1863, Mr. Rosewater w<unclear reason="torn"/> transmit the original emancipation proclamation from the president to the army.  He is also famous for the part he played in securing a postal telegraphic service.  Several years ago, at the request of Postmaster General Wanamaker, he made a personal investigation of the postal telegraph systems of England, Germany, France and Austria, and was the sole American representative at the postal telegraph congress in 1897.  He is the proprietor and founder of the Omaha Bee, one of the most powerful newspapers of the Trans-Mississippi region.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION IN PERSONA.</head>
                            <p>Alongside the graphic word-painting of the beauty and immensity of the great show appeared an excellent cut of the exposition personified.  It looked for all the world like Mr. Rosewater, and the editor of the publication had quite naturally made the mistake of placing underneath it the words, "Mr. Edward C. Rosewater," instead of attaching to it the proper label of "Bird's-eye view of the Transmississippi and International exposition."</p>
                            <p>The eastern readers of that journal might have failed to see the resemblance, but to those acquainted with the general situation on the grounds, it was all brought out with the minuteness of detail that marked the true artists.  Unmistakable traces of the Midway appeared about the eyes, while the clothes had a suggestion of government property about them that could hardly fail to bring to mind the congressional appropriation and the federal exhibit.  The nose was a faithful reproduction of the most noticeable features of International hall, and the broad expanse of alabaster brow was a most realistic portrayal of the brains and genius that have wrested his birthright from the savage and reared a monument to progressive civilization in the western empire.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THE STATES REPRESENTED.</head>
                            <p>The artistic composition was full of suggestions and significant features.  Hidden in the mouth back of the drooping moustache, were supposed to be twenty-four teeth, typical of the twenty-four states and territories of the Trans-Mississippi region, and the power and varied resources of those commonwealths was supposed to be symbolized by the rapidity, frequency and variety with which Mr. Rosewater spits words through that same moustache at the meetings of the official board of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>As the directors looked at the beautiful picture and read and reread the splendid rhetoric in which the grandeur and completeness of the exposition were set forth, they admitted that they were ashamed of themselves for having reached a conclusion that the show was not being adequately advertised in the east.</p>
                            <p>Colonel C. F. Weller allowed his first impulse to run away with him, however, and remarked:</p>
                            <p>"I don't believe Mr. Rosewater knew anything about that."</p>
                            <p>"Well," replied another director, "you remember that he told us that an illustrated article on the exposition was going to appear in this number, and this is the only reference to the exposition that I can find in it."</p>
                            <p>"I will say this," said Colonel Weller slowly, "if he did have anything to do with it, it is the greatest exhibition of egotism that I ever ran across in my life."</p>
                            <p>For this treasonable utterance Colonel Weller was promptly called down, and the directors began to congratulate each other in an informal way that the exposition was at last being placed before the people of the east in its proper light.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WHAT IT ADVERTISES.</head>
                            <p>No bill for the lengthy write-up has yet been received, and many of the directors believe that Mr. Rosewater will see to it that the advertisement is given free, as he is opposed to paying out the exposition's money to outside papers, and is endeavoring to secure the publication of these general articles about the exposition solely in the interest of the development of the west, the diffusion of important knowledge in the east, and the inflation of a boom for postmaster general in 1900.</p>
                            <p>The usual talk was indulged in by the directors relative to imposing a fine on members who failed to attend the meetings.  Mr. Lindsey suggested that something be done to advertise the exposition in the central states, Ohio, Indiana, etc.  He said that he heard considerable complaint about the situation there and he thought that attention might now be given to it, as it was evident from Leslie's Weekly that Mr. Rosewater was getting the east well in hand.</p>
                            <p>"Are we doing anything in the west?" demanded Colonel Weller.  "I understand that nothing is being done in Utah and those states, except what is done by the railroads."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Babcock admitted that this was true, except that three men had just been sent out among the trunk lines to put up posters and other advertising matter.  So far as the newspapers were concerned, however, there was little or nothing being printed except what was put in the papers by the railroads.</p>

                            <head type="sub">RATE FROM ST. LOUIS.</head>
                            <p>Colonel Weller then asked about St. Louis rates, and said he was informed that the rate was about $15, which the people down there thought too high, and which by no means was as low as was given for Omaha people to visit the fair at St. Louis.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Babcock said the matter would come up next Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Carpenter wanted to know about the peace jubilee, and was informed by President Wattles that he had appointed a committee consisting of Senators Thurston and Allen and ex-Senator Manderson and Congressman Mercer, who would take up the matter with President McKinley on September 3, and Senator Thurston was of the opinion that his presence could be secured at that time.  It was on his suggestion that the time of the jubilee was fixed for the second week in October.</p>

                            <p>Commissioners Armstrong of Spokane and Roudebeck of Everett arrived yesterday with the first carload of the Washington mineral exhibit.  The second car is expected in a day or two.  The exhibit will be installed by the middle of next week on the 512 square feet reserved for it in the northwest corner of the Mines and Mining <choice><sic>bilding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>An acrobat at the German Village suffered a severe fall yesterday while attempting a new turn, and landed on his knee.  The flesh was torn to the bone and the knee cap badly bruised.  He will be laid up for a couple of weeks.</p>
                            <p>Commissioners Markley and Packard are crowding plans to bring in a large number of bands on Iowa day.  A number of musical aggregations from various parts of the state have already signified their intention of being present.</p>
                            <p>President Sterrett of the Missouri commission is hopeful that the action of the Missouri Pacific will result in suitable rates being obtained for visitors from that section, and, in anticipation of this, is ready to move for a resetting of Missouri day, the former plan of having a state day having been given up some time ago on account of the lack of rates.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Dinsmore of the live stock department came in yesterday, and <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> begin work next week on the construction of the necessary pens.  He has already received over 100 entries, representing over 500 animals, and says he has received assurances that nearly all the states will be on hand in this line.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday's paid attendance numbered about 7,500, of whom 6,892 entered the grounds before 3 o'clock, and few of whom came in after 7 o'clock.  It was a day crowd, and the grounds were deserted at an early hour.</p>

                            <p>Thursday, August 25, there will be a grand grape gathering festival at Fritz Mueller's Schlitz Pavilion, under the management of John Gradl, and hundreds of invitations have been sent to people all over the country.  At 6 o'clock the grand entry of the officials Bunzlau will take place.  After 7 o'clock there will be a social hop.  The whole establishment will be turned into a vineyard and every participant will imagine herself in the vineyards of Austria.  The Blaufass orchestra and the Reibachers' Tyrolean Warblers will assist in the festival.  On this special occasion there will be served genuine imported Rhine wine, champagne, cognac and other fine drinks.  A number of prizes will be offered in various contests.  The most valuable prize will be a lady's gold watch.  People who have heard of this event are looking forward with bright anticipation to a royal good time.</p>
                            <p>Miss Seamon of St. Louis lost four diamond rings yesterday, valued at $2,000.  In two hours after the young woman missed her property she was notified that it had been found and cared for by Fritz Mueller, proprietor of Schlitz Pavilion.</p>
                            <p>There was a joyous time in the Streets of All Nations Thursday, the birthday of three of the most beautiful dancers of the Midway, La Bell Rosa, Carmen and Fatima.  The occasion was celebrated in royal style after the Greek custom.  At midnight these three beauties entertained all the inhabitants of the noted concession.  They treated their friends to special performances in the Streets, after which an invitation was extended to a wine supper which was most elaborate and tempting.  On Shriners' day Mr. Akoun, proprietor of the Streets of All Nations, will entertain the nobles of the great order with special performances, concluding with a grand battle of confetti.</p>
                            <p>Henry Willard, proprietor of Pabst on the Midway, acted very strangely yesterday.  Now and then there was a curious, pleasant-like smile on his face, but at intervals he was in deep thought.  The mystery was explained when he started home at noon laden down with all kinds of baby clothes.  It is a girl and weighs eight and one-half pounds.  This is the first Midway baby and Mr. and Mrs. Willard have received hundreds of congratulations.  The child has been named Alice Helen.</p>

                            <p>Rural visitors are constantly mistaking the Chutes for the Giant See-Saw and the Scenic Railway.  Yesterday two gentlemen from Iowa stood near the three attractions discussing their merits. They recognized each, or at least one of them did, though he got mixed in names.  "John," pointing to the See-saw, "this is the Shooting the Chutes, let's shoot."  "No, it ain't nuther, its the teeter, totter and I'll be gosh darned if I teet on that thar thing."</p>
                            <p>The management of the Birth of Our Nation, having found it absolutely impossible to arouse and interest regarding the early settlement of this country, has sold to W. W. Coates, concession to be converted into a first-class restaurant.</p>
                            <p>There was a serious accident at the Wild West show last night and the large audience witnessing the performance at the time sat, amazed, watching the result.  The race between Mexicans, Indians, cowboys and ladies was nearing the close when the sorrel horse ridden by Green Rainbard, in the lead, stumbled and fell, with the rider underneath.  All the other riders passed by except Ed Berger, a cowboy.  His horse, Crumnal, was at a high rate of speed and ran into the Indian's horse, throwing Berger twenty feet.  Both men were picked up, and carried off the arena.  They were badly injured though no bones were broken.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Movement Set Afoot to Secure the Minnesota State Building for Riverview Park.</head>
                            <p>The purchase of the Minnesota state building at the exposition by the South Side Improvement club of this city and its removal with all its tasty furnishings to Riverview park, are matters now under serious consideration.</p>
                            <p>The subject has been quietly discussed among a number of the citizens of the First and Second wards for several weeks, but the movement found its official expression at the meeting of the South Side Improvement club, at Tenth and Hickory streets, last evening.  At that time the following resolutions were introduced by Dr. W. H. Hanchett and unanimously carried:</p>
                            <p>Be it resolved by the South Side Improvement club, That, whereas, Riverview park, although the most beautiful park in the city, has no place for shelter in case of storm; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The Minnesota building, one of the most unique, picturesque and substantial buildings on the exposition grounds, is well adapted architecturally to the natural forest and overhanging bluffs of Riverview park; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, There is no money in the park funds of the city of Omaha that can be used for the purpose of providing a pavilion in Riverview park; therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That E. J. Cornish, Ernest Stuht and John Powers be appointed a committee to ascertain upon what terms said building can be acquired and the cost of removing the same to Riverview park; and that if the expense is not found too great this club will undertake to raise a fund for the purpose by voluntary contributions of its members and public-spirited citizens.</p>
                            <p>There was a large attendance at the meeting, which was presided over by the president of the club, John Powers.  Considerable discussion of ways and means of securing the building followed the introduction of the resolution.

                                <p>Nobody but a fool talks about clubbing the railroads into granting desired excursion rates to the exposition.  There is no call for clubs, but what is needed is to show the railroad rate makers that in helping the exposition they help themselves.  The railroad men are intelligent business men and they cannot fail to realize the attention.&#8212;Omaha Bee.</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>It was to be expected that the Bee would rush to the defense of the men who are imposing upon Omaha in the matter of railroad rates.  "What is needed," says the Bee, "is to show the railroad rate makers that in helping the exposition they help themselves."  The trouble is that the railroad rate makers, Caldwell &amp; Co., have no concern for the welfare of the exposition and are influenced more by the railroads of the eastern and middle states, who fear to encourage visits to this great western country by the people living along their lines lest those people be captivated by this section and influenced to settle here.  It is in the power of the representatives of the local companies to break away from the Caldwell decree and give Omaha decent rates by independent action, but for some reason they have not shown the disposition to do so.  There has been enough intelligent demonstration to "show" these local representatives that reasonable railroad rates while helping the exposition would help the companies they represent.  This showing has been sufficient even if every one of these local representatives, his father, his grandfather, his great-grandfather and his great-great-grandfather were born or bred in Missouri.  If these railroad men are "intelligent business men and they cannot fail to realize the situation," how does it happen that they have not realized the situation long ago?</p>
                            <p>For the last two years the fact that there would be a Trans-Mississippi exposition has been dinned into the ears of these men.</p>
                            <p>Eighty-one days ago the exposition opened and it is pronounced by every one who visits it as second&#8212;in importance and beauty&#8212;only to the World's fair.  And yet during all this time, while the people of Omaha and Nebraska were straining every nerve to make the enterprise the success which its greatness deserves, the railroad "rate makers" have accorded it no favors and the local representatives of the railroads have not shown sufficient independence and enterprise to stand up for the interests of the section upon which their own roads depend for support.  During all this time the business men of Omaha, the exposition directors and the newspapers have reasoned and pleaded with these gentlemen for justice to Omaha in the matter of railroad rates.</p>

                            <p>But it is an insult to the intelligence of these gentlemen to say that they need a demonstration of a plain commercial fact.</p>
                            <p>It is an insult to the intelligence of these gentlemen to say that they are so blind they cannot see that in helping the exposition they are helping the roads that depend for existence upon the Trans-Mississippi country.</p>
                            <p>It is an insult to the intelligence of these gentlemen to say that at this time when the exposition is more than half completed they are yet ignorant of the importance of reasonable railroad rates to Omaha, to the exposition and to the Trans-Mississippi section.</p>
                            <p>These men are not blind.  They are much more intelligent than their cheap newspaper apologist would make them out.  They are simply dominated and controlled by the high mogul of the Western Passenger association, whose decree they are perfectly able to veto, but in whose imperial presence they are afraid to stand up for the interests of the section upon which they depend for support.</p>
                            <p>For years Omaha has tried the policy of pleading and entreaty, and it has been repeatedly demonstrated that that is an almighty poor policy.  Omaha has lost, and in the losing other cities have gained, several conventions, several large gatherings, simply because Omaha could not obtain reasonable railroad rates.  These are irretrievable losses.  They cannot be remedied by anything which the rate makers may do in the future, yet in the face of these losses&#8212;aside from the action of the Missouri Pacific and Port Arthur route&#8212;no disposition has been shown upon the part of local roads to break away from the Caldwell decree.</p>
                            <p>The policy of pleading and entreaty may be pursued and the result will be that the exposition gates will close without any material improvement in the situation.</p>
                            <p>The policy of pleading and entreaty may be persisted in and Omaha will continue to lose important gatherings because of unreasonable railroad rates.  The people of Omaha have given to the policy of pleading and entreaty a full and complete trial.  That policy has been a complete failure.  Now the people of Omaha will abandon that policy and will adopt measures that will result in securing justice to Omaha in more than one respect.</p>

                            <p>The end of the week finds excursionists coming into Omaha to see the exposition in almost as large numbers as at its beginning.  This morning the arrival of the trains on the various roads was indicated by visible booms in street car traffic, and most of the arrivals were apparently heading for the grounds without stopping to provide themselves with down-town quarters.  Many of the excursionists consisted of family and neighborhood parties from adjacent  towns, whose burdens of lunch baskets indicated that they were in merely for a day's holiday, but with them came hundreds of people whose luggage proclaimed that they proposed to see the whole show before they left.</p>
                            <p>After dinner there was a marked increase in local attendance on account of the big celebration at the Indian encampment this afternoon.  This will be in several respects the most interesting exhibition of the sort that has been given on the grounds.  The program includes races of all sorts, as well as some of the most interesting dances.  The Indians are delighted to participate in this sort of amusement as a happy diversion from the monotony of their camp life, and there is no hippodroming in any of the events.  Every buck goes in to win and the rivalry between the members of the different tribes is intense.  The show is entirely free to exposition visitors, and it will be wound up with a big dance this evening.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Center of Attraction at the Government Building.</head>
                            <p>The four-inch breech-loading rapid fire gun that was recently secured for the naval exhibit in the Government building has been placed in position and receives more than ordinary attention from visitors.  As this is by far the most pretentious piece of ordnance that has ever been seen in this part of the transmississippi region it impresses the bulk of the visitors as a most formidable piece of fighting machinery.  The gun is thirteen feet long and is capable of accurate execution at a range of more than five miles.  While it is far from carrying the tremendous force of the bigger guns, it is said to be fully capable of penetrating the armor of anything except one of the heavily protected battleships.  It represents the medium gun that has done the most effective execution in the late naval encounters and is altogether a very interesting piece of fighting mechanism.</p>
                            <p>To people who are only familiar with the old-fashioned cannon that were used in previous wars the modern ordnance displays some new and interesting features.  The big gun is swung on a <choice><sic>carraige</sic><corr>carriage</corr></choice> geared with cogs by which the muzzle is readily turned in any direction by cranks that move with a slight pressure.  Just at the left of the breech is a small wheel which has the various ranges marked on it and above it is a small telescope through which the sighting is done.  When the range is transmitted to the gun captain the wheel is turned until the indicator touches the figure mentioned and it is only the work of a few seconds to manipulate the gun so that when it is discharged the projectile will strike at exactly that distance.</p>
                            <p>Another interesting feature is the breech mechanism and the adjustments by which the tremendous recoil incident to the use of huge explosive energy is regulated.  The breech plug screws into the breech of the gun, but it is so nicely adjusted that one turn of a lever unscrews it and opens it to the right to admit the insertion of the projectile.  There is also the breech mechanism of a thirteen-inch gun, which indicates what a mammoth weapon the entire rifle would be.  The breach alone w<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The pronounced success of the Texas day exercises has been the means of stirring up a good deal of southern enthusiasm over exposition matters and the men who came from the Lone Star state are now in line with the officials in another effort to make a big demonstration of the occasion of the Peace Jubilee.</p>
                            <p>General Passenger Agent E. J. Martin and Assistant General Passenger Agent George F. Lupton of the San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass railway company, after visiting all parts of the exposition yesterday, expressed themselves as being highly pleased with everything both inside and outside of the buildings.  They called upon President Wattles and other exposition officials and suggested the propriety of holding a great north and south hand shaking carnival during the week of the Peace Jubilee in October, which is expected to bring together all the prominent men of the nation.  The exposition officials regarded the proposition with much favor and steps will be taken by the Texans to co-operate with the exposition committee to secure the attendance of President McKinley and all of the members of his cabinet, as well as the heroes of the recent Spanish-American war.  Such men as General Fitzhugh Lee, Joe Wheeler and others from the south, together with Generals Miles, Shafter and numerous others who are prominent in the army and navy will be invited.  If the plan is worked up, ex-Governor Lubbeck, ex-Governor Hubbard, Judge J. H. Reagan and many other prominent Texans will be here to grasp the hands of such well known northern men as ex-Governor Saunders of Nebraska and General Lew Wallace of Indiana.  Ex-Governor Northen of Georgia will join and bring a large southern contingent from his home and surrounding states.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee Postpones Its Meeting Until Monday Afternoon.</head>
                            <p>Twenty-five members of the Board of Directors struggled for nearly two hours yesterday afternoon to secure the additional member that was necessary to make a quorum.  Then they gave it up and adjourned to 4 o'clock Monday.  While they were waiting, the members indulged in some informal discussion on various topics.  One of these related to the propriety of holding evening meetings in order to secure a larger attendance.  The majority of those present held, however, that they would be worse off in the evening than in the afternoon, and the suggestion was voted down.</p>
                            <p>Manager Lindsey wanted to know what was being done to advertise the exposition in Ohio and Indiana, and another member asked if anything was being done in the west.  Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation, who is looking after the Department of Publicity during Manager Rosewater's absence, stated that three advertising men had been sent out over the trunk lines west of Omaha to see that the country was thoroughly billed for 500 miles, and he also gave some information in regard to the work that was being done by the railroads in the way of co-operation with the Department of Publicity.</p>
                            <p>C. F. Weller suggested that the exposition was now getting a tremendous amount of advertising in the newspapers.  He had got hold of a big bundle of papers from various localities only the other day, and without an exception they devoted a considerable amount of space to the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Horticultural Building Takes on New Life with Their Visit.</head>
                            <p>Under ordinary circumstances Friday would have been an off day in the Horticultural building, but knowing that the florists were to pay the place a visit, the exhibitors did their best to shine up their fruit and have everything ready for inspection.  There were crowds of people in the building all of the time, but the big rush came when the florists and their friends put in an appearance.</p>
                            <p>Illinois got to the front yesterday and put on exhibition some ten varieties of new pears and a big lot of apples and peaches.  Just now the state seems to be devoting its energies to making a great display of pears, and all of the orchardists are sending in large quantities.  One of the long tables originally intended for apples has been turned over to the pear exhibitors, who have used up most of the space thus allotted.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska has beautified one of its tables by having several ornamental designs worked out in small fruits.  The designs are in the form of wheels, circles and things of that kind, while the centers are filled with bouquets of sweet peas and geraniums.  On the outside of the designs there are large plates filled with grapes, crab apples and berries.  The state has struck something else that is new.  Superintendent Youngers has skirmished around and has made a collection of hazel nuts and chestnuts which he takes much pride in show<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Kansas has added to its horticultural exhibit largely within the last few days, and is now showing some of the finest grapes, apples and peaches that have been seen since the fruit commenced to come into the building.</p>
                            <p>For the purpose of keeping in the front ranks, Superintendent Wilson of the Southern California exhibit has sent on and has secured a lot of new fruit from Bishop &amp; Co., who reside near his home in Los Angeles.  The shipment arrived yesterday and contained crystallized fruit, the first shown.  The preparing of this fruit in California, Superintendent Wilson says, is a new industry, and until three years ago the process was unknown.  Even now the method of preparing the fruit is a secret, known only to the fruiter who puts out the product.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the orange crop of California has been reported short, Superintendent Wilson says that he will show new citrous fruit until the close of the exposition, and that instead of his exhibit growing smaller, it will increase.</p>

                            <p>The florists had things their own way on the exposition grounds yesterday.  They journeyed out at about 11 o'clock and proceed to the Horticultural building, where Prof. Taylor had done some special decorating in honor of their visit.  Flags were hung from the ceiling and the plants had been pruned, washed and brightened up.  After inspecting the building they strayed to the flower beds on the Bluff tract and then admired the aquatic plants in the pool.  Just before noon they all congregated at the Nebraska building, where they were welcomed by President Wattles of the exposition, who dwelt at length upon what had been accomplished in building up an exposition second to none ever held in this or any other country.  He was followed by Messrs. Clarkson and Taylor in five minute speeches.</p>
                            <p>On behalf of the visiting florists Mr. Hammond of New York responded, saying that the convention had been profitable and enjoyable.  He spoke of the exposition, saying that it is something that will remain as a monument to the men who conceived and builded it.  He compared it with others and said it is equaled only by the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>After the conclusion of the speaking the florists adjourned to Markel's restaurant, where covers had been laid for 200.  The dinner that followed was served in courses and after it was finished A. Donaghue, sr., of Omaha, presented William Scott of Buffalo, N. Y., with a gold medal for having made the highest average in the bowling contest.</p>

Through the interest taken by the Commercial club of Wichita the county is already fairly represented by samples of wheat, corn, potatoes and other farm products, but since some of the citizens of that locality have visited the exposition they have gone home to begin a vigorous crusade for a more extensive exhibit.  The result is a determination to send a new and more exhaustive exhibit, and Pat Healy of Wichita has been selected by the Commercial club to accompany a carload of agricultural and manufactured products that are being rapidly collected.</p>

                            <p>Great preparations are being made for the observance of Iowa days, which will be September 20-21, and unless the predictions of the Iowa commissioners go for naught, one of the biggest crowds ever seen upon the exposition grounds will be here to participate in the exercises.  The program has not yet been prepared, but it is being worked out by ex-Governor Packard and Commissioner Markley and it is pretty certain that music and oratory will be two of the prominent features.  Two of the speakers, Governor Shaw and Congressman Cousins, have been named and it is possible that there will be others.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the music, at this time it seems probable that there will be bands from about every county in the state and that they will all join in a big parade.  Commissioner Markley is working up the musical features and he writes ex-Governor Packard that the bands from Cerro Gordo, Howard, Iowa, Marshal, Hardin and Worth counties will be in attendance and that almost daily other musical organizations are sending in notice that they will be on hand to help make the two days a couple of hummers.</p>
                            <p>In order not to have the huge parade an unwieldy thing, it will be divided into divisions, which will be made up from the organizations of the respective congressional districts, each division to be in charge of a marshal.</p>

                            <p>The farmers and producers of the western states who have deferred their visits until their absence from home would not interfere with the work in the fields will find in the exposition the first full realization of their own productive power.  This was one of the original objects of the projectors, and it can not fail to have a most wholesome effect.</p>
                            <p>A second object of the exposition, namely, to impress upon visitors from more distant points the promise held forth by the transmississippi region as a field for profitable investment, must from now on come more in the foreground.  As a factor in the upbuilding of the western states, the exposition is bound to be felt long after the gates shall have been closed and the last vestiges of the beautiful buildings disappeared.</p>
                            <p>Already the exposition has drawn the attention of hundreds of thousands to the west who would otherwise have remained in ignorance of its unexampled energies and magnificent possibilities.  As knowledge gained from personal inspection always counts for most, in bringing eastern people into the heart of the transmississippi country lies the exposition's greatest power for permanent good.</p>
                            <p>The swell of the tide toward the exposition emphasizes anew the responsibilities resting upon the people of this city and state to provide for the visiting guests and make sure that they do not go away disappointed.  Omaha is fully awake to the situation and its citizens may be relied on to do their whole duty.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">THE PLACE FOR THE JUBILEE.</hi></head>
                            <p>While there may be more than one peace demonstration in different parts of the country in celebration of the conclusion of the war with Spain and the return of the volunteer soldiers to industrial pursuits, the peace jubilee projected in conjunction with the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha in October will be the great national jubilee commemorating the restoration of peace after war.</p>
                            <p>The reception to the returning war ships bearing their distinguished officers and crews must necessarily be tendered at some seaport town and the reviews of the different army corps no longer needed previous to disbandment at the points of their encampment.  But Omaha with its exposition offers the place for the popular glorification of the victory&#8212;for the national peace demonstration participated in by all the people as a tribute to the heroes high and low who have enlisted in the cause of humanity and successfully vindicated the country's honors.</p>
                            <p>With the people of the whole country already looking toward the exposition and the general movement of travel heading in this direction, Omaha becomes the natural center for the greatest peace celebration in the annals of the nation.  Perfectly organized and fully equipped for the accommodation of thousands of guests, central in geographical position, with unequaled railroad facilities reaching out to every point in the compass, the exposition city stands unrivaled for the promotion of the projected jubilee.</p>
                            <p>At no other place could the jubilee be made to teach so powerful and wide <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">John R. Key, the Great American Landscape Artist, at Work.</head>

                            <head type="sub">Short Sketch of the Man Who Preserved the World's Fair Magnificence and is Now Immortalizing the Transmississippi.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>John R. Key, the great American landscape painter, and a grandson of Francis Key, the author of "Star Spangled Banner," who has been in Omaha for some time past reproducing the beauties of the exposition on canvass, will leave in a day or two for the east, where he will make exhibits of his paintings as special commissioner of the exposition.  Mr. Key's high reputation in his profession and the magnificent views of the Omaha show that he has painted will give the easterners a more adequate idea of what the exposition really is than any amount of word painting could possibly convey.</p>
                            <p>This is not the first visit that Mr. Key has paid to Omaha and the change that has occurred since his first trip in 1859 impresses him most forcibly with the progress of the intervening years as represented by the Transmississippi Exposition.  When he first passed through Omaha he was on his way to assist in making the survey for the Humboldt route, and his party spent six months in making the journey across the plains that is now compassed in three days.  Some of his first art work was embodied in his illustrations of the Humboldt region, and a few years later when he was stationed at Fort Sumter he painted a series of views illustrating the interior of the fort during the bombardment.  The first set of these views was purchased by Admiral Dalgren and furnishes a realistic reproduction of the scenes that attended this fight.</p>
                            <p>Among his later works his painting of "The Golden Gate," which was awarded a first medal at the Centennial, was one of the most generally noticed, but since then his fame has become world-wide on account of his magnificent paintings which illustrate the principal features of the World's Fair.  These consist of four large canvasses each twenty feet long and ten feet high which are now on exhibition in the annex to the Illinois building on the exposition grounds.  The motives that inspired Mr. Key to attempt this task are best expressed in his own words.  He says: "The object of this work is to give an idea of the great exhibition of 1893.  As the construction of the buildings and grounds grew in magnitude and beauty I determined, as far as possible in my range of art, to paint a series of views to perpetuate this most wonderful production of our century, whose fame became worldwide.  It is gone forever, and as we now recall its exquisite proportions, its magnitude and its perfect symmetry, it seems as if a fairyland had risen from the lake in <choice><sic>crystalized</sic><corr>crystallized</corr></choice> splendor.  The oldest nations of the earth sent their noblest work and greatest men to pay homage to the newest city of the world, so great was its renown."</p>

                            <p>How well the artist succeeded in his patriotic aspirations is evident when his work is seen.  It has called forth <choice><sic>leters</sic><corr>letters</corr></choice> of the most enthusiastic approval from the World's Fair officials and the unrestrained admiration of hundreds of thousands of people who see on his canvas what seems like a living reproduction of the scenes of the Columbian exposition.  To study these paintings is to see the great fair just as it appeared underneath the shimmer of the summer sky and so realistic are the views that the observer might easily imagine himself confronted with the real instead of the idealized memory.</p>
                            <p>The first of these paintings represents the view from the Woman's building looking toward the south.  It is an afternoon effect in which the warm coloring of the foliage across the lagoon is emphasized by the darker colors which seem to come and go in the wake of the pleasure craft that dot the water.  Back of this rises the magnificent architecture of the Liberal Arts, Electricity and various other buildings and most artistic of all is the scarcely perceptible shadow of summer haze that hangs over the domes of the far away buildings and invests the canvas with all the charm of a real landscape.</p>
                            <p>The view of the Court of Honor from the Peristyle shows the full outline of the Grand Basin with the imposing architecture of the Administration building in the distance.

                            so many Indians or so many different tribes get together to eat dog, and that for this reason, the occasion should be regarded as a most memorable one.  As the Indian finished his speech he was greeted with cheers and cries of "serve the dog" came from all parts of the camp that happened to be in the vicinity of the fire.</p>
                            <p>"Serve it yourselves," promptly responded Mrs. Knows-No-Fear, who had superintended the cooking.</p>
                            <p>A second invitation was not needed, and in less time than it takes to tell it, all of the Indians who had an undisputed right to eat dog were gathered about the kettle and were fishing out pieces of dog.  There was enough to go around, but none to spare.</p>
                            <p>While the dog feast is not such a pleasant thing to witness, it is instructive and interesting to the whites, who stayed to the finish.  With the Indians it is a big thing and an event that will stand along with that of the white man's barbecue.</p>
                            <p>After the dog has been disposed of, the male Indians formed around the kettle and the few dying embers over which the cooking had been done and indulged in a dance.  This dance, however, was participated in only by those who had had dog for supper.  After that, however, there was a dance in which everybody took part, it making no difference whether or not the dancers had eaten dog flesh.</p>

                            <p>There is a design in the Horticultural building that is attracting considerable attention these days.  It is in the center of one of the tables of the Nebraska fruit exhibit and is the handiwork of J. H. Hackinson, one of the assistants to Superintendent Youngers.  This design is a bank of flowers, six feet long and two wide.  The body is blue and in white has been worked the words and letters, "Welcome, S. A. F. Tribute of Nebraska Horticultural Society."  In the four corners are small American flags, wrought in red, white and blue flowers.  The border is of bright colored flowers, backed up by fruit.</p>
                            <p>Iowa got in a fine assortment of new fruit yesterday, consisting of apples, peaches and pears.  Some fine vegetables were also sent along, notably some cabbage, the largest of which weighs twenty-one pounds.</p>
                            <p>In the Los Angeles exhibit from southern California some canaigre is being shown.  This is a tuber that takes the place of hemlock bark in tanning leather and is said to be equally as good for the purpose.  It grows like a carrot or parsnip and is about the color of a dark sweet <choice><sic>potatoe</sic><corr>potato</corr></choice>.  The raising of the root has become quite an important industry in southern California.  In preparing it for the market to treatment other than drying is required.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Detectives Trying to Unravel an Agricultural Building Secret.</head>
                            <p>There is a mystery lurking around the Agriculture building on the exposition grounds and while the entire police force has tried to ferret it out, it continues to lurk just the same.</p>
                            <p>Friday night the men who do the janitor work in the Agriculture building performed their labors the same as usual and left the structure shortly after midnight.  When they left everything was in perfect order.  During the remainder of the night the guards occupied their positions just inside the inner doors and swear that nobody entered the building during the night, but somebody did and conclusive evidence of their having been there was most apparent the following morning.  When the day force of men and women came into the building yesterday morning one of the women went into the toilet room and a moment later she reappeared whooping like a Comanche Indian and declaring that a woman had been killed in the room.  A hurried investigation was made and in the center of the room was found a full suit of female clothing, including everything usually worn between the hat and the stockings.  How they came here was the mystery and the mystery that remains unsolved.  That they had been cast off on account of their worthlessness was the first argument advanced, but this was easily disproven.  The clothing is of fine material and perfectly clean.  The dress is of rich material, such as would be worn only by a woman in good circumstances.</p>
                            <p>During the day the detective force made a thorough examination of the premises, but were unable to learn anything that would throw light upon the matter.  The night guards were questioned and both of them maintain that no person entered the building during the hours they were on duty.  The janitors declare they visited the toilet room just before they went off duty Saturday morning and that at that time there was no wearing apparel in the room or anywhere in the vicinity.</p>
                            <p>While the police do not feel certain, they have a theory.  They say it is possible that some woman, who for reasons best known to herself, desired to hide her identity, went into the toilet room, evaded the guards, <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Before the end of the week there will be a large increase in the population at the Indian congress.  The Crows who were due several days ago are expected during the early days of the week and later on large delegations from the Pottawattamies and Kickapoos will be here.</p>
                            <p>The ground in the central portion of the camp has been graded and smoothed and in the future all of the dances will be held there.  The location is directly in front of the tents occupied by the officers of the congress.</p>
                            <p>Over in the big lot where the Indian dances were formerly held, Captain Mercer's buffalo holds full and undisputed sway.  The animal is a ferocious bull, some 12 years old, and as wild as he is ugly.  When he was brought here he was put into a pen made of some patent wire fence.  The other day he broke through this and got into the dancing lot, from which he refuses to be ejected.  Several times the Indians have tried to drive him into a corral in the lower corner of the grounds, but he refuses to go, and when hard pressed, turns on the Indians and drives them from the lot.  Later in the season if the animal gets fat, he will be killed, at which time Captain Mercer will give a grand barbecue.</p>

The crowd was of surprising proportions considering the unusual heat of the day and it gave liberal attention to the band concert, the fireworks and every other feature of the evening.  The pyrotechnical display was especially brilliant last night and included a number of new designs that caught the crowd.  One was a mermaid in fire of changing colors that floated across the surface of the lake and another particularly pretty piece was a carpet design in which half a dozen colors rivaled each other in brilliancy.  One of the features of the entertainment was the discharge of the biggest shell that has yet been exploded on the grounds.  It was a forty-five pounder and it fairly filled the heavens with brilliant colored stars.</p>

                            <p>A remarkable agricultural exhibit has come in from North Dakota.  It is known as chufe and is apparently nothing but grass.  The top is grass and is very nutritious, but the verture lies in the roots of the plant.  There are hundreds of the little roots branching out from a parent stalk upon the end of which there is a little nut, much like the peanut, only smaller.  These nuts are used for fattening hogs and it is said that one bushel contains as much fat producing properties as ten bushels of corn.  One acre of the chufe will produce 200 bushels of the nuts.</p>

                            <p>OMAHA, Aug. 19.&#8212;To the Editor:  A special day, October 12, has been set aside as "Idaho day" at the Transmississippi and International Exposition, Omaha.  We have much pleasure in inviting you and your immediate family to the exposition on that date, and will be pleased to furnish you transportation over the Union Pacific railroad, in order that you may see this matchless enterprise of surpassing importance to the whole nation, and of special interest to Idaho and neighboring states, as it commemorates the marvelous development of the mighty west.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Western Passenger Association May Go by the Board, but the Rates Will Be Lowered&#8212;Some Concessions Already Announced.</head>
                            <p>There will be a meeting of the Western Passenger association in Chicago on Thursday of this week to take definite action in regard to reduced railroad rates for the remainder of the exposition.  This is the meeting that B. D. Caldwell, chairman of the Western Passenger association, was to have called the earlier part of last week.  Whether the association decides on a low line of rates for the exposition or not, the meeting is bound to be followed by the announcement of lower rates.  If the other lines do not care to agree to the rates proposed the Omaha terminal lines are prepared to put them on by individual action.</p>
                            <p>The excursions that have been offered recently, especially the initial children's excursions, especially the initial children's excursions, have been well patronized.  The cut rate of $1.75 between here and St. Joseph, offered in both directions by two competing lines, has also been numerously used by exposition travelers and has more than trebled the attendance from northwest Missouri during the last week.  The cut rate of $9.25 in effect both ways between Omaha and Chicago, on all four Omaha-Chicago lines, has also helped out travel.  Neither one of these cut rates, however, has been made on account of the exposition.  They are the result of a demoralized condition of western passenger rates.  As long as Omaha gets the cheap rates it does not care what cause brings them about and if further demoralization will bring lower rates the collapse of the entire Western Passenger association, whose business it is to maintain rates among the lines, will be very cordially welcomed here.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the cut rates mentioned, the following rates have been agreed upon by the association lines for special days at the exposition in the near future:</p>

                            <head type="sub">Union Pacific Arranges for Another Connection that Saves Much Time.</head>
                            <p>Within the last week the passenger service of the Union Pacific has been notably improved.  The service between this city and Denver has been doubled and the "Overland Route" now has two fast trains every day between the Exposition City and the Colorado capital instead of only one.</p>
                            <p>The improvement has been brought about by putting on an additional train on the Union Pacific, Denver &amp; Gulf road from Julesburg to Denver.  This train connects with the "Fast Mail" train, which leaves here at 4:35 o'clock every afternoon, arriving in Denver the next morning at 7:35 o'clock.  Formerly the "Fast Mail" had no connecting train at Julesburg and the only connection for Denver was made at Cheyenne, Wyo.  The change results in the saving of about four hours in the trip between here and Denver.  The returning train leaves Denver at 10 o'clock at night and reaches Omaha the following afternoon at 4:45 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>"The Colorado Special" train will continue to leave here at 11:55 p. m., five minutes before midnight, making an ideal train for exposition visitors who desire to remain and enjoy the beautiful illumination and other evening attractions of the big show.  This train now reaches Denver at 2:55 o'clock the next afternoon.  The corresponding train, eastbound, leaves Denver at 1:40 p. m. and reaches Omaha the next morning at 6:40 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>"The Overland Limited" is unchanged and leaves for the west at 8:50 o'clock every morning.  The increased train service of the Union Pacific now gives that route two Omaha-Denver trains, two Omaha-San Francisco trains and one Omaha-Portland train every day in the week.</p>
                            <p>New equipment has just been turned out of the shops for "The Chicago Special."  It made its first appearance in Omaha on Friday night, coming through from Chicago on the Chicago &amp; Northwestern.  It includes two handsome sleepers, a beautiful new buffet library car, two Scarret seat coaches and a new baggage car.  The equipment in use on the "Overland Limited" and the "Fast Mail" trains is thoroughly up to date, including standard and tourist sleeping cars, chair cars, coaches, and on the first named train a fine buffet library car.</p>

                            <p>The Union Pacific and the Burlington railroads have just agreed on a rate of $25 for the round trip from Ogden and Salt Lake City to Omaha for September 14, which will be celebrated as Utah day at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The distance from Salt Lake City to Omaha is 1,070 miles.  The tickets will be sold on the evening of Saturday, September 10, and all day on Sunday, September 11.  The tickets will have a limit of fifteen days, giving the folks from Utah a reasonable time to spend at the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">One of the Lines from that State is Responsible for Its Failure.</head>
                            <p>The railroads have declared the Missouri day rates off.  The day was to have been celebrated at the exposition on August 30.  The rates made were 1 cent per mile from points in Missouri within 150 miles of Omaha and also from Kansas City.  Outside of such points the best rate offered for the occasion was one fare for the round trip.  This rate was too high, and the Missouri people held out for a rate of 1 cent per mile from all points in the state.</p>
                            <p>Most of the passenger men in Omaha agree that a rate of 1 cent per mile from all points in the state would have been only fair.  General Passenger Agent Francis of the B. &amp; M. says:  "The Missouri people were entitled to a rate of 1 cent per mile from all points in the state.  They should have had it, I think, and I am sorry that all the lines would not agree to put it in."  One of the Missouri lines negatived the proposition, and the 1 cent rate for 150 miles and Kansas City was the best that could be secured.  The consequences was that the celebration planned fell through with, and now the railroads have made sure of the failure by withdrawing the rates they had offered.</p>

                            <p>The letters from the country editors accepting the World-Herald's invitation for World-Herald day are not only conveying to the exposition management pleasant information touching the indications for great success on that day, but are also advising them in the language of each individual editor of the extent of the "friendship" they bear for Mr. Rosewater, and of his "influence" with the country press of his own state.</p>
                            <p>It was the subject of a great deal of comment on the grounds yesterday, and it was generally remarked by directors and members of the executive committee, that under such a state of affairs and the evident injustice and unfair discrimination on the part of the manager of the department of publicity and promotion, it was surprising that the exposition had received any consideration whatever at the hands of the publishers of the weekly papers.</p>
                            <p>The letters have already had the effect of opening the eyes of some of the directors, who have heretofore believed that the statements regarding the situation were somewhat overdrawn, and who had accepted as true the allegations made by Mr. Rosewater as to his relations with the country press and the manner in which the press had been treated.</p>

                            <p>A prominent member of the directory remarked yesterday:</p>
                            <p>"These letters and the publication of Mr. Rosewater's 'illustrated exposition article' in Leslie's Weekly coming in just at this time will make a very unfavorable coincidence, so far as the manager of the advertising department is concerned.  They not only tend to absolutely disprove some of his assertions, but they also tend to prove to be a fact what a number of the directors have strongly suspected for some time&#8212;that if an editor taffies Mr. Rosewater he can get all the passes he wants, even though he roasts the exposition or gives it no space at all, while on the other hand, he may give the exposition column after column of valuable advertising, yet if he adversely criticises Mr. Rosewater he can get no consideration whatever at the hands of the head of our publicity and promotion department.  I am satisfied that this policy that has been and is still being pursued by Mr. Rosewater is costing the exposition dear, but it isn't a marker to the plan that he seems to have on foot in the east.</p>
                            <p>"If he has an uncomfortable mania to advertise himself in the eastern states I am of the opinion that the exposition can afford to give him $25,000 outright for the purpose of buying space for his personal boomlets in the eastern newspapers and periodicals, and have the exposition advertising run on its merits entirely apart from it, rather than to allow ourselves to be made a laughing stock of on the Leslie Weekly plan.  If it is a fact that the only way the exposition can secure mention in the east is due to its incidental connection with Mr. Rosewater, then Mr. Rosewater is altogether too valuable a jewel to be running around loose.  We ought to put him in a plush case and put a guard over hi, for he might get lost."</p>

The indications now are that the month of August will see another $80,000 chunk knocked off the indebtedness of the concern, and that the end of September will see the exposition entirely out of debt.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday's paid admissions numbered 7,896, which was regarded by the management as little less than remarkable, considering the intensity of the heat.  It was the only day thus far when the heat on the grounds has seemed to be a deadener, for visitors declined to move around much, but sought shady places in the <choice><sic>colonades</sic><corr>colonnades</corr></choice> and <unclear reason="torn"/>

The hospital corps had eighteen cases of heat exhaustion to look after during the day, but none of them were serious.</p>
                            <p>The waiters at the Casino struck at noon yesterday, owing to a misunderstanding with the management regarding percentage pay for meals served to Casino people.  The management declined to pay the regular percentage for this class on the score that they were deadheads, but the waiters took the position that the stage people received their board as a part of their compensation and that a percentage should be paid.  One of the waiters, C. Smith, after the strike was declared, went to Markel's pavilion and tried to induce the waiters there to walk out.  When he was unsuccessful he raised a disturbance and was arrested.</p>

                            <p>J. S. Brown, F. C. McMahon and Burt Brown got into a fight with the bartender at the Casino later in the afternoon as a result of the strike, and were locked up.  Several blows were struck, and one of the new men who had been put to work had a finger badly bitten in the fray.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee last evening formally completed arrangements for Colonel Key to start east on an advertising trip in the interest of the exposition.  The contract was also awarded to Thomas Hurd for the erection of a fire house and tower on the north tract for use during the firemen's tournament.  The cost of the building is $565.  An amphitheater and several other buildings will have to be constructed.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Foster yesterday began the work of putting up additional fencing for the tournament.  The Missouri Pacific track is to be completely fenced out of the north tract, so as to leave an enclosure entirely fenced off by itself.</p>
                            <p>The Missouri Pacific has decided to join with the other roads in the matter of children's excursions, and its day will be next Saturday, at which time the round trip rate from Auburn will be $1.00 and from Weeping Water 50 cents.  Other rates will be announced later.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Preparations for Meeting of Choirs in September.</head>
                            <p>In connection with the exposition there will be held on the grounds a choral congress which it is thought will be an event of more than ordinary importance.  The transportation department has arranged for a very reduced railroad rate, and the executive committee has arranged to admit the visiting choirs free of charge to the exposition.  All choirs in the vicinity of the exposition will be able to take a trip to the great show in bodies, and they will have the bureau of public comfort to look after them, and secure for them the best advantages in regard to boarding and lodging at the lowest possible rates.  They will have a pass which will be good to enter the grounds at all times.  They will also have the advantages of meeting with other choral societies and singing in a grand chorus of 600 voices, with one of the very best bands in the world.</p>
                            <p>The congress will open September 23 and close September 26.  The Auditorium will be reserved for the use of the visitors these four days, and the band stand on the grand plaza <choice><sic>wil lbe</sic><corr>will be</corr></choice> at their disposal.</p>

                            <p>On Tuesday and Thursday evenings of this week there will be given at the exposition in connection with the bureau of music a magnificent and imposing spectacle entitled "The Spanish-American War."  Music will be furnished by the Mexican National band, the McCook band, the exposition chorus and a selected male quartet.  Stereopticon views, magnificent in color and true to life, will be shown by Will J. Stevens, whose success in this particular line has already created much favorable comment.  The story will be as follows:</p>
                            <p>Leaving New York harbor and passing the Statue of Liberty one sees the Maine ready to leave New York harbor, with Captain Sigsbee sitting in his cabin, and some of the vessels of the American fleet on their way to Cuba.  Entering Havana harbor, the next stopping place is at the palace gardens and continuing through the park until the arrival at the palace, where festivities are in progress and the strain of La Paloma are heard proceeding from the castle.  Going through a street in Havana and passing the American hotel, we finally arrive at a place where we can see the Maine in Havana harbor, and General Lee visiting the vessel.  Coming closer, the sailors of the Maine are heard singing the celebrated old song, "The Soldiers' Farewell."  After seeing the group of men we retrace our steps and hear the chimes of the churches toll out the hour of nine.  The sound of an explosion is heard and the lurid glare of a bomb draws our attention to the fact that something is wrong.  Hastening toward the harbor once more we see the men going to the rescue.</p>
                            <p>The next scene in the picture is the sad funeral ceremonies.  Then comes the closing chapter in which Uncle Sam is depicted sending his sailors and soldiers to avenge the destruction of his heroes.  The leading vessels of the fleet are seen passing before the view, including the New York, Brooklyn, Indiana, Charleston, Atlanta, Massachusetts and Oregon..  Admirals Sampson and Dewey, General Shafter and Miles, and Lieutenant Hobson.</p>
                            <p>Hastily the story proceeds with an illustration of the famous American generals who have passed away, concluding with President McKinley and the American flag, the latter feature being saluted by the a magnificent pyrotechnic display of bombs, rockets, shells and volleys, while the band plays the "Star Spangled Banner."</p>
                            <p>This feature was the suggestion of Musical Director Kelly, and he is planning carefully to make it a big success.</p>

The program for Pennsylvania day will include addresses by Postmaster General Smith and Governor Hastings and brief talks by local Pennsylvanians.  It will be interesting to the folk back home to know that there are 10,000 Pennsylvania voters in the state of Nebraska and 1,000 more in the city of Omaha, which means that there are over 50,000 native Pennsylvanians now residing in this state.</p>

                            <p>The program for Sioux City day at the Omaha exposition has just been completed by H. F. McGarvie, director of special days.</p>
                            <p>The events of the day, August 25, given up to the Corn Palace city, are as follows:</p>
                            <p>The mayor and city officials of Sioux City will be met at the depot by the mayor and common council of Omaha and conveyed to the exposition grounds, where a formal reception will be held at 11 a. m. in the Auditorium.</p>
                            <p>Speech of welcome by Mayor Moores of Omaha, responses by Mayor Quick of Sioux City and an address by President Wattles of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>A committee appointed by Mayor Quick some time ago has been urging people to help swell the Sioux City contingent.  The committee has been diligently at work and now over 1,000 are expected to come on the special train which will convey the Sioux City people here.</p>
                            <p>The Sioux City delegation will be decked with badges, and the train probably may be handsomely decorated.  There is some expectation that when Omaha is reached the Sioux City folks may march carrying corn stalks.</p>

                            <p>The much heralded "Trilby," by Astley Cooper, was placed upon exhibition last Thursday evening in the elegant structure called "Trilby Temple," on the East Midway.  The doors were opened at 7 o'clock, and more than 1,000 visitors passed in the exhibition room the first three hours.  The picture comes here so highly indorsed by eastern critics and the press that naturally every one anticipated a great treat in the line of art, but not such a one as met the gaze of the many visitors.  To say that "Trilby" is wonderful and grand but mildly expresses it.  It is a beautiful vision.  Cooper has represented Du Maurier's heroine as posing for the life class, standing on a pedestal in an alcove.  When the visitors first enter the room they are loth to believe that they are not looking at a beautiful living model.  The effect produced on this canvas has never before been equaled.  The relief is so wonderful that the figure actually appears to be three feet away from the background, and it looks as though one could walk around it.  The drawing, the modeling, and flesh tints are truly wonderful.  The pose is the acme of grace and the entire effect is most charming.  There is nothing indelicate about "Trilby," it is one of those beautiful creations that appeal to the better senses of the beholder.  A description cannot do it justice.  This great picture will without doubt be one of the</p>

                            <head type="sub">Never Had Any From Chicago---Only Rate War Brings Them.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Contrast Between Rates Asked and "Practically Same Rates" Advised by Roads.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Business Men Indignant at Deception Chairman Caldwell and Local Officials Have Practiced Upon Them.</head>
                            <p>While there is a certain amount of expectancy in railroad circles, there is also a decided lack of predictions regarding the putting in of lower rates on account of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>As a matter of fact there have not been since the exposition opened, and there are not in force now, any reduced rates on account of the exposition from either Chicago or the east.  Up to a couple of weeks ago persons coming from or through Chicago to visit the exposition took advantage of the regular summer tourist round trip ticket rates of 80 per cent of the regular fare, which made the rate $20.50 from Chicago.  Since then the roads, without reference to the exposition, but on account of rate reductions on the Chicago-St. Paul and other lines, have put in a rate of $9.25 to and from Chicago, or $18.50 for the round trip.  No reduction from this rate is made on account of the exposition, and the only reduction so far urged by the local Omaha terminal roads is that on one day in the week round trip tickets be sold for one regular fare, plus $2, or $14.75.</p>
                            <p>The request of the exposition directory and Commercial club committees was for a one-fare round trip rate, tickets to be sold every day in the week, and as this rate was not by any week, and as this rate was not by any means as favorable as the rate granted the Nashville exposition from Chicago and other large cities it was confidently expected it would be put in.</p>
                            <p>This feeling was confirmed when Chairman Caldwell of the Western Passenger association stated for publication immediately after the meeting here August 6 that the Omaha terminal lines were a unit on the matter, that they would recommend practically the same rates asked for by the exposition and Commercial club committees, and that they would very probably be granted.  Later Mr. Caldwell's statement regarding the recommendation of rates by the Omaha terminal lines was confirmed by the local officials of those lines, and it is the fact that such statements were not true, and were given out to deceive and temporarily quiet them, that has aroused the indignation of all those who have been endeavoring to secure fair rates.  While one fare rates, plus $2, tickets to be sold on only one day in the week, may be practically the same in the opinion of railroad men to one fare round trip rates, tickets to be sold on every day in the week&#8212;which was the rate asked for&#8212;there is a vast difference between them in the opinion of the men working to make the exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>The short distance rates recommended by the Omaha terminal lines, and which to some extent have been put in force by them, are practically the same as those asked for by the exposition directory and Commercial club committees, and are satisfactory.  But the rates for points over 150 miles from Omaha are not.</p>
                            <p>In this connection the statement has been repeatedly made in business circles during the past two weeks that both the Omaha terminal lines and the Western Passenger association have been working right along to make the exposition a purely local affair.  The less than one fare round trip rates to the Nashville exposition were put in from Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati and all over the south and east when the Nashville exposition opened and kept in until it closed.</p>
                            <p>The third month of the Trans-Mississippi exposition will be over in a few days, and no general rates have up to the present time been announced for it, and local railway officials have been saying during the last few days that in their judgment the only way in which reduced rates will be secured for the exposition, if they are secured at all, is not through the voluntary action of the Western Passenger association, or a combination of the Omaha terminal lines to give them, but on account of a rate war between the Chicago-St. Paul, the Chicago-Omaha and the Chicago<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">Argument Piling Up in Favor of the Half-Rate Admission for the Sabbath.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Excessive Heat Helps to Reduce Attendance and Gate Receipts Are Wretchedly Small.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Ice Water for the Public Found Once More in Tanks---Concessionaire on the Under Side--Slot Doesn't Work.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday was another 50-cent Sunday, and it was one of the lightest days in point of both attendance and gate receipts that the exposition has seen since the opening.  There were but 3,158 paid and 3,989 free admissions, and not only did the grounds have a deserted appearance, but the gate receipts looked sick beside the much-abused 25-cent Sunday.  The heat was, of course, in a measure responsible for the marked falling off in attendance, though it was not responsible for keeping everybody at home, as the street car travel to the parks was unusually heavy.</p>
                            <p>The day on the grounds was by no means as bad as Saturday, and the few who were there seemed more inclined to move about than did the crowd on the preceding day.  There were several cases of heat prostration.  Aside from these cases, the hospital corps found little to occupy its attention, although the bicycle chain in the Manufactures building claimed its third finger nail as a victim.</p>
                            <p>If the day had any distinguishing characteristics it was due to the penny-in-the-slot machines.  There has been considerable complaint about these machines from the start, on account of their erratic disposition.  Sometimes they will work and sometimes they won't, and disappointed patrons have been prone to claim that the time selected for balking was just when they were most needed.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ICE WATER ON TAP.</head>
                            <p>It will be remembered that the management some time ago heeded popular clamor and put in a lot of free ice water tanks about the grounds, but after a few days' service the ice supply was discontinued, and the tanks have since served only to keep the management in hot water.  It was stated that the free ice water supply was cut off on account of the expense, but in official circles it was understood that the ice water concessionaire's kicking had something to do with it.</p>
                            <p>At any rate, the kicking of the public is now having some effect, as free ice water is again on tap at the various tanks, and the concessionaire bids f<unclear reason="covered"/> to find time hanging heavy on his hands.  A further result of the complaints has been the issuance of an order to the guards directing them to levy on a slot machine whenever they find one that is not working and take it to the station.  This order applies to all kinds of slot machines, whether water, gum, candy or postal cards.  Inasmuch as one of the water tanks weighs about 200 pounds when its digestive apparatus is unimpaired, the sight of a guard leading one of them to the station will furnish extra entertainment for visitors.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GRIEF OVER SLOT MACHINE.</head>
                            <p>The slot machine water concessionaire has had considerable grief on his hands on account of the habit people have fallen into of hammering a machine when it refuses to deliver a quid pro quo, and also through the operations of evil-disposed persons who have tried to make the machine throw up its hands and deliver without dropping the required coin.  Numerous complaints have been made to the guards on this account, and it is also claimed that there have been attempts to open the machines and rob the cash drawer of its pennies.</p>
                            <p>A number of the guard force participated in an unfortunate mix-up near the west end of the lagoon yesterday afternoon.  One of the penny-in-the-slot ice water machines was the cause.  Bronson Andrews, one of the lagoon gondoliers, wanted a drink of water and tackled the machine.  He says he dropped in a penny and the machine did not work.  He thereupon thumped the machine to induce it to get down to business, and was observed by the proprietor, who called on a guard to arrest him for trying to beat the machine.  A number of Andrews' associates took his part and the guard<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Sergeant Norwood and a squad responded, and after a round in which several blows were struck the guards marched seven prisoners to the station.  All but Andrews were subsequently released, Andrews being <unclear reason="torn"/> to the city jail, charged with malicious destruction of property.  Two or three of the guards received more or<unclear reason="covered"/> damaged eyes and noses, and an<unclear reason="torn"/>cial catalogue seller who remonstrated with the guards was handed a t<unclear reason="covered"/> on the jaw.</p>

This is to allow sufficient time for the completion of the pr<unclear reason="covered"/> before the life saving exhibition <unclear reason="covered"/> given on the lagoon at 4 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Kelly of the <unclear reason="covered"/> of music today introduces a new<unclear reason="covered"/> feature in the shape of an organ recital at the Auditorium.  It will take place at 1:30 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>The attempt to hold religious services on the grounds yesterday was even less of a success than any of the former ones, and it is stated by members of the committee having the matter in charge that no further efforts will be made in this direction, as they have become convinced that people will not indulge in sermons at 50 cents apiece to any extent.  Barely a handful of people straggled into the Auditorium yesterday afternoon after paying their way into the grounds, and aside from the discouragingly small audience the atmosphere on the platform was so uncomfortable that Rev. Dr. Green announced that he would not attempt to preach.  Prayer was offered and All Saints' choir gave a short song service.</p>
                            <p>Manager Lindsey of the department of ways and means stated last evening that he had been opposed to a 50-cent rate all along, but he was swinging around to the belief that it would be better to put the reduced rate in effect on Sunday, unless the grounds can be closed entirely on that day.  He was opposed to Sunday opening at the start, and is still in favor of closing, but as the next best thing he is inclined to favor a 25-cent rate in conjunction with the reduced rate on Thursday evening.</p>

                            <p>The display of fireworks Saturday night was more brilliant and extensive than usual and the great audience appreciated the efforts of John Due, who never fails to give an entertainment that calls forth hearty applause.</p>
                            <p>Among the new set pieces the mermaid and the maltese cross were the most admired, while the bucking goats, the elephant and many other set pieces were greatly enjoyed.  The aerial effects were decidedly beautiful and for the first time Mr. Due sent up one of his famous forty-five-inch shells.  The Due double shell was also exploded and, as usual, was well received.  The display concluded with the good-night piece and a grand bombardment on the lake.</p>

                            <p>Armand and Carmen, the international dancers and singers in the theater of the Streets of All Nations, will entertain the public, beginning next week, with an electric act, recently introduced in vaudeville shows in Paris.  This act will undoubtedly meet with the approval of the many patrons of the show.  Mr. Abdalla Hamadi, the acrobatic clown, will give an imitation of the banker in the Klondike today.  This act alone is well worth the price of admission into the Streets.  The Streets of India will arrive here from Coney Island about the last of this month, and the first of September it will be put on in conjunction with the splendid show which has made the Streets of All Nations so famous.  Mr. Neimy, manager of the Streets of All Nations, will take a trip east in a few days to secure other new features for the show.</p>

                            <p>The presence of a large excursion party from the Black Hills country injected a new element into the exposition crowd this morning.  A flat 1-cent-a-mile rate, with tickets good for ten days, was an excellent inducement, and the excursionists constituted a very valuable addition to the usual attendance.  As most of them expect to remain in town long enough to inspect the show at their leisure, they were in no hurry to get out to the grounds this morning, but during the forenoon a considerable number reported at the Black Hills exhibit in the Mines building and expressed their hearty approval of the show.  The attendance of the Black Hills party was not signalized by any formal ceremonies, as they preferred to spend their time in the enjoyment of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The exposition has now reached a stage of prosperity that conclusively indicates its eventual success.  While some proportion of its floating debt remains it has been so largely discharged that there is every indication that it will be fully eliminated before the end of September.  Then will come the peace jubilee and the biggest month of the show to make the success of the enterprise certain.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">Some Satisfactory Statistics.</head>
                            <p>The exact financial condition of the association cannot be stated until the end of the month, when the bills are presented and the cost of operation is exactly known.  It is calculated that the cost of operation is not more than $2,000 a day and it is believed that it will be slightly less than that amount, as a number of bills have been paid that belong to the August expenditures.  At the beginning of August it was stated that the debt of the association amounted to $180,000 in round numbers.  At the close of business Saturday night it was $95,000, plus the cost of operation for twenty days, which is not more than $40,000.  This shows that the exposition is at least $45,000 ahead on the first twenty days of August and this would indicate an aggregate profit of nearly $70,000 during the month, over and above operating expenses.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday the receipts were scarcely up to this standard.  The excessive heat of the preceding day was more than ordinarily oppressive after the delightful weather of the preceding two weeks.  People awoke wearied and enervated and reluctant to move further than necessary from the coolest spot in their habitations.  The Omaha people who were on the grounds yesterday would scarcely fill the court of The Bee building, but the country visitors were still in evidence.  They had come from all over a radius of 500 miles to see the show and they were not to be deterred by a blast of tropical heat.  Once on the ground they were fully as comfortable as those who stayed at home.  Whatever breath of cooling zephyr was permitted to give an instant's relief from the throbbing heat became a delightful breeze as it swept over the wide area of landscape and fanned the sluggish lagoon.  The walks and promenades were continually drenched with cool water from the hydrants and this relieved the visitors from the refraction of the heat rays.  There were a score of places on the grounds where the people could sit and drone away the afternoon in comparative comfort and in the evening the breeze that crept up along the bluff brought a happy relief that was not shared by those who preferred to stay down town and swelter in the heat that the buildings and pavements had accumulated during the day.</p>

                            <p>The regular band concerts and the religious services in the Auditorium were the only features of the day and these suffered.  People were glad enough to loll in the shade and listen in a sluggish way to the music, but it was too hot to reward the musicians with any considerable manifestation of appreciation.  Even the Mexicans, familiar with tropical skies, felt the weight of their heavy uniforms and seemed well satisfied that encores were not more frequent.</p>
                            <p>After the activity of the preceding days the Midway seemed like a deserted village.  A few people picked their way along the shady side and scattered groups patronized the resorts where summer beverages were dispensed.  But the other attractions simply took an afternoon off.  The spielers lurked back in the shade and limited their vocal efforts to an occasional drowsy reminder that they were still alive.  But nothing rewarded their exertion and a number of the resorts gave it up and waited until night.</p>

                            <p>The dry dock in the naval exhibit in the Government building is now in place and the regular exhibitions will begin in a day or two.  The model of the battleship Illinois has been unpacked and installed in the dock.  It presents a more modern type of battleship than the other models that are exhibited, but in the opinion of the naval experts in the building it does not look as though it would be as effective a fighting machine as the Massachusetts or Oregon.  The additional height of free board offers a more tempting target to the enemy's guns and the arrangement of the upper works is not so well adapted to avoid damage under fire.</p>
                            <p>The dock was filled for the first time yesterday and the big ship was floated in from the basin.  It was a very fascinating sight when the battleship was afloat and as soon as the public exhibitions are begun they promise to make the naval exhibit even more popular than it is now.</p>

                            <p>If anyone thinks that the exposition attendance is limited merely to the people of the territory immediately adjacent to Omaha the idea can be corrected by a glance at almost any of the registers that are kept at various exhibits.  These show that people are already coming to the exposition from nearly every state in the union and the proportion of signatures that represent far away states is surprising.  Georgia has a small exhibit in the Agriculture building, where a register is kept for the convenience of visitors.  Although Saturday was far from being the big day of the week the register shows the signatures of people from twenty-eight different states, covering every section of the country.  It is not at all unusual to find signatures representing twenty or more states on a single day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Invitation for the Two States to Form a Closer Alliance.</head>
                            <p>Miss Forrest Tucker, special commissioner for Texas, while rejoicing in the success of Texas day, is to leave for Texas this week to enlist still further patronage of the exposition from the Lone Star state.  She has issued a letter in the shape of a message from Texas to Nebraska under the title, "Our Progress," in part as follows:</p>
                            <p>So closely are the interests of the Lone Star state united with the interests of the people representing the states that are now in the great Transmississippi Fair that I make the topic of what I may say, "Our Progress."  In fact if your state and Texas had been born twins, and Siamese twins at that, they would hardly be more needed to each other.  Texas is your other half and you are too eager for "Our Progress" to argue which one represents the stronger half.  In fact, should this point be settled, we would be vetoed by those brilliant searchers of truth who advocate the noble proposition, "The weaker vessel is the stronger."  We all have our own pivots on which to turn the off-shoots and springs of our own idealized fancy.  The only way to receive the full joy and comfort of our own, is to allow our neighbor to raise his colors in full view.  In drawing together and arranging in line for full view, Omaha is the truly realized magnet.  As a casket, rich and bejeweled, she is decked in holiday attire and throws open her gates to all transmississippi united.  Within her domains she invites the neighboring states to pitch their tents, raise their flags and sing their songs.  Texas has had her day, and from the laurel wreaths of the orators of our own native land we would cull a sparkling gem to radiate in <sic>prisomed</sic> glory over the solitaire state of the union.</p>
                            <p>We earnestly solicit your consideration of Texas, a volume of leaflets, and all you have to do is pick and draw.  Unlike a lottery, each sheet contains a prize and you are judge of the advantage of the most prized by you.  Texas wants you and Texas offers you a port in which to handle your goods.  Come this way and everything will co<unclear reason="torn"/> the world's most recognized port&#8212;Galveston&#8212;known from the Pacific to the Atlantic, from the Rockies to the Andes, from the northern districts of Canada to the southern clime of Old Mexico.  Shake hands with the city of jetties, of shipping, transportation, harbor and deep water facilities, fascinating enough to charm the most listless and enthuse the most lifeless.  But come and see us and you may "read your title clear."  The nearer you draw yourself to good stocks, the greater will be your dividends.  Texas holds the scales which measure out the largest profits.  Load your ships from any section of the known united western and transmississippi states; send them out by way of Galveston harbor, the old gulf whose every breeze fans a silvery wave of gain and a golden tide of profit.</p>
                            <p>As the soldier stands to his order, as the statesman to his principles, as the orator to his subject&#8212;so each of us would do service to his flag, true to our own, the land of our hope; the land of our pride, as devoted as the soldier to his sweetheart chosen, as is told in the little story sketched for you entitled "Uncle Sam's Regiment, the Gallant Boys of the North and South, Fighting for One Flag and One Cause."  In the war of peace and progress, Omaha is now making a gallant fight.  She invites all the states to join her ranks, gather in and welcome with her, and shake hands with the great western advance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Bronson Andrews Has Fun and Now Reposes in Jail.</head>
                            <p>Bronson Andrews will know better than to break any more of the automatic drinking fountains upon the exposition grounds.  For breaking one of these machines yesterday afternoon, he was arrested and is now in the city jail, where he is likely to be charged with malicious destruction of property and also with assaulting an officer.</p>
                            <p>Andrews and a number of his friends were strolling through the colonnades in the vicinity of the <choice><sic>Governoment</sic><corr>Government</corr></choice> building, when it suddenly occurred to him that he was thirsty.  He says that he slipped a penny into the slot and that the machine would not give down.  Right at this point the stories diverge, for Guard Kelly says that Andrews was thumping the machine and was told to desist.  Instead of doing so, he kept right on and then he was placed under arrest.  His friends jumped in and would not have it that way.  Then the guard weakened and hurried to the station for assistance.  When the forces arrived, there was a skirmish, during which Kelly was given a black eye, which is now tied up in a beef steak poultice.  Andrews, however, was finally overcome and was taken to the station and later transferred to the city jail.</p>
                            <p>The fracas was the cause of a declaration of war, not only against the water tanks, but against all the penny-in-the-slot machines on the grounds.  During the last few days numerous complaints have been filed with the exposition officials to the effect that the machines and especially those selling water are built upon the robbing order and that instead of giving value returned, they give nothing.  As soon as the trouble occurred between Andrews and the guards, an order was issued to confiscate and carry to the police station every slot machine that would not sell the articles it purported to carry.</p>
                            <p>This order was read when the 4 o'clock shift went on duty and in less than an hour water tanks, gum machines, candy boxes, postal cards and numerous other devices began to appear.  It was no uncommon sight to see a guard walk into the station with a huge water tank on his shoulder and a gum selling slot machine under an arm.  The procession kept right on moving and when the gates closed for the night, the drill room at the station had every resemblance of a well regulated junk shop, or one that makes a specialty of dealing in slot machines.  None of the machines will be put in service again until they are repaired and put in working order.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Preparations in Progress for a Big Gathering of the Fire Fighters.</head>
                            <p>This week the Department of Buildings and Grounds will begin active preparations for the accommodation of the National Firemen's tournament, which will be held September 5 or 10.  The people who have been working up interest in the tournament among the various fire fighting organizations of the country have been somewhat dissatisfied at what they regard as the dilatory policy of the exposition management in fixing up the grounds, but it is stated that there is ample time for all necessary preparation and that everything will be found satisfactory when the big event is pulled off.</p>
                            <p>President Fred A. Wood of the National Firemen's association is now in Omaha and his correspondence indicates that the tournament will be bigger than anyone anticipated.  This is the first national tournament that has been held since 1878 and the firemen all over the United States are taking a tremendous interest in the event.  This is partially due to the fact that participation in the tournament permits them to visit the exposition at a very slight expense and <unclear reason="torn"/>

                            periority as they would in a crack regiment of infantry.  Money is being raised in hundreds of cities scattered all over the United States to send their crack companies to the tournament and it is expected that each place will also contribute a considerable party of citizens who will take advantage of the low railroad rates that will be in force for the occasion.</p>
                            <p>President Wood says that the attendance from Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and a number of other states will be general and there will be representatives from each coast.  The Veteran Firemen's association of Portland, Ore., is coming 100 strong and there is an encouraging prospect that the famous veteran firemen's organization of New York City will also be present in large numbers.  Over fifty companies are already enrolled in the various events and President Wood estimates that the tournament will bring fully 50,000 people to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Prizes aggregating $10,000 have been put up for the various events that are scheduled on the six days during which the tournament will continue.  The celebration will begin Monday, September 5, with a big street parade at 10 o'clock, in which prizes aggregating over $600 will be awarded for various points of superiority.  In the afternoon there will be a program of hose and hook and ladder races, coupling contests, ladder climbing, and pompier work, and a test of extinguishing a fire on a burning building.  The prizes in each case are sufficiently valuable to call out a lively competition and similar programs will occupy the remainder of the week.</p>
                            <p>Some of the events will be wonderfully realistic and exciting.  Large buildings will be set on fire and the various companies will vie with each other in extinguishing the flames in the quickest possible time.  There will also be exciting rescues of people from the burning buildings and every incident of the fireman's work will be graphically depicted.</p>

                            <p>The exposition officials are becoming pretty thoroughly convinced that Sunday opening with a 50-cent rate attachment is not the thing to use in drawing crowds and if the sentiment in favor of a change continues to grow the gates of the exposition will either be closed on Sunday or opened with a 25-cent admission fee.</p>
                            <p>This sentiment was voiced by Manager Lindsey last night when he said:  "We have either got to close the gates on Sunday or else put the price of admission down to 25 cents.  The cash today show that the people don't want to come to the exposition on Sunday and pay the same price that they do on other days of the week.  I don't know but that they are right in staying away.  On Sundays we are opening the gates at 1 o'clock in the afternoon and are charging the same price that we do on week days when we open at 8 o'clock in the morning.  Then there is another thing to be considered.  The Government building is closed on Sunday and many of the exhibits in the other buildings are covered up.  None of the live exhibits are in operation, so you see people cannot be blamed for not wanting to come out on Sunday and pay full price for half a day's sightseeing and then only seeing one-half of the sights.  I am pretty thoroughly convinced that the crowd that comes on Sunday on the cheap rate is not the crowd that comes during the week, so I can't see where it would hurt the week day attendance if the Sunday admission fee was cut in two.</p>
                            <p>"The expense of running the exposition on Sunday is practically the same as on other days.  We have to have the guards, the ticket sellers and takers and we have to run the engines to supply the power and lights, so that we save no great amount of money.  We might as well run with the same expense and have a big crowd at 25 cents as to run and have only a few people on the grounds at 50 cents each."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Iowa Crowds, Bohemians and Nebraska Editors to See Fireworks.</head>
                            <p>The exposition schedule for the current week is full of attractive incidents and with the excellent rates that have been secured for various special occasions another increase in the attendance is anticipated.  Tuesday will be Des Moines day and a big crowd of excursionists from the Iowa capital is in prospect.  A very low rate has been secured and the people who have arranged the trip believe that the day will be a big success.  From Sioux City will come to the exposition a number of special trains Thursday and its citizens will likewise celebrate the occasion by appropriate exercises.</p>
                            <p>During the latter part of the week the Bohemians will be in Omaha in large numbers and on Saturday they will be the guests of the day at the grounds.  A special fireworks display will be given Saturday evening for their benefit and this will include a representation of the Bohemian <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>On Wednesday a large party of Nebraska editors will visit the exposition as the guests of a local paper and the evening will also be signalized by a special fireworks display.  As fireworks will also be incident to the descriptive fantasie that will be given by the Mexican band Tuesday and Thursday evenings there will be pyrotechnics on four nights during the week.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday the Indians took life about as easy as any of the people on the exposition grounds.  The weather was too hot for them and they found nothing more comfortable than lying about in the shade and fanning themselves with turkey wings, of which they always seem to have an abundance.  The only Indians at the exposition who seem to enjoy the hot weather of the last few days are the Apaches, who come from the deserts of Arizona.  They fairly revel in a temperature of 100 degrees and declare that it makes them feel at home.  Instead of hunting shady places they warp their many-colored blankets about them and sit out in the sun, their heads perfectly bare.  During the rainy days of a few weeks ago these Indians were disgusted with this climate and insisted that if they remained here long they would freeze to death, but now they have changed their tune and are as frolicsome as a lot of kittens.</p>

                            <p>The McCook Cornet band arrived last night and will spend a week at the exposition.  The concerts will in nowise interfere with those to be given by the Mexican band.  The McCook boys will give their first concert this afternoon at 2 o'clock, playing at the Transportation building on the north  tract.  The band contains forty-two members and is regarded as the crack band of the state.  Most of the boys were on the grounds last evening and attended the concert on the Plaza given by the Mexican band.</p>

                            <p>The people who visited the exposition yesterday were glad of one thing, and that was that they found that ice water was free and that they were not compelled to pay a penny for a cool drink.</p>
                            <p>A long time ago a concession was granted to a penny-in-the-slot concern.  This provided that tanks should be placed about the grounds and ice water sold from them.  Subsequently the exposition people put in barrels at different places about the grounds and put in water and ice.  Later on the slot machine concessionaire protested and the ice was taken from the barrels, compelling people to buy cool water or drink that very warm.  This condition prevailed until Saturday, when an order went out to again commence filling the barrels with ice.  Ice was put in yesterday.</p>

                            <p>There was to have been religious services in the Auditorium yesterday afternoon, but the conditions of the weather interfered.  It was too torrid in the great building and only a handful of people were present.  In the place of preaching there was a song service by the choir of All Saints' Episcopal church, after which the meeting was dismissed.  Rev. Thomas Green of Cedar Rapids, Ia., had accepted an invitation to preach, but he found the temperature too horrid.  He explained the situation and said that in his judgment it was too warm for people to sit and listen to sermons, no matter how eloquent the preacher might be.</p>

                            <p>The special train carrying the Des Moines excursionists will leave that city at 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.  As it will require at least four hours to make the 145 miles, it is not likely that the exercises at the Auditorium will begin much before noon.  These will be similar to those which marked previous municipal days and will consist of addresses of welcome by Mayor Moores and President Wattles, with responses by the visitors and music by the band.</p>

                            <p>The acceptance by President McKinley of the invitation of the exposition management, extended to him by Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, to visit the Omaha exposition in October and take part in the projected peace jubilee, means more for the exposition than any other pieces of good fortune that has befallen it.</p>
                            <p>President McKinley has on more than one occasion shown his friendship for the people of the transmississippi region by favors to the exposition, which has been built to typify the marvellous resources and wonderful progress of the great west.  By his signature legislation has been enacted to give the exposition the advantage of government participation, and his administration in all its branches has co-operated enthusiastically to make the exposition the grand success that it is proving.</p>
                            <p>The highest manifestation of the president's good will to the mighty enterprise, however, is to be found in his promise to attend the exposition in person and lend the influence of his presence to inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the peace jubilee.  With the great war president, by whose wise direction peace has been so happily restored, as the central figure, the peace demonstration at the Omaha exposition will take the form of a national celebration and enlist popular participation that will make it go down into history alongside of the other grand events in humanity's closing war drama.</p>

                            <head type="sub">The Old Story, Unable to Get Rates From Roads---$11.50 the Best Offer.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Yet $5 Rate Used to Be Given to St. Louis and Return for St. Louis' Fair---Many Now Kept Away.</head>
                            <p>"St. Louis Day at the exposition has <choice><sic>folowed</sic><corr>followed</corr></choice> on the heels of Missouri Day, and been declared off," said George W. Lucking, at the Murray yesterday.  "A committee was appointed, and went to work to arrange for the visit of Future Greaters to Omaha, and the first thing done was to go for a special rate, and get beautifully turned down.  My understanding is they could not get an open rate of 1 cent a mile, and the best the committee could do, as reported, was $11.50 for the round trip.  That is the best rate we can get, and tickets are on sale at that rate three days each week, good for ten days; the other four days the round trip rate is $17.  There will be no St. Louis day, and the idea is abandoned, so far as I can learn; and learning this a small party of us come up yesterday to spend a week at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"I am sure, had the committee secured rates a very large delegation would have come from St. Louis and points between St. Louis and Kansas City.  St. Louis feels very kindly toward the exposition, and the disappointment is keenly felt.  All who have been here have returned delighted, and set others on ends to come."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Luking is a member of the city official family, and is in the city collector's office.  He is accompanied by Mrs. Luking, Miss Mamie Leonard and others.  They will spend the week in the city.</p>
                            <p>Just what rate the St. Louis committee asked of the railroads for St. Louis day is not definitely known, but considering the crowd that would have taken advantage of the occasion to come to Omaha an $8 rate would have been large, and have left a good margin for the railroads, and would no <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>It is a fact that some years ago a rate of $5 for the round trip from Omaha to St. Louis to all who wished to attend the St. Louis exposition was given.  The St. Louis exposition begins soon again, and no doubt a similar rate will be given, but Omaha can get no better rate from St. Louis than $11.50&#8212;more than double the rate given St. Louis some years ago.  This $11.50 rate is good only on three days in the week.  Seventeen dollars is the rate.  It is 450 miles from Omaha to St. Louis by the Burlington, probably the longest route, and the 1-cent rate would have given a rate of $9 for the round trip, and it is understood that St. Louis could not secure the 1-cent rate.</p>

                            <p>The board of directors at yesterday's meeting was treated to the spectacle of an officer of the exposition urging and pleading that the investigating committee be headed off, and that it be not allowed to continue its investigations into the manner in which business has been conducted and of the manipulation of the concessions features of the exposition by the close corporation, composed of Carroll S. Montgomery, general counsel, and S. B. Wadley, superintendent of the concessions department.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery was the officer who strenuously <choice><sic>endeaveroed</sic><corr>endeavored</corr></choice> to have the powers of the investigating committee curtailed, and it will be remembered that Mr. Montgomery was likewise the officer who objected to any investigation in the first place, and who also suggested that it would be just as well for the board of directors not to meet any more until after the close of the exposition, but to allow the full conduct of affairs to proceed without interruption and without supervision in the hands of the few parties having them in charge.</p>
                            <p>It will also be remembered that the board of directors did not take kindly to Mt. Montgomery's suggestion, but forthwith ordered an investigation, and that the committee in its first report passed severe strictures on certain proceedings which had been taken under the direction of Mr. Montgomery.  Immediately on hearing that report, Mr. Montgomery entered a protest against the committee going into those matters, and it was finally decided to take no action on that report, pending the return of the manager of the department interested.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COMMITTEE WANTS POINTERS.</head>
                            <p>Yesterday, however, <choice><sic>th einvestigating</sic><corr>the investigating</corr></choice> committee announced, through its chairman, Thomas Kilpatrick, that it wanted explicit instructions from the full board and wanted an official interpretation of the resolution under which it was acting, so as to know whether it was to make a full and complete investigation, or whether it was to make fish of one and fowl of another and steer clear of the particular cases of injustice and favoritism that Mr. Montgomery did not want to have investigated.  Mr. Kilpatrick said he had no interest in the matter other than to advance the best interests of the exposition.  The committee had heard a great many complaints, and had investigated some of them, but there seemed to be objection in certain quarters to having these matters looked into.  It was, therefore, the desire of the committee, before submitting reports on these matters, to know whether or not the directors desired to have that information.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery said he thought the committee had gone a long ways further than was intended, and was going into matters that were not properly within their province to investigate.</p>
                            <p>"Well," said Mr. Yost, "what difference does it make if the committee is willing to spend the necessary time to hear it.  Why don't you make a motion to give the committee the widest latitude?"</p>
                            <p>"Uh&#8212;ah&#8212;yes&#8212;but," said Mr. Montgomery, who then tried to explain that litigation might grow out of some of the cases and that the interests of the exposition might be injured.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROBE TO THE BOTTOM.</head>
                            <p>The sentiment of several of the directors seemed to be, however, that a thorough investigation would have a tendency to check rather than to encourage litigation, by putting a stop to much of the cause for litigation that the system indulged in has occasioned.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery strongly contended that the powers of the investigating committee be confined to cases of actual dishonesty of officials or employes, and made the interesting assertion that "the concessions department's acts should not be investigated when such action was taken under the advice of counsel, even though the action might be wrong."</p>
                            <p>"Hasn't the investigating committee sense enough to know what the situation is in that respect and be governed accordingly?" asked Mr. Yost in a tone of pronounced disgust.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery then took a new tack and proceeded to jump on o Mr. Price, who by the way, was not present.  He said that Mr. Price was a member of the investigating committee, but was also a concessionaire and had had trouble with the concessions department, and was prejudiced against the superintendent of that department.  He said that Mr. Price was on both sides of the question and not in a <choice><sic>pasotion</sic><corr>position</corr></choice> to act fairly in the matter.  The ice cream concession row was also touched on, for the benefit of Mr. Markel.  Mr. Montgomery stated that he wanted the powers of the committee limited, and also wanted to relieve Superintendent Wadley of the concessions department of wrong intent for acts that were taken under Montgomery's advice.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Yost moved that the committee be given the widest latitude and that it be authorized to use its judgment as to going into any matters that it might deem for <choice><sic>th einterests</sic><corr>the interests</corr></choice> of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WEBSTER FOR PROBING.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Webster spoke in favor of the fullest and most searching investigation.  He said to Mr. Montgomery:  "You want to cut off the power to investigate.  We want to know.  This resolution was passed because it did provide for an investigation.  This committee has freely given its time to go into these matters, but at every meeting since the resolution was passed there has been objection to its proceeding further.  Why are you afraid of an investigation?"</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery then raised the point of no quorum, but Mr. Webster urged <choice><sic>taht</sic><corr>that</corr></choice> no such efforts be made to prevent action.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles objected to taking full power away from the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton made some very pointed remarks, and Mr. Montgomery inquired:  "Mr. Wharton, why is all this sarcasm directed at me?"</p>
                            <p>"Because you say <choice><sic>taht</sic><corr>that</corr></choice> you have advised these moves," replied Mr. Wharton.</p>
                            <p>"The president and executive committee have approved of them," protested Mr. Montgomery.</p>
                            <p>"I have a great deal of confidence in the honesty and integrity of the president and the executive committee, but," said Mr. Wharton very significantly, "if I thought they knew or approved of these moves my confidence in them would be very much shaken.  If we mean to be honest and deal fairly with our concessionaires that is one thing, and if we do not mean to do so that is another."  Mr. Wharton then made some references to Superintendent Wadley's way of doing business that were not at all complimentary.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock said he was not at all surprised at the trouble that had arisen, as a resolution providing for an investigation that would investigate had been turned down and his one passed in its place.  He did <choice><sic>ot</sic><corr>not</corr></choice> believe <choice><sic>taht</sic><corr>that</corr></choice> anything would be arrived at of material benefit until it was started over on a new basis.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery again protested, and wound up by bitterly assailing a reporter who had been unable to see that everything was good in all matters that happened <choice><sic>tob ear</sic><corr>to bear</corr></choice> the Montgomery brand.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>Messrs. Mitchcock, Webster and other directors protested against such an outbreak, insisting that it was an outrage to make an assault on an outsider, who had no right to the floor in reply, and President Wattles vigorously <sic>caled</sic> down the gentleman for his ungentlemanly expressions.</p>
                            <p>The matter was allowed to go over until the next meeting on Friday afternoon, at the suggestion of the president.</p>
                            <p>The reduced rate question was given another round.  Practically the same figures were cited pro and con, with the addition of last week's figures of attendance.  Each side insisted that it proved its case, those favoring reduced rates citing turnstile readings and cash receipts, and those opposed following Mr. Bruce's lead with estimated percentages of per capita expenditures on the part of the visitors.</p>
                            <p>Motions to apply the reduced rate for one week, to make it apply for Monday nights, and for Sundays, were defeated in turn, and it was voted to make it apply only on Thursday nights after 6 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Kilpatrick of the investigating committee reported having investigated the charges made concerning the misappropriation of postage stamps by the superintendent of the exhibits department during the summer of 1897, and the committee held that they were not sustained by the evidence.  The expert accountant's report relative to checking cash and checks was read, the statement being that there was about $16 too much on hand.  A number of recommendations relative to minor changes in the office were made.  The report was adopted, and henceforth no checks drawn against the bank account will be cashed at the office, and no employes will be allowed advances of cash against their accounts.</p>

                            <p>Commander Stedman, who is in charge of the navy exhibit at the Government building, has always had about him a large number of appreciative spectators and listeners, but the crowds were especially interested today and will probably be so until the end of the exposition.  The reason for it is that the model of the breech of a thirteen-inch gun and the model of the ship Illinois in dry dock have been put in place.</p>
                            <p>As the commander explains these two important naval features he is pressed by people on all sides and plied with questions which are always fully answered.</p>
                            <p>Recently, also, a four-inch rapid fire gun and an automobile torpedo have been added to the navy display and are naturally objects of much attention.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Laughland of the local committee preparing for the Trans-Mississippi Conference of Charities and Corrections, says that many inquiries regarding the convention are now coming in and that the prospect is that the meeting will be a good one and largely attended.  It will be September 15 to 20.  Among the prominent people who will be on the program are President Henderson of the national conference, and who will preside at this one; N. S. Rosenau of the United Hebrew societies of New York, and H. H.Hart, secretary of the national conference.</p>
                            <p>The sessions will be held in the First Congregational church.</p>

                            <p>Washington, D. C., Aug. 22.&#8212;In all probability a large contingent of Washington correspondents will pay the Omaha exposition a visit in the course of the next two weeks.  This visit was contemplated at a much earlier date, but the war coming on prevented the completion of suitable arrangements.</p>
                            <p>A considerable number of the press fraternity expressed their willingness to go, but were compelled to remain on duty in Washington to look after important developments at the capital.  It is now thought that the trip can be arranged to suit the convenience of a large number of the men.  The Baltimore &amp; Ohio has tendered the use of a special train to and from Chicago and other lines have made similar offers to provide carriage facilities for the correspondents.  Those having the excursion in charge will take up the matter in a few days with the newspaper men and all parties in interest.</p>

                            <p>The Onyz Soda Fountain company, concessionaires on the exposition grounds, secured an order in Judge Scott's court this morning restraining Constable W. R. Adams, Justice E. K. Long and David C. Trautwine from attempting to enforce an execution on a soda fountain issued out of Justice Long's court to satisfy a judgment for costs.  It is alleged that this original action was compromised and nothing was said about costs until eight days later when a judgment for costs was entered, pretending to be for the services of the custodian who was alleged to have been in charge under the first action.  The matter was set for hearing August 26, and the defendants are restrained from taking possession of the property of the plaintiff.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.</hi></head>
                            <p>Ever since the exposition opened, in fact ever since it was organized, it has been with the greatest difficulty that the directors could be gotten together at regular or special meetings in sufficient numbers to constitute a quorum to do business.  Time and time again the directory has been compelled to adjourn over and to give up its sessions altogether because its own members have not displayed enough interest to put in an attendance.</p>
                            <p>The business of the exposition is too important to permit of this neglect by the very men who have undertaken to direct its affairs.  The responsibilities resting upon the directors are too great to be thus shifted and evaded.  The exposition requires the same kind of business management that every great public and private corporation requires and it is certain that none of the absentee directors would for a moment think of neglecting their own business in such a flagrant manner.</p>
                            <p>When the original board of directors was elected for the exposition nearly two years ago there was a huge scramble to secure the positions.  Every vacancy that has occurred has been eagerly sought and awarded among competing candidates.  The directors have been most vigilant in guarding the honors and protecting the perquisites that appertain to their positions.  They have been zealous in voting free passes to themselves and their wives and careful not only to provide themselves with silver badges as insignia of their official power, but also to insist upon full recognition of the silver emblems for all gala occasions, not to mention the Midway sideshows and other exposition concessions.  But when their presence is needed to transact the pressing business of the great enterprise, not half of these be-silvered directors are in evidence.</p>
                            <p>The question naturally suggests itself, Is it not time for the absentee directors to show up and get down to business or turn in their free passes and enameled badges and make way for men who will do so?  A director of a big corporation who fails to evince any interest in its welfare is promptly asked to resign, and under our city charter a councilman who persistently absents himself from the meetings of the municipal directory renders himself subject to expulsion.</p>
                            <p>To say that the executive committee consists of capable and energetic men who can perform the duties of the full board is only beating around the bush, because the ultimate responsibility resting upon the whole exposition directory cannot thus be unloaded.  Every directors' meeting from now on should have not only a quorum, but a full attendance, or steps should be promptly taken to provide the remedy.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Des Moines day brought a good crowd this morning and the grounds were well filled long before the Capital City special pulled in with the guests of the day.  Large numbers of excursionists from other Iowa points were among the early visitors and when the Des Moines party arrived there was a liberal representation of Hawkeyes in sight.  The official party left Des Moines at 7 o'clock and it was well toward noon when it pulled into the Union depot.  Its members were received by General Manager Clarkson of the exposition, with Mayor Moores and other city officials, and escorted at once to the Auditorium, where exercises similar to those which have marked other municipal days were held.  During the long delay that preceded their arrival, the McCook band entertained the audience with an excellent program, which was elongated by several encores.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles presided and introduced Mayor Moores, who welcomed the visitors to Omaha.  He made his greeting brief on account of the hour, but explained that it lost nothing in cordiality on that account.  He stated that while the city of Omaha might derive a temporary advantage by reason of the location of the exposition, every thriving city in the west is receiving new impetus.  After these buildings have served their purpose the whole west will share equally in the advantages of the great transmississippi show.  Of no state would this prove more true than of Iowa.  Omaha and Des Moines each have a great <choice><sic>dork</sic><corr>work</corr></choice> to do in connection with the development of the west.  It is not enough that they should keep abreast of the progress of their states, but it is their duty to lead the march of progress, and the speaker prophesied that at the end of another decade each city will be doubled in population.  In conclusion the mayor disposed of the keys of the city for the twenty-eighth time, since his inauguration, and invited the visitors to take the utmost advantage of the liberty accorded them.</p>

                            <p>Mayor Macvicar of Des Moines expressed his appreciation of the neighborly greeting that the party had received in Omaha.  He stated that the commercial and industrial prosperity of the two cities depend very largely on the agricultural resources of the transmississippi country.  Both raise corn and hogs and their jobbing territory intermingles.  While they recognize Omaha as the great middle west city, they still contend for the superiority of their stat<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>In expressing the greeting of the exposition, President Wattles said that Des Moines was a great city in the midst of the most magnificent agricultural section in the union.  To those who are familiar with the wonderful fertility of its soil it is not surprising that Black Hawk wept when he saw it turned over to the white faced pioneer.  President Wattles emphasized the fact that the growth of Des Moines has been of a more solid and permanent character than that of most western cities.  It has never experienced the real estate boom and subsequent collapse.  Its affairs have always been managed conservatively and today its debt per capita is smaller than that of any other large western city.  The commercial and industrial advantages of the city were briefly sketched and in conclusion President Wattles brought out the fact that Iowa was the first state to give its official sanction to the exposition and welcomed its citizens not only as guests but as partners in the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>President Thomas Hattan of the Commercial exchange of Des Moines spoke briefly in response to President Wattles.  He eulogized the courage Omaha has exhibited in daring to undertake such an enterprise as this exposition, and declared that he is almost as proud of it as though it all belonged to Iowa.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Ward of the same organization added a few sentences in a similar vein, and then the visitors were escorted to their belated dinner.</p>

These were not exhibited, but on the strength of their statements President Wattles declared a quorum present.  The session was prolonged until long after the dinner hour by a series of lively discussions, but very little business was transacted.  The bulk of the time was occupied by another rehash of the various arguments for and against the reduced Sunday and night admissions and by a prolonged controversy relating to the limits within which the recently appointed committee of investigation should be allowed to operate.</p>
                            <p>Preliminary to the discussion of these matters the following resolutions were introduced by John L. Webster and adopted without comment:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the Transmississippi and International Exposition hold a "Peace Jubilee" under its auspices on the exposition grounds at Omaha, Neb., from the 10th day to the 15th day of October, 1898, to celebrate the victories of the army and navy in the war between the United States and Spain, and the terms of the proposed peace in the protocol between the two nations entered into by approval of the national administration.

                            <p>Resolved, That Gurdon W. Wattles, president of the Transmississippi and International Exposition be and is hereby authorized and requested either by direct communication or by the instrumentality of such persons or committees as he may see proper to call to his assistance, extend a formal invitation to be present and participate in such "Peace Jubilee," the following persons and officials:  To his excellency William McKinley, president of the United States, and members of his cabinet; to the members of the supreme court of the United States and the judges of the circuit court of the United <choice><sic>Staes</sic><corr>States</corr></choice>; to the members of the United States senate and house of representatives; to the ambassadors and ministers of foreign countries, residents in the United States; to the governors of the various states and territories of the United States with their official staff and other state officers; to the officers of the United States army and navy and other distinguished citizens; to the president of the republic of Mexico and his official family; to the governor general and other officials of the Dominion of Canada; be it further</p>

                            <p>Resolved, That Gurdon W. Wattles, president of the Transmississippi and International Exposition now being held at Omaha, United States of America, be and hereby is authorized and requested to extend in a formal manner, either by direct communication or through the State department at Washington and the American ambassador residing at London, an invitation to his royal highness, the prince of Wales, to visit the exposition during the period of the "Peace Jubilee" to be held and conducted under the auspices of the exposition, beginning the 10th day of October, 1898, at which time we expect to have with us his excellency, William McKinley, president of the United States, together with various members of his cabinet, and also the governors of the various states and territories participating in this exposition, and also distinguished statesmen and military and naval officers and a large encampment from the army and navy.

                            <p>Resolved, That we deem this invitation to his royal highness, the prince of Wales, to be peculiarly fitting and proper owing to the strong feeling of friendship existing between the United States and Great Britain during the war with Spain, just closed, and the terms of the peace proclaimed, which are made the occasion for the jubilee, and that we further believe that a visitation of his royal highness, the prince of Wales, to this exposition during the Peace Jubilee will have a tendency in a large degree to bring about a greater sympathy and stronger feeling of national relationship between the United States and Great Britain, seemingly so much desired by the publicly expressed opinions of English statesmen.

                            <head type="sub">Reduced Admission Question.</head>
                            <p>The reduced admission question was suggested by C. S. Montgomery, who moved that from now until the close of the exposition the Sunday admission should be 25 cents for adults and 15 cents for children and that the same rate should apply on Monday evenings in addition to Thursday evenings, which were already provided for.  This precipitated a renewal of the same debate that has occupied the bulk of the last dozen meetings.  Directors Kountze and Weller vigorously opposed the motion.  Thomas Kilpatrick produced the records that were available as the result of his resolution, which was adopted at the previous meeting, showing the relative attendance after 6 o'clock on each evening of last week.  These showed that the evening attendance Tuesday night was 5 per cent of the whole; Wednesday night, 9 per cent; Thursday night, 35 per cent; Friday night, 9 per cent, and Saturday night, 16 per cent.  There were 5,410 paid admissions after 6 o'clock Thursday night or more than on the other five nights combined.  At the same time the paid admissions before 6 o'clock were practically as many as on any other day of the week.  He contended that these figures furnished conclusive evidence of the advisability of the reduced evening admission.</p>
                            <p>Manager Bruce also had some figures from which he deduced that during last week 77.8 of the total admission came through the gates before 3 o'clock.  Eight and four-tenths were registered between 3 and 6 and 13.6 after 6 o'clock.  This being the case, he contended that reduced evening admissions did not pay.  He also stated that the concession receipts per capita were 10.7 cents Tuesday, 12.2 cents Wednesday, 10.25 cents Thursday and 11.4 cents Friday.  This, in his opinion, proved that the concession receipts were lighter on the reduced rate night than on any other night of the week.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock then saddled the motion with an amendment which provided for the reduced rate every night in the week.  Manager Lindsey stated that he had become convinced that a reduced rate was advisable on Sunday and two nights a week, but he was not ready to consent to the amendment.  The amendment was lost and the original motion also failed to carry by 9 to 13.</p>

                            <head type="sub">About Investigation.</head>
                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick presented the report of W. S. Streater, the expert who was employed to audit the books of the association.  This contained a detailed statement of the finances of the association as far as his investigation had carried him.  It indicated that $113.23 had been advanced to clerks and guards on account of August salaries, and that the cash account was $16 out of plumb.  The committee recommended that hereafter no cash should be advanced on account of salaries, that no checks should be paid at the office and that the cash account should be balanced at 5 o'clock every day, leaving the receipts after 5 o'clock to apply on the next day's account.  It was adopted.</p>
                            <p>The committee also submitted a report relative to a charge of misappropriation of postage stamps by the superintendent of exhibits department.  In this case it was stated that the evidence discovered had not been sufficient to sustain the charges.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion the same committee asked for instructions and thereby precipitated the <choice><sic>livliest</sic><corr>liveliest</corr></choice> discussion of the meeting.  The committee suggested that in the course of its investigations it had incidentally become familiar with several other matters which seemed to require investigation.  It specified the controversy between the Streets of Cairo, the Streets of All Nations and the exposition association, that between the ice cream concessionist and the association and certain charges preferred by W. R. Kimball, formerly director of music.  It wanted to know whether these matters were included in the scope of its authority.</p>
                            <p>C. S. Montgomery was vigorously of the negative opinion.  He urged that this committee should not interfere in matters that were in court or might get there.  He said that it was all right for the committee to look into charges that referred to specific acts of an official or employe, but it should not presume to adjudicate matters in con-<unclear reason="torn"/> between the exposition and outside <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Caspar E. Yost did not know what hurt it would do if the committee should get at the facts and moved that it be vested with full authority to look into anything that, in the opinion of its members, it was for the good of the exposition to have investigated.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Clips Its Wings.</head>
                            <p>Herman Kountze opposed giving the committee such latitude and President Wattles took occasion to say that it was not proper that this committee should take matters out of the hands of the executive committee.  In that case it would be bigger than the executive committee and the latter would be left without authority.  He suggested that if such a broad line of investigation was instituted the committee would be busy for six months after the exposition closed, when as a matter of fact all these complaints had been duly considered by the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>John C. Wharton declared that he had discovered things that had been done by superintendents of various departments that he did not believe either the president or the executive committee knew anything about.  He did not believe that they would approve them if they knew the facts and if they did know the facts and had approved them he would lose confidence in the integrity of those officials.</p>
                            <p>The discussion was prolonged along this line until 7 o'clock and then at the urgent request of President Wattles action was postponed until there was a quorum present.  The board adjourned to Friday at 4 o'clock.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Dairy Building Scene of Active Preparation and Energetic Rivalry.</head>
                            <p>Active preparations are being made for the next butter scoring contest which will take place in the Dairy building some day this week, or as soon as the butter is in place and properly cooled.  At the last scoring contest, which was last month, Iowa scored the highest, the judges giving the butter from that state ninety-seven and one-half points out of a possible 100 and it now stands the other transmississippi states in hand to beat that mark.  The Minnesota butter came in Sunday and was placed in the refrigerating cases during the night.  Yesterday it was nicely cooled and had a very fine appearance.  The consignment consists of thirty-two tubs of creamery and dairy butter.</p>
                            <p>In scoring butter the judges take into consideration flavor, body, color, salt, style of package and packing.  Each exhibitor whose butter scores over ninety-five points is entitled to a medal and a diploma.  Less than ninety points is not considered in any <choice><sic>particuler</sic><corr>particular</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>The Dairy building is being put in perfect condition, so far as the freezing in the cases is concerned and the exhibitors feel perfectly satisfied.  The temperature can be reduced to 31 degrees and kept there, providing the engines are run night and day, which is now being done.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska exhibit, which is the largest one in the building, and which will occupy all of the space on the north side of the interior is arriving, and is being put in place by William A. Carpenter, a butter expert from York.  The entire exhibit will be installed by the last of the present week and will present a very fine appearance.  It is made up of the product of a number of creameries and dairies, but in making it all of them have lost their individual identity and are shown as having come from the Ak-Sar-Ben creameries, which everybody knows, means Nebraska.</p>

                            <p>The plans for the choral congress, which will be held in connection with the exposition September 23 to 28, are well toward completion, and with sufficient co-operation on the part of the choirs the event will not only be an interesting feature of the exposition, but a source of profit to the singers who will participate.  This will be an exceptional opportunity for the members of choirs within easy distance of Omaha to see the exposition and at the same time enjoy a valuable musical instruction.  The Transportation department has secured very low railroad rates and the executive committee has voted to admit them to the grounds free of charge.  The Bureau of Public Comfort will look after the comfort of the visitors and see that they secure accommodations at reasonable rates.  They will also enjoy the advantage of meeting with other choral societies hearing profitable discussions on topics connected with their work and singing in a grand chorus of 600 voices with one of the best bands in the world.  The chorus will be limited to 500 voices in addition to the regular exposition chorus, and those who wish to participate should correspond at once with Thomas J. Kelly, superintendent of the bureau of music.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday Texas was represented at the exposition by J. Ferdinand McCan of Victoria and with him he brought a painting which has found a place in the Texas exhibit in the west end of the Agricultural building.  The painting represents a typical Texas farm scene.  A bull occupies the prominent place in the foreground, while to the right and left are broad acres covered with growing grain.  In the rear in a beautiful grove is the home of the owner of the farm.</p>
                            <p>J. Ferdinand was formerly an Omaha boy and clerked in a Douglas street art store.  While here he painted some, but upon going to Texas a number of years ago he studied art and at the Midwinter fair held in San Francisco he placed on exhibition a picture, "A Trysting Place Near Sweet Tralee," that was awarded the first medal in the landscape class.</p>
                            <p>After leaving Omaha Mr. McCan not only earned fame as an artist, but he secured a fortune and is now one of the wealthy men of the Lone Star state.  Some years after going there he married the daughter of one of the wealthy stockmen and with the money that naturally came along he has had an opportunity to push himself to the front as an artist.</p>

                            <p>Douglas county is making a great showing with its fruit in the Horticultural building and just now it is making a specialty of peaches.  Yesterday morning Superintendent Walker brought in some fine specimens from the farm of J. P Brown, near Florence, including the Stump and the Champion.  On one branch less than three feet long there were thirty-five perfect peaches, none of which were less than three inches in diameter.</p>
                            <p>Oregon is sending on fresh fruit almost daily now.  Plums seem to be the fad just now and they include the Prunus Samonia and Columbian.  Of the latter there is a stock twenty-two inches long that carries seventy-six fine specimens.  Some Bettigheimer apples are shown and they are whoppers, measuring six inches through and weighing four pounds each.</p>

One limb cut from a 6-year-old tree bears seventy-five fine peaches, while there is a pomegranate vine fourteen feet long that carries twenty-six fine specimens of the fruit.  There are some onions that weigh as high as three pounds each.  The vegetables are all of the second crop of the season and are larger than the same kinds of vegetables raised and matured in the north.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Omaha Citizens Very Warmly Endorse the Exposition's Undertaking.</head>
                            <p>The preparations for the Peace Jubilee to be held in this city to celebrate the conclusion of the war with Spain have progressed so rapidly toward a successful solution that the people of the city are hardly ready to believe that the event is real.  They all appear to treat the enterprise as one too good to be true.  The idea was proposed and arrangements to carry it into effect have been completed so rapidly that the celebration almost stands before the public in its fullest scope before it was generally understood the enterprise was to be undertaken.  A number of citizens were asked their views of the jubilee and the result of those interviews appear below:</p>
                            <p>Mayor Frank E. Moores:  There is no more fitting place in this country for a peace jubilee than in this city.  The exposition is eminently an enterprise of peace, and it is proper that in connection with it this great celebration should be held.  Properly managed, as I believe it will be, with a fair rate by the railroads, and the presence of President McKinley, 200,000 people will come to Omaha.  It will be a great event, and I will do all I can to help make it a success.</p>
                            <p>General John C. Cowin:  It will be grand affair and should prove to be one of the greatest assemblages ever gathered together in the west.  I hope there will be nothing occur to interfere with the president's coming, as his presence will be a great attraction in itself.  However, we shall undoubtedly have other distinguished leaders of the government and officers of the army and navy, so that the peace jubilee may be held anyway.</p>
                            <p>Edward Hayden: If it is carried out on the lines mentioned it will be a big thing.  I want to see it a success, for it will be the event of a lifetime.  I have been fearful that Chicago would anticipate us and get the glory for the celebration, but I believe it has gone far enough now, with President McKinley's promise to attend, to make this the official celebration and give to Omaha all the credit attaching to the success of the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick:  It is a glorious idea, and Mr. Rosewater deserves much credit for his part in it.  I never was much in favor of the war, but now that it is over I am glad there will be an opportunity to celebrate the coming of peace.  It will be the biggest thing that ever happened for Omaha.  I would suggest that there be elaborate musical programs during the week, that the celebration may take on the character of praise.</p>
                            <p>George H. Thummel, United States marshal:  It will be fine.  It will bring more people to Omaha than the city has ever seen.  Now if the government could be induced to send a few more regiments of volunteers to Omaha in addition to the Second regiment, which has been ordered home, that they might be used in connection with President McKinley's visit, it will furnish one of the greatest celebrations ever witnessed in the west.  The peace jubilee has been conceived in wisdom and I believe it will develop into a grand success.</p>
                            <p>Euclid Martin, postmaster:  I know little of what has been done in <choice><sic>refence</sic><corr>reference</corr></choice> to the subject, other than the published announcement of the coming of the president.  That alone will be an important feature.  During my last eastern trip I found the democrats and republicans vied with each other in showing admiration for Mr. McKinley, even among those democrats who voted against the president at the election.  I believe this feeling also prevails in the west and thousands will come to Omaha to honor the man whom the public generally believes handled the war with wisdom and brought it to a successful close.</p>
                            <p>J. E. Markel:  I am in favor of any effort which will tend to insure the success of the enterprise, so long as it has received so favorable a start.  It will be the biggest thing we ever attempted and as a member of the exposition directory I will vote for any measure to help the work along.</p>
                            <p>Oscar B. Hillis, clerk of the United States courts:  If they really carry it out as contemplated it will be a great thing.  This will especially be true if President McKinley comes to Omaha as announced.  It will be one of the best things for Omaha ever undertaken.</p>
                            <p>T. J. Nolan:  It will be the crowning event of the exposition and with the presence of the president, which has been promised, it will partake of a national character and Omaha will be advertised more than at any time in its history.  I think Mr. Rosewater deserves considerable credit for his work in behalf of the event.</p>
                            <p>E. E. Benedict:  It will be a winner for Omaha and with the increased attendance which will naturally come to the exposition about that time of the year the jubilee will bring more people to Omaha than the city ever held before during one week.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST</head>
                            <head type="sub">Mayor MacVicar Leads Something Like a Thousand of His Fellow-townsmen to the Great Transmississippi Fair.</head>
                            <p>About 1,000 of the good people of Des Moines came to Omaha this morning to see the exposition.  Five hundred of them occupied eight coaches of a special train on the Rock Island road and made scheduled time between the two cities, which is interpreted by the visitors to mean that they cannot be lost in the wild chase through life, whether it be on a train or in the pursuits of pleasure.  The others came in on the regular trains.  They had evidently heard of the swift gait established by the Omaha reception committees and came determined to ever keep in sight of the procession.  They reported the ride a dusty and dirty one, but alighted from the train with eyes wide open that nothing might be missed which was worth the seeing.</p>
                            <p>In the party were the following city officials:  Mayor John Macvicar, Alderman J. G. Olmsted, W. S. Hall and John Loveridge; S. M. King, engineer for the Board of Public Works; S. W. Baker, deputy auditor; S. A. Martin, deputy clerk; H. T. Gross, license collector; William Burnett, chief of the fire department, and Miss Margaret Turner, the mayor's private secretary.  Others in the party were Thomas Hatton and Milo Ward, president and secretary, respectively, of the Commercial exchange; J. W. Hill, ex-president, and H. B. Hedges, a director, of the exchange; G. B. Bartwick, president of the Manufacturers' and Jobbers' association; Secretary of State Dobson and I. E. Wilson and Miss Wilson.</p>
                            <p>The special train was met by Mayor Frank E. Moores, City Clerk Higby, City Treasurer Edwards, Councilmen Lobeck, Burmester, Bechel and Karr, Mayor's Secretary Adams, Chief Redell of the fire department, General Manager Clarkson and Press Commissioner Richardson of the exposition.  The official portion of the excursion was placed on a special trolley car and transferred at once to the Auditorium of the exposition, where it was formerly received.  The party was then brought back to the city, stopping on the way at the Omaha Brewing association's plant, where entertainment was furnished by that establishment of such character as might be supposed to be relished by an energetic lot of people from a prohibition state.  From there the visitors were taken to the Murray hotel, and later to the city hall, where an informal reception was held, and the guests shown through that building.</p>
                            <p>The other members of the excursion lost no time looking at President Burt's architectural masterpiece, but hastened across the way to the new Burlington depot, <choice><sic>generusly</sic><corr>generously</corr></choice> accepting the former as a freight repository, and passing through the beautiful rotunda of the new depot, complimenting the beauty of the winding staircase and the mosaic floors and granite pillars, took the cars for the exposition grounds.  Some of them had friends in the city who were at the station to meet them, but the majority of them were unhampered by social obligations and pulled out for the grounds as fast as they could find means of transportation.</p>
                            <p>The Des Moines special will leave on its return trip Wednesday afternoon, but many of the party will remain several days to thoroughly view the exposition and will return on regular trains.</p>
                            <p>The excursionists will not return on any special train.  They will go back home on the regular trains, as the return traffic will probably be distributed over several days.  The rates made for the excursionists are 1 cent per mile on tickets with a limit of two days, and one fare for the round trip, somewhat higher, for tickets with the return limit extended until twelve days.  District Passenger Agent Stewart of Des Moines says most of the people from that city had heard so many good reports of the exposition that they wanted to stay here longer than two days, and accordingly bought the tickets good for twelve days.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">NO QUESTION OF SUCCESS.</hi></head>
                            <p>From some unknown source the report has cropped out in Boston that the Omaha exposition is not receiving the support necessary to success.  One sympathetic Boston paper in a recent issue says:  "It would be a matter for regret if the Omaha exposition were compelled now to close its doors for lack of popular support, especially as the reports of the exposition have been unanimously to the effect that it is well worth a visit from all Americans who can afford to make the trip."</p>
                            <p>We hasten to assure our Boston friends and all others who may be laboring under the same delusion that they need not be at all solicitous about the success of the exposition.  The exposition was an assured success before it even opened its gates.  It started out under more auspicious circumstances than any other similar undertaking.  No other great exposition was organized, constructed and brought up to its public inauguration without bonding its gate receipts in advance or mortgaging its resources.  No other great exposition ever paid running expenses and contributed steadily to the extinction of its floating debt from the very outset.  No other great exposition so successfully overcame so many discouraging obstacles or so soon entered upon the period of good financial returns which the Omaha exposition has for some time been enjoying.</p>
                            <p>There is, therefore, not the remotest possibility of the Omaha exposition closing its doors one single day ahead of the allotted time.  On the contrary, if any change is made it will be in response to the demand for an extension of the exposition period for the accommodation of the people who will not have had enough of it.  The exposition is here to stay and is not only well worth a visit from all Americans who can afford the trip, but will amply repay the inhabitants of any other quarter of the world for a journey half way around the globe.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Money Left in the Exposition Fund Will Be Expended in Pursuance of the Idea at the Discretion of the Board.</head>
                            <p>A grand Douglas County day at the exposition some time in October is being considered by the county commissioners.  For this purpose, among other things, the board met this morning as a committee with the heads of departments of the Douglas county exhibit to get an idea of the financial situation.  There is about $5,300 now in the exposition fund, and it is thought that probably $1,000 will be left over after all the estimates for running the exhibit through the exposition period were subtracted, taking out also the $1,000 in premiums for the county live stock exhibit.</p>
                            <p>President James Walsh and Secretary D. C. Christie of the county exhibit were on hand; also Superintendent E. H. Walker of the horticultural feature, G. W. Hervey who has charge of the agricultural branch; Jacob H. Hess, whose department is the floral display, and Expert August Davidson of the apiary exhibit.  After a consultation with each of them it was figured out that there would hardly be $1,000 left in the fund, still that it would be possible to have a day set apart for Douglas county, provided the most rigorous economy were practised.  The commissioners will therefore communicate with the exposition management to see what day can be so designated.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Cool weather and a variety of attractions are in a measure responsible for a goodly crowd at the exposition grounds this morning.  It is one of the best morning assemblages yet noted on the ground, and seems to indicate that the tide which set in last week is slowly but steadily swelling.  The total admissions yesterday were reasonably satisfactory, and the prospect is that they will be passed in the total today.</p>
                            <p>The first of the four school children's excursions that are scheduled for the last four days of this week came in on the Elkhorn this morning and brought about 400 thoroughly happy children to spend the day at the exposition.  The youthful excursionists occupied extra cars attached to the regular train and were recruited mainly from York, Fremont and the intermediate stations.  The plan of organizing them into small parties, each in charge of one or more adult chaperons, which gave such satisfactory results on previous occasions, was again followed, and in this way the exuberant spirits of the small visitors were kept within bounds and they were kept out of trouble.  A representative of the Admissions department went to York last night and came in with the children, thus avoiding the necessity of holding them in line at the gate while they were provided with tickets, and the party was hustled through without a minute's delay.  No effort was made to bore the children with formal exercises, but they were made welcome at the Boys' and Girls' building and then turned loose to enjoy their holiday according to their individual tastes.</p>

                            <p>The general attendance also showed a marked increase today.  Every Wednesday and Thursday is signalized by a large influx of farmers, who invariably select the middle of the week in which to visit any sort of a show.  These have been the big days of nearly every week, except when some big feature interfered, and the crowds that were massed at the entrance this forenoon indicated that the rule will hold good.  By 9 o'clock the arrivals were in full flow and it was difficult to find standing room on a northbound car north of Cuming street.  There were groups of people waiting on nearly every corner in addition to the continual procession from down town.  By noon the crowd looked fully as big as on the biggest day of last week, and soon after it was reinforced by a large party of country editors and their families who visited the grounds as the guests of the World-Herald.  They were conducted at once to the Markel cafe, where lunch was served and followed by a formal program of toasts and short speeches.</p>

                            <p>Since the participation of President McKinley and the members of his cabinet in the great Peace Jubilee is considered assured, exposition officials are planning to extend the scope of the affair to the utmost limit.  Measures will be taken to secure the attendance of as many members of the house and senate as possible, and a general effort will be made to add to these distinguished guests as many representatives of the various other branches of the government as possible, and a general effort will be made to add to these distinguished guests as many representatives of the various other branches of the government as possible.  It is believed that this occasion will bring together the most notable gathering of government officials that has ever assembled away from the Atlantic seaboard and this in itself will be sufficient to insure an immense attendance.</p>
                            <p>Possibilities of securing the presence of some of the leaders of the army and navy whose personalities have become familiar during the recent war are also being canvassed.  In case it should appear evident that the United States commissions in Cuba and Porto Rico will complete their labors during September, it is believed that it might be possible to induce the government to allow at least two or three prominent representatives of each department to take a trip to the exposition.  This would give them a well earned vacation and it is also urged that it would be eminently fitting that the men who have contributed to peace by their heroic fighting qualities should be represented when the advent of peace is formally celebrated.  It is also suggested that it might not be among the impossibilities to secure the presence of Admiral Cervera, but all these plans are tacitly left in abeyance until the situation is further developed.</p>

                            <p>Sioux City day will be celebrated tomorrow and General Manager Clarkson has been assured that fully 1,000 excursionists will come from the Iowa city to push the good thing along.  They will arrive on special trains during the forenoon, and at 11 o'clock the usual exercises will be held in the Auditorium.  Mayor Moores will once more dispose of the keys of the city, and General Manager Clarkson will deliver an address of welcome in behalf of the exposition.  Appropriate responses by members of the visiting party and music by the McCook band will complete the program.  In the evening the spectacular fantasie, "The Spanish-American War," will be repeated on the Plaza, followed with a pyrotechnical display.  The Indian encampment, the life saving exhibition and the usual band concerts will assist to entertain the visitors, and the 25-cent admission will be in force after 6 o'clock to induce the addition of a big local crowd.</p>

                            <p>One of John R. Key's magnificent paintings of the main court is now on exhibition at the Whitmore gallery on Dodge street.  This picture is similar to the one which was presented to President McKinley by Manager Rosewater.  It represents a full view of the court from the eastern Peristyle and conveys a scarcely less accurate idea of the spectacle than view of the exposition itself.  Every detail of the architecture, the decorations and landscapes is perfectly reproduced and the crowd seems almost alive, so accurately has the artist caught the inspiration of the moving panorama.  In addition to the picture mentioned Mr. Key is about to publish twelve views of the exposition which are equally lifelike reproductions of the principal points of interest about the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Success of the New Spectacular Fantasie is Proven from the First.</head>
                            <p>The spectacular fantasie, "The Spanish-American War," which was presented on the Plaza last night proved to be a worthy successor to the battle piece that Phinney's band made so popular with exposition crowds..  The stereopticon views effectively illustrated the music and the black clouds that shut out the stars emphasized the effect of the pictures and the pyrotechnical finale.  The audience was big enough to fill the entire Plaza and sufficiently enthusiastic to indicate a still more successful presentation of the same specialty Thursday night.</p>
                            <p>Preliminary to the fantasie the Mexican band rendered a short first part in which the exposition chorus also figured to the extent of a very satisfactory rendition of Pinsuti's pretty serenade, "Sleep, My Beloved."  Then the electric lights in the band stand were turned out and a canvas lowered from the arch on which the stereopticon views were thrown.  The opening views were accompanied by American airs played by the McCook band and a Mexican patriotic melody by the Mexican band.  Meanwhile the stereopticon views carried the audience through the stirring scenes before and after the destruction of the Maine.  The Maine was first shown ready to leave New York harbor with Captain Sigsbee sitting in his cabin.  Havana harbor, Morro castle, the palace gardens and other Cuban views were shown in rapid succession and then the Maine was seen idly swinging at anchor in the harbor.  Then a view of the crew of the vessel was thrown on the canvas while the male chorus sang "The Soldier's Farewell."  The clock tolls out 9 o'clock, the hour at which the fateful disaster occurred, and a few minutes after the explosion was graphically suggested by a succession of bombs.  The view was quickly shifted to show the Maine at the moment the explosion occurred and then a number of views illustrated the funeral of the victims and finally brought the audience to the graves of the dead sailors.  The next picture showed Uncle Sam ready to avenge the

                            destruction of the battleship and the principal vessel of the Atlantic fleet quickly passed in review over the canvas.  Portraits of Sampson, Dewey, Hobson, Schley and Generals Shafter and Miles were also displayed, while the signal, "Remember the Maine," was floated from a small flag staff on the band stand.  Then the portraits of famous American generals and statesmen from Washington to Grant were displayed and a handsome likeness of President McKinley concluded the entertainment.  At the same time a large flag was flung out from the top of the band stand and the finale, "Star Spangled Banner," was accompanied by a brilliant display of fireworks.  The enthusiasm of the crowd was kept thoroughly aroused during the entire performance and the applause was continuous.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Program Promises to Be Possessed of Great Interest.</head>
                            <p>Bohemian day, which is next Saturday, will be one of the red letter days in the history of the exposition.  An extensive program for it has been arranged by the Bohemian societies of this city and South Omaha jointly.  The attendance is expected to be one of the biggest yet seen at the exposition, for Bohemians from all portions of this and neighboring states will be here in great numbers.</p>
                            <p>The features of the day that will probably be of the greatest public interest will be the street parade.  In this will appear many carriages carrying visiting and local notables of Bohemian nativity, a dozen handsome floats and hundreds of men marching on foot, the latter being members of Bohemian societies.  The parade will form at Thirteenth <choice><sic>adn</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> William streets, will proceed on Thirteenth to Pacific, to Tenth, to Farnam, to Sixteenth, to Cuming, to Nineteenth and then to Twentieth out to the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The exercises of the day will take place at the Auditorium on the exposition grounds.  Mayor Moores will deliver the address of welcome, and other addresses will then be made by C. Duras of Wilbur, the republican nominee for secretary of state; Prof. B. Shimek of Iowa City; Mrs. Humpal-Zeman of Chicago, editor of the Bohemian Ladies' Journal, and Edward Rosewater.  The music will be furnished by a chorus of some fifty voices that has been in practice for months.</p>
                            <p>On Sunday the Bohemian Turning society will meet in convention with delegates from all parts of the country.  On the same day the turning exercises will commence upon the grounds at Turner park at Thirteenth and Vinton streets, and will continue on Monday.  In these contests athletes from all sections of the transmississippi country will be in competition.</p>
                            <p>On Sunday night the local dramatic society will give a performance upon the stage in National hall.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Springs a Winter Plum on the Unsuspecting Horticultural Experts.</head>
                            <p>Over in the Horticulture building Nebraska got to the front yesterday and exhibited a variety of fruit not heretofore seen.  Winter plums were put upon the tables for the first time and they proved a curiosity to many of the old fruit growers, who had never heard of anything of the kind before.  The plums are nearly as large as the Idaho prune and are of a deep purple.  They are left on the trees until they drop off of their own accord.  Even they are almost as hard as rocks.  After being picked up they are packed away in boxes and barrels and placed in storage.  Late in the fall or early in the winter they become mellow and take on a flavor that is equal to that of ripe plums picked at this season of the year.</p>
                            <p>The winter plums have never gone upon the market in this section of the country and it is not likely that they will for some time, as they are very scarce.  Those shown were raised by Fred Behlin, a farmer residing near Columbus, who secured them by experimenting with other varieties, and to his surprise he has secured a plum that will keep as well as a winter apple.  He has no patent upon the experiment, still he is not telling anyone how he attained the results that have rewarded his efforts.</p>
                            <p>Douglas county has brought out the first Concord grapes of the season.  The specimens are good-sized and are growing in unusually large clusters.</p>
                            <p>The exhibitors in the Horticulture building are up in arms on account of a dealer in cheap jewelry having secured a location in one of the aisles and they have all petitioned the exposition management to have the individual removed.  Heretofore they have succeeded in keeping the fakirs and hucksters out of the building, but with the advent of this one they fear that they will soon be as many in the place as there are in most of the other buildings.</p>

                            <p>There is a probability that before the end of another week the personnel of the Indian congress will be nearly doubled, as the reports received indicate that many additional Indians are about ready to start for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Captain Mercer of the Indian congress has received word from the Oklahoma country that seventy-five of the Sacs and Foxes from that territory will leave their homes for Omaha next Monday.  These Indians were originally a part of the Sacs and Foxes of Iowa, but some seventy-five years ago they broke away and went south, where they have since resided.  Since then they have become plains Indians and are much different in every respect from the Sacs and Foxes who come from the vicinity of Tama City, Ia.</p>
                            <p>A band of twenty-five Kickapoos are expected from Oklahoma next week, together with a party of Pawnees.  The latter are great horsemen and will display some of their ability in that line after they get here.  If the plans do not fail, they will show what a human being can do in the way of fancy riding.</p>

                            <p>Although Canada is several hundred miles from Omaha, the residents of the Dominion do not propose to be outdone by the states in making fine and attractive displays at the exposition.  Some weeks ago Canada put in a mineral, forestry and agricultural exhibit that has been the admiration of the multitudes.  Now it comes to the front with a fruit exhibit that is equally attractive.  The display is made in International hall and covers two long tables and is much greater than that made by some of the states that are near by.  The exhibit contains twenty varieties of apples, six of crab apples, four of pears, eight of peaches, twelve of tame plums and six of tomatoes, besides potatoes, cabbage and all classes of other vegetables.</p>
                            <p>Part of the Canadian fruit exhibit comes from British Columbia, 1,800 miles northwest from Omaha and from what has sometimes been designated as a cold country.  Notwithstanding this designation, this identical province is showing peaches and pears as large as those grown in the south.</p>

                            <p>Today is the thirteenth anniversary of the establishment of the Omaha Evening World, which was later consolidated with the Omaha Herald.  In honor of the anniversary today has been designated as World-Herald day at the exposition, and the World-Herald celebrates it by entertaining its good friends, the editors of Nebraska and their wives.</p>
                            <p>The World-Herald is happy in the knowledge that it enjoys the friendship of the country press, and it has often had occasion to acknowledge substantial benefits arising from this friendship.  It is meet and proper that the Nebraska editors should be tendered the freedom of the exposition grounds, for to them in great measure is due the success of that great enterprise.  They have advertised it in season and out of season and have unselfishly advanced its interests.  To them the management owes a debt of gratitude that "complimentary" tickets will not cancel.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska owes much to the country press.  The country press has been the pioneer in all good works that have for their aim the advancement of Nebraska's material interests.  And Omaha is especially indebted to this same agency for much in the way of progress and growth.</p>
                            <p>The World-Herald welcomes the newspaper men and their good wives, sisters and sweethearts on behalf of Omaha and for itself.  It joins with Omaha's progressive and appreciative citizens in wishing them an enjoyable visit, and hopes that they will come oftener and remain longer.</p>

                            <p>Concessionaire Monk of the lagoon gondolas has gone into court over the assault made by the guards on Sunday on himself and one of his men.  He insists that <choice><sic>thethe</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> guards greatly exceeded their powers when not clothed with police authority and seriously violated the law.</p>
                            <p>A touch of prudery was manifested on the grounds yesterday when the guards were sent out to round up and bring in the netoscopes and artoscopes that have been displaying views of living pictures and reproductions of famous paintings and statuary.  It was stated that an order had been received from headquarters to this effect on the ground that the pictures were immoral.  In view of the fact that not one of <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> pictures begins to compare with some of the sights in no less than half a dozen of the concessions on the grounds, the action occasioned considerable comment.</p>
                            <p>A new wrinkle was introduced in the life saving exhibition on the lagoon yesterday.  When the life boat was overturned the crew underneath held the craft bottom side up for some minutes.  The delay suggested that <choice><sic>somethi</sic><corr>something</corr></choice> was wrong and a number of the spectators were getting very uneasy when the boat finally righted and the crew came up smiling.  They had been having a pleasant picnic in the air chamber formed by the overturned boat, but a good many did not know it and their reappearance above the water lifted a burden from many minds.  The exhibition was witnessed by one of the largest crowds since the features was put on, and the white-clad life savers were liberally applauded.</p>
                            <p>Exposition red tape has caused considerable complaint around the Press building the past few hot days.  The ice supply is inadequate and ironclad rules stand in the way of supplementing it.  The ice concessionaire says he is helpless, and a succession of complaints have been referred from one official to another and the right one has not yet been found.  In the meantime visiting press representatives draw a quart of warm water from the tanks and sit down to write hot things about the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Patriotism is higher than partisanship and the press is higher than politics.  Yesterday the press of Nebraska was exalted at the exposition.  Hundreds of its representatives were together here.  They stood for papers of all party connections, yet in the whole day no inquiry was made about the politics of any, and the men who assembled were recognized only as a force beneficial to the commonwealth, salutary to the whole republic and essential to the existence of free and enlightened government.</p>
                            <p>It was called World-Herald day at the exposition.  The occasion was the celebration of the thirteenth anniversary of the founding of the Evening World, which grew to be the World-Herald.  It was this celebration, but every editor who was there, congratulating the individual paper, felt that it was more.  It was a sort of Fourth of July of Nebraska journalism.  It was the press of the whole state that was entertained.  It was the press of the whole state that felt proud.  It was the press of the whole state that was addressed.  It was the press of the whole state that responded.  It was the press of the whole state that was complimented.</p>

                            <p>As to the World-Herald itself, superstition seemed to have been left out, if indeed at any time it ever plays a part, for though it was a thirteenth anniversary, yet the figures as given by the founder of the Evening World and the proprietor of the World-Herald showed that it was a celebration, so far as the one paper was concerned, of a business multiplied by two times seven and an original influence increased fourteen-fold.</p>
                            <p>The editors of Nebraska had been invited to visit the exposition as the guests of the World-Herald.  Their wives were invited.  Their children were invited.  Almost 300 of them were here.  They came in on the early morning and forenoon trains, and, as advised, assembled at the Millard hotel.  Most of them were there by 10 o'clock.  They were there met by a reception committee consisting of R. L. Metcalfe, W. M. Maupin, R. W. Richardson, A. L. Clark, R. C. Craven, D. H. Bradley, E. C. Hunt, H. C. Richmond, Mrs. R. L. Metcalfe, Miss Ellenore Dutcher, Mrs Elta Matheson, Mrs. A. L. Clark, Mrs. E. C. Hunt, Mrs. W. M. Maupin, Mrs. D. H. Bradley, Mrs. R. C. Craven, Mrs. Charles H. Marple, Miss C. E.

                            <p>Each guest was decorated with the little press badge used by the exposition and a blue ribbon, which bore:</p>

                            <p>Two hours were spent in introductions and conversation while the Nebraska Brigade band of McCook gave a concert under the balcony of the hotel.  At the end of that time a special street railway train of six of the best cars that the Omaha Street Railway company has on its tracks was pulled up in front of the hotel and the whole company, with the band in the lead, proceeded to the exposition grounds.  The music and the lively conversation aboard attracted much attention from the people on the streets, with here and there a cheer for the imposing procession.</p>
                            <p>The stop was at the Horticulture building entrance, where the line of march was taken up on foot, the helmeted and brightly <choice><sic>suied</sic><corr>suited</corr></choice> band playing, to the Markel cafe.</p>

                            <p>The upper floor of the north wing of the cafe would not hold all the guests, so about half a hundred were seated at the tables down stairs, coming above when the toast program began.  Each one, as he took his seat, found at his plate a souvenir in the form of a little book containing handsome half-tone views of all the exposition buildings and many of the scenes of the exposition through the summer.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock, proprietor of the World-Herald, was the toastmaster.  He opened by saying that, as it was the custom at all religious services to precede the regular order by announcements, he would begin by announcing the attractions in store for the visitors.  They were that the Midway would be open to all the guests until midnight; that at hours which he named band concerts would be given; that at 4 o'clock most of them would have an opportunity to see something new in the life-saving exhibition; that at 5 o'clock the ladies of the bureau of entertainment would receive the wives of the newspaper men and their husbands; that in the evening fireworks by the World-Herald would be put up against the sky with free seats for the editors; that Thursday, at 2 p. m., the steamer Jacob Richtman wanted to carry the editors and their families to Florence and back, and desired nothing for doing it.  Mr. Hitchcock said that the Midway represented with its ups and downs, its good things and its disappointing things, though the latter were hard to find, a story of human life, and he urged that no one miss it.</p>
                            <p>Just here Mr. Richardson arose to say that all of the guests would be welcome at the Press building, and he hoped that they would at their good pleasure leave their names on the register there.</p>
                            <p>Continuing, Mr. Hitchcock thanked Mr. Richardson for the invitation, and, speaking on behalf of the World-Herald, said that in casting about for some method of celebrating the thirteenth anniversary of the Evening World, he could think of no more appropriate way than to invite his professional brothers and sisters of Nebraska to come and see the great exposition.  Why the World-Herald, as the World had become, should celebrate an anniversary hardly needed an explanation.  In 1885 the World was established by a few young men, almost all of whom had had no newspaper experience, and that the paper had eked out an existence since then was sufficient cause for celebration.  Those publishing newspapers in Nebraska for several years would know what publishing a paper in Omaha during the boom, the crop failure and the depression period meant.  At first it was estimated that the cost of publishing the paper would be $50 a day, but its expenses now were $700 a day.  This difference showed the wonderful growth of both the paper and the state.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WELCOME OF WATTLES.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock concluded by introducing President Wattles of the exposition, who said that, though he had delivered as many as thirty-five addresses of welcome, none of them had been more cordial than this.  When the exposition movement was inaugurated in the <choice><sic>midt</sic><corr>midst</corr></choice> of drouth, panic and despair and the proposition was made that $1,000,000 be raised for the enterprise most shook their heads and said it could never be done.  And when the legislature of Nebraska was asked to make an appropriation the legislators hesitated, and but for the support of the press of the state the commonwealth would have disgraced itself by making no appropriation.  For this alone the country press was entitled to the thanks of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles referred to the project for a grand peace jubilee on the exposition grounds from October 9 to 16, and asked that this great event be heralded, as it deserved to be, by the press of the state.  The exposition was a success.  It had opened its gates without a dollar of bonded <choice><sic>indebtednes</sic><corr>indebtedness</corr></choice> and in twenty days would be free from any debt of any kind.</p>
                            <p>It had shown that the <choice><sic>Untied</sic><corr>United</corr></choice> States was big and strong enough to carry on successfully a war with one of the oldest kingdoms in the world and also portray within its borders the greater triumphs of peace.  He mentioned the welcome which it was the intention to extend to the Nebraska boys when they came back from the front, and in this connection spoke with noticeable pride and emotion of Captain Jones of the Twenty-second infantry, who had come back from Santiago with a Spanish bullet in his leg, and who had a seat of honor at the table.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CAPTAIN JONES CHEERED.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock here said that while Captain Jones was not a newspaper man in the ordinary sense, yet he was at the table because he was the accredited representative of the "El Caney Dispatch," and as such he had been admitted by card at the gate.  The cheering that greeted this statement ended with calls for Jones, and he responded briefly.  He declared that he had never before faced an audience, leaving for the visitors to remember well that he had many times faced an enemy.  It had been his lot, he said, to do what he was told to do, and this he had done at Santiago.  He could, he continued, say nothing new about Santiago, because all the events there had been covered by newspaper correspondents, but he acknowledged the kindness and graciousness of the remarks that had just been made about him and of the ovation which had just been extended (for he had been cheered and cheered again as he arose to speak.)  His wife sat by his side.</p>
                            <p>"This occasion," said Mr. Hitchcock, "would not have been perfect, and indeed it would not have been proper, without the presence of the pioneer of newspaper men in Nebraska, the man whom editors have modeled after, and the one who knew enough to retire from the newspaper business in time to enjoy his middle age amid the comfortable surroundings which he deserved&#8212;Dr. George L. Miller, the founder of the Omaha Herald&#8212;who will respond to the toast, 'Seedtime and Harvest of Newspaperdom.'"</p>
                            <p>Dr. Miller was warmly applauded as he arose.  "I claim brotherhood and full identity with you all," said he.  "I thank the toastmaster for his gracious allusion to me, and I want to join him in extending welcome on this occasion as well as receiving it.  I want to thank him also for doing what I regard as an important public service in inviting the editors of Nebraska and their wives here today.  There was a well-grounded apprehension as to what might happen in bringing so large a number of brainy men to the exposition.  Something, it was thought, might happen to the exposition, and it was faintly surmised that the public morals might be imperiled.  (Laughter and applause.)  This surmise received support when it was <unclear reason="torn"/>

                            great sense of relief.  (Laughter and applause.)  I see my friend Edgar Howard down there.  Taking him as a type, what might have occurred had all these editors been turned loose on the Midway unattended and unrestrained by their wives?  (Laughter again.)  If it were not for the wives the editors might not know as much as the camels, which do not know enough to lie down when overloaded."</p>

                            <p>And then there was more laughter, for the doctor did not seem disposed to be serious, but just here he changed for a while and made short reference to the trials of early journalism in Nebraska and the requirements of the journalist of today.  He was listened to with much serious interest when he said that by the fortunes of war the United States had come into the control of far-away possessions which were dangerous to say the least.  Vast questions were presented.  Should the people of the United States undertake to absorb and control inferior races and teach self-government to people who, so far as yet known, were incapable of self-government?  It was the plain duty of the editors of the country to study the questions presented and compel the servants of the people at Washington to obey the public will.</p>
                            <p>And here Dr. Miller reverted to the Midway again, urging the wives to keep close to their husbands and not allow them to get beyond the scope of their immediate control and call.  With this caution he concluded, and every editor there, democratic, populist, free silver republican and republican, clapped his hands in honor of Dr. Miller.</p>

                            <p>The toastmaster here declared that while he was always desirous of taking to himself all the credit he could, a sense of justice constrained him to say that he would have no credit for the presence of ladies on this occasion.  When he had gone upstairs to talk with the editor, Mr. Metcalfe, about this celebration he had in response to an inquiry said that he had made no provision for the wives and the lady friends of the editors.  Mr. Metcalfe had told him that if this was so he might just as well give up the project of the celebration.  So, said Mr. Hitchcock, whatever chastening or restraining influence the ladies might have on this day was due to Mr. Metcalfe.</p>

                            <p>W. S. Day of the Aurora Register was to have responded to the toast, "Nebraska; She Leads Them All," but he could not be present and the response was made by George L. Burr of the same paper.  He said:</p>
                            <p>In some respects I am unified by nature to make response to the toast proposed, being of an argumentative disposition and accustomed to reach conclusions only by exhaustive and exhausting discussion.  A question with only one side to it and no end at all is a very difficult one for me to handle.  When a boy I remember reflecting on the awful consequences of a supposed encounter between an irresistible force and an immovable body, but they are likely to prove mild in comparison with the result when an interminable talker comes into perihelion with an inexhaustible subject.</p>
                            <p>That Nebraska leads them all is a self-evident proposition.  Who would produce statistics to demonstrate that the sun shines or the wind blows.  (Especially would it resemble the carrying of coals to Newcastle to attempt to prove by figures or diagrams that the wind blows in Nebraska.)  The people of this state have acquired a reputation of being a little extravagant and given to exaggeration when speaking of its advantages.  I shall, therefore, weigh well my words and be ultra conservative in every statement made, preferring only the modest claim that Nebraska has the richest soil, the purest air, the best water and as manly men and womanly women as can be found on this earth.</p>
                            <p>One has but to breathe the lifeless air of the lower altitudes: note the stunted products of the red and yellow putty called farm land throughout the east and south; attempt to swallow the lukewarm solutions of clay which hundreds of thousands of good people must use as a beverage, to be keenly sensible of some of the every day, yet priceless, blessings in which Nebraska leads them all.  No person who has sweltered through the long night and until 4 o'clock in the morning for a refreshing breath, or who has felt a touch of malaria in his system, would be willing to exchange our climate for all the big red apples of the universe.</p>

                            <p>I am of the west, western.  I have lived here for more than a quarter century and have passed <choice><sic>form</sic><corr>from</corr></choice> boyhood to manhood in a homestead country.  I can remember breaking sod day after day when the highest object in sight was the ears of my taller horse.  I have witnessed the development of our state from a barren, treeless plain to one of the most fertile and beautiful countries ever sung by poets or prosed over by historians.  The labor of one generation of men has effected this transformation, and next to the welfare of my family I have no stronger wish than to see Nebraska owned, free and clear of <choice><sic>incumbrance</sic><corr>encumbrance</corr></choice>, by the people who have sacrificed so much to make it what <choice><sic>is it</sic><corr>it is</corr></choice>.</p>

                                <l>Long ago in the days of "hoppers,"</l>
                                <l>When real estate agents dealt in whoppers.</l>
                                <l>House of sod with roof poles limber;</l>
                                <l>Buffalo grass and cottonwood timber;</l>
                                <l>People poor&#8212;with hearts of pity;</l>
                                <l>Each incipient town a city;</l>

                            </lg>
                            <p>The settlers of those days may have had to live largely on "bread and with it," but no heroes have greater claims on the world's history than the pioneers of Nebraska.  Earnest and indomitable, hard-working and self-denying, they labored to make homes for their children, and they bore with fortitude&#8212;nay unexampled good humor&#8212;all the misfortunes of frontier life.</p>
                            <p>One day in August a forlorn, disheartened-looking team, drawing a rickety wagon, passed through our "city," bearing a western family back east for a winter's visit to "the wife's folks."  As they drove by a crowd of young fellows gathered in front of the harness shop and it became apparent from the looks and gestures of the spectators that they were poking fun at his rig.  Quick as a flash the homesteader gave to his willing team the signal to stop and leveling his long forefinger at the boys, shouted earnestly:  "Look here, strangers, I ain't so darned poor as you think I am.  One of these horses isn't mine."</p>
                            <p>Such citizenship is one of the resources of Nebraska.  The best harvest of which any land can boast is brave and worthy men and women.  The best heritage we can leave our children is an ancestry that merits their emulation.  These things have left their impress upon Nebraska.  Springing from such stock, surrounded by such environments, who wonders that everything here is done on a large scale.  That our stalk fields are so extensive that we are spoken of as the "fodder land;" that we could furnish a necklace of corn cribs to encircle almost any territory desired; that our commerce, both internal and external, exceeds that of any other commonwealth of equal age, and that in the late Spanish skirmish we made a record that proves us worthy sons of the brave sires who in the days of rebellion from a population of 30,000&#8212;possibly 7,500 families&#8212;sent 3,307 officers and men to fight for freedom.</p>
                            <p>To conclude, Nebraska is noted for her peculiarities, her possibilities and her productions.  The fame of our pure air, Poland China pigs and pop-pop-popular government has gone abroad in the land.  Who has not heard of our bright women, brainy men, and Bry-an.  Where can you find the equal of our cattle, corn or country newspapers?  Our crops are world beaters; our exposition beats the World's fair; and our World-Herald can't be beat.</p>
                            <p>The day has come when we can attune our voices not only to the melody of pioneer days.</p>

                            <head type="sub">"THE COUNTRY YOKEL."</head>
                            <p>"The Country Yokel" was the toast assigned to George Wells of the Central City Democrat.  He could not be present, but his response was read by G. W. Hurlbut of the Aurora Sun.  It was as follows:</p>
                            <p>Some city editors and a few other ignorant people place a very small valuation on us country yokels, but I am happy to know that our present entertainers are not of the number of these deluded people.  The former consider us a lot of burden-bearers, makers of brick without straw, mere registers of other men's opinions, hardly worthy of the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table.  But we who belong to the country yokels proper have a very different opinion of ourselves.  We do not go to the city or magazine press for inspiration.  It comes to us direct from the original source of wisdom and honesty.</p>
                            <p>We make public opinion.  We elect all the officers of this country from president down.  If you don't believe this, make a nomination for congress in a country district anywhere and turn the entire district press against him and you will find he won't have votes enough to make a respectable procession at a pauper's funeral.  We are a modest set of fellows, but we know our own power, although we use it sparingly.  We are as a class honest, although perhaps it is because we have to be.  City papers can sell their politics and it doesn't cause a ripple on the passing current of public opinion.</p>
                            <p>But let an insignificant little country editor show the least evidence of purchase or sale in a political campaign and the whole pack turn and rend him.  One side despises him for his venality, and the other curses him for his duplicity.  Judas would never have betrayed his master nor Peter denied his Lord if Jesus had selected his original disciples from the ranks of the country editors of Sweet Galilee or along the banks of the Jordan or Platte.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ALL GOOD FELLOWS.</head>
                            <p>The country yokels are the most liberal people in the world.  They live in poor houses, they wear cheap clothing, but they give away fortunes with reckless abandon.  Their free advertising for charitable purposes exceeds their paid advertising, and nobody ever stops to thank them.  A candidate for congress throws a silver dollar into the passing contribution box of the Church of the Hobgoblins, and the whole congregation glorifies him.  The country editor makes an annual contribution of $100 in advertising to the same church, and the chances are the minister will use him as a frightful example of original sin.</p>
                            <p>It is fortunate that we are neither envious nor jealous, or we would be crushed with ingratitude and be sorrowful from neglect.  We do all the work of the campaign up to the time of the nomination, and then, like the priest and the Levite, they pass us by on the other side.  We send John Smith to congress and the Hon. John Smith sends us a patent office report.  We would rather have $5 in depreciated silver, but he always forgets that.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, we country yokels are as God made us&#8212;generous, good-natured and forgiving, and still kind, hoping much, asking nothing, always burying the past, always glorifying the future, helping everybody without return, praising the good, denouncing the evil, making the people better, the churches more charit-<unclear reason="torn"/>pay for a lifetime of self-denying work until the day of promise that will come to us in the sweet by and by.</p>

                            <p>"The Late Unpleasantness" was the theme of W. J. Waite of the Exeter Enterprise.  Said he:</p>
                            <p>Only a few months ago the sentiment "Our Late Unpleasantness," would have carried a different meaning from that which it does today.  It would have called to memory some of the darkest pages of American history and reminded us of a war between brethren of the same race&#8212;children of a common heritage.  It would have called to mind a long period following that war during which smothered hatred, prejudice and misunderstanding poisoned the fountains of our political life.</p>
                            <p>Today our late unpleasantness can be referred to from every section of a wholly united country with pride, unmixed with any feelings of humiliation.  The story of our latest unpleasantness has already become history familiar to us all.  The starry flag of American liberty has been carried in foreign lands and on foreign seas&#8212;not by northerners or southerners, easterners or westerners&#8212;but by American heroism, whether nurtured on the rocky hillsides of New England, under the magnolias of the sunny south, or on the waving grain fields of our own breezy west.  All American resounds with the heroic deeds of Americans and in the light of recent history the last vestige of sectional hatred or distrust has vanished from our land.  A great statesman has said that "this alone is worth more than the cost of the war in blood and treasure."</p>

                            <p>But there are other beneficial results to be considered.  The territory added to our national domain will bring under the beneficent rule of our advanced, if not perfect, civilization millions who were before still governed by the theories and conditions of the dark ages.  For them the light of the twentieth century will illumine the gloom of the fourteenth.  While the problems of the government of these newly acquired possessions may raise serious questions for future consideration the immediate benefits to the people of our new possessions cannot be questioned.</p>
                            <p>There is another lesson which may be drawn from this war.  Side by side with the starry banner has floated that flag, dear not only to Americans, but to humanitarians of all lands&#8212;the Red Cross.  No braver deeds have been done by the men behind the guns than by these messengers of "Peace on earth; good will to men," who have braved the fevered south-land and the perils of land and sea on their errands of mercy.  The devoted services of these people, knowing no race but humanity and no religion but brotherhood, has</p>

All must acknowledge its educating influence upon the thousands who daily come to view its exhibits of nature's bounty and man's inventive genius and energy.</p>

                            <p>The great educational factor is man's environment, his communication with people and things, and his contact, through the avenues of history and literature, with those master minds whose deeds have been the stimulus to the world's progress.</p>
                            <p>The lethargy of the dark ages was aroused by the crusades.  The invention of letters and the work of the reformation kindled anew the flame which has been the enlightenment of the civilized world.  We of today see the grand total results in the progress of the nineteenth century as exemplified by all that man's creative faculties have accomplished and the revelations of nature's store houses, made through his instrumentality.</p>
                            <p>As the human mind has been fed and its ideas developed and broadened we find the tendency to still further achievements stimulated and nourished by social and business gatherings and by exhibitions of art, science and agriculture.  These have been seen on our own continent by the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1853, our Centennial celebration of 1876, the great World's fair of 1893, and last but in no wise least, our own western enterprise, the Trans-Mississippi of 1898.</p>

                            <head type="sub">VALUE OF EXPOSITIONS.</head>
                            <p>What benefits are these expositions?  What do they accomplish?  This:  They bring together all the people of different vocations and of different sections of the country.  These people see and hear, they examine and study and their minds develop and grow by what they have fed upon.  The individual will travel hereafter in a broader road of intellectuality.  He has been educated by what he has seen and his children and his children's children will receive the benefits of his visit to the exposition.  Every person who comes here returns with quickened impulses and a wider range of mental activity.  His former environments have been outgrown and henceforth he will live in a greater sphere of usefulness to himself and his fellow men.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">OTHER FACTORS IN IT.</head>
                            <p>But the splendid exhibits are not the only educational factors of the Trans-Mississippi.  The various conventions and gatherings daily held wield a progressive influence whose value cannot be calculated.  I heard a professional man say this week that dollars could not buy, could it be sold, the benefit he had received from attending a convention of his calling recently held in this city.  If all this be true of the benefits derived by the individual how much might be said of that greater influence which the exposition shall exert between the north and the south and the east and the west, whose productions are gathered here to be seen and admired.  My limited time will not permit me to even touch upon the magnitude of that influence, hence I close this brief address with the assertion:  No one can afford to miss the exposition.  It is a positive sin to stay away and no person can give<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The memory of the Trans-Mississippi exposition will ever remain an enduring monument to western energy and civilization and of the minds which conceived and carried the project to practical results.</p>
                            <p>The program closed with an address by Edgar Howard of the Papillion Times on "The Country Press&#8212;Its Might and Its Mercy."  Before entering on his subject he tendered the thanks, as its president, of the Nebraska Editorial association and those who, he said, ought to be its members, for the courtesies of the day.  On his subject proper he said:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROUD OF THE TITLE.</head>
                            <p>Were all the writings of all the great molders of thought on the metropolitan press to be taken as true, were all their poisoned shafts of ridicule to reach the yokel breast, I might well decline the task of attempting any defense of, any eulogium upon, the "country" press.  But with high confidence in the personal integrity of the individual members of my profession, and with profound respect for the profession as such, I shrink not, but rather run gladly to the task.  For myself alone I am proud to be numbered as an humble part of the "country" press, accepting as a title of dignity an adjective vulgar and degrading to some eyes and ears.</p>
                            <p>There is, ever has been, ever must be, a plain line of demarcation between the metropolitan and the country press, just such as exists between the country doctor and the city surgeon; between the village pastor and the city doctor of divinity.  Each has his sphere, and a good lesson each has learned if he has taught himself to be content within that sphere.  And shall we admit that one is a greater factor than the other for humanity's good or ill?  I cannot speak for the brethren of the cloth, nor for those of the scalpel, but, speaking for the country yokel only, I cannot grant it so.</p>
                            <p>The metropolitan editor bears only the burden of hewing true to his own paper's line of policy, but too often it is true that the country brother must make or mar, in addition to his own, a policy for the entire community in which he reigns.  I have often been overwhelmed with a sense of my responsibility in my capacity as a country editor.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HIS POWER.</head>
                            <p>Long ago a good angel put it into the hearts of men and women to look with suspicion upon the metropolitan press, and to hang a halo of sanctity about the published words of the country editor.  Perhaps the angel overstepped his authority when he did it, but that was his business.  And, since the yokel had no hand in the job, it is one sin which even a metropolitan editor may not safely charge against him.</p>
                            <p>But the evil, if evil it be, has been done, and in consequence to every country editor has been given a mighty sweep of power, far-reaching, unbounded.  With a single stroke of his pen he has been known to raise up a congressman and cast down a constable; to make a bishop send a favorite preacher back to his town for another year against the protest of all the congregation.  With prescient pen he has invaded the future and designed for high estate the first-born son of Tom Jones, the village dog catcher.  By the might of his magic he has removed the ghostly freckles from the face of the homeliest girl in town, and by one short paragraph has transformed her into the sweetest sweet girl graduate that ever won bouquets on any stage.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">AND OF HIS MERCY.</head>
                            <p>And what of his mercy?  I have said that the country editor's might is unbounded.  His mercy is unboundable.  A wise man has said that charity covers a multitude of sins.  There were no country editors on the earth when the wise man said that.  I concluded that charity has covered her multitude of sins, but I declare to you that the mantle of the bucolic editor's mercy has covered thousands of multitudes.  I have known his mercy to make "youthful indiscretion" out of the most revolting debauch indulged by sons of prominent families in his town, and I have known him to clothe a contest for jack-pots in the Christian garb of progressive euchre.  In countless ways he lets his mercy shine upon the path of life, but never more effulgent than when following that unalterable professional decree, too little known in metropolitan haunts&#8212;a decree which stays his pen, no matter what the cost, no matter how great the "scoop" achieved by an unprofessional contemporary, this side the line, once clothed in type, would blot and blur a woman's name.</p>
                            <p>I might make you weary and might make you weep with recital of his deeds of mercy in his deals with men, but let one instance here suffice:  Once upon a time, in a fair and beautiful land, the people by common consent agreed to assemble in the fairest city of that land the choicest products of the hand of man and mother earth, and then bid all the world a hearty welcome to the grand display.  The plan, successfully accouched, was borne on wings of love and loyalty to all the world by that true herald of humanity's king&#8212;the country editor.  At last the proud day arrived when the magnificent whole was ready for inspection.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HIS MAGNANIMITY.</head>
                            <p>With heart aglow in prospect of the treat in store, the country editor journeyed from far and near to gaze upon and praise the work his hand had builded.  Imagine his state of mind when on his first approach he was informed of an imperial decree which said all manner of other men might walk upright through the gates, but as for the country editor, he must debase himself and like a slimy snake or cringing cur, touch belly to the boards while entering in.  Humiliated, and to escape further humiliation, he returned to his country home.</p>
                            <p>Did he resent the insult by striking dagger to the heart of that grand enterprise which has hand had helped to rear?  Ah, no!  Here it was that the divine side of the country editor's mercy showed to best advantage, and, thanks to that divinity, his pen was made to paint still brighter pictures of the <choice><sic>granduer</sic><corr>grandeur</corr></choice> and the glory of the greatest exposition that ever welcomed a fakir or robbed a country yokel.  And the increasing gate receipts <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>A large proportion of the visiting editors assembled at the west end of the lagoon about 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon to witness the daily exhibition of the life-saving service.  The exhibition was carried out along the usual lines, and passed off without a hitch.  The overturning of the lifeboat was varied slightly by holding the big boat stationary, with the bottom upward, for several moments, and the spectators became rather anxious regarding the <choice><sic>saftey</sic><corr>safety</corr></choice> of the men underneath.  At the next revolution of the boat one of the men climbed on top as the bottom turned up, and as it righted he seemed to disappear in the water, and several of the spectators insisted that the man had gone down.  But the knowing ones noticed that he simply took his place with the crew as the boat righted.  The editors were interested observers of the entire proceeding, and enjoyed it hugely.</p>

                            <p>The bureau of entertainment held a reception in its parlors in the gallery of the Mines building for the ladies of the editorial party at 5 o'clock.  The handsome room were made even more attractive by a liberal supply of potted plants, and the refreshing north wind which came through the open windows made the place the most delightful spot on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>A committee of the bureau was on hand to assist in entertaining the guests and the spirit of cordiality displayed made the visitors feel entirely at home.  The reception committee consisted of Mrs. Clement Chase, the president of bureau of entertainment; Mrs. W. A. Redick, secretary of the bureau; Mesdames G. W. Wattles, F. P. Kirkendall, G. M. Hitchcock, George F. Bidwell, Thomas Kilpatrick, T. M. Orr, John S. Brady, Frank Copeltzer, W. F. Allen, Paul Charlton, Henry Winston, W. N. Babcock and Miss Crounse.</p>
                            <p>As the guests arrived they were met by Mr. G. M. Hitchcock and presented to the ladies of the reception committee.  They were most hospitably entertained by the members of the reception committee and their expressions of enjoyment were frequent and hearty.  A delicious ice was served to each guest and the refreshing effect of this, together with the delightful breeze which came in the north windows, made the temptation to rest after the warm tramp about the grounds <choice><sic>amost</sic><corr>almost</corr></choice> irresistible.  The guests gave frequent expressions to their enjoyment of the entertainment which had been afforded them on all sides during the day and a large <choice><sic>proportoin</sic><corr>proportion</corr></choice> of them expressed a determination to remain in the city another day in order to more closely inspect the <choice><sic>expostiion</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice>.</p>

The Nebraska editors, their wives, sweethearts and sisters will also remember that day.  And the World-Herald will also have many tender recollections of the occasion.  It was a great day and while it resulted in great pleasure to the Nebraska editors and their ladies, it will result in great benefit to the exposition itself.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>World-Herald day has gone, but its record stands written in a prominent place in current exposition history.  It stands up to date as the third biggest day in the history of the exposition, exceeded only by the Fourth of July and the opening day.  And it was less than 5,000 behind opening day in point of attendance.</p>
                            <p>The total admissions yesterday were 23,603, and the receipts at the gate were $7,110.  Of this amount over $5,200 was taken up to 3 o'clock, showing a day attendance that will compare favorably with any of the so-called "big days" of the exposition, except the two above mentioned.  It was also another indisputable triumph for the 25 cent evening rate, as about 5,000 people paid their way into the grounds at the reduced rate during the evening.</p>
                            <p>The following are the official figures showing the attendance on a few of the other "big days:"  Military day, 20,226; Indian day, 19,648; Flower day, 21,441; Texas day, 21,225.  World-Herald day stepped ahead of them to the extent of from 2,000 to 4,000 in attendance, and from $1,000 to $1,500 in gate receipts, so that not only in prospective results was the occasion a momentous one for the exposition, but in immediate returns it takes a place in the front rank.  On a cold financial basis it will net the exposition about $6,000 above the day's expenses when the receipts from concessions percentages are in.</p>

                            <p>While thousands crowded the various Midway concessions until nearly midnight.  World-Herald day proper went out in a blaze of fireworks that set the sky aflame with an aerial conflagration of red, green, blue, silver and gold.  It was the grandest pyrotechnic display ever seen in the west, and it was a fitting conclusion for the eventful day that had been celebrated.  The A. L. Due Fireworks company did itself proud, completely outclassing its former efforts thus far made during the exposition period.</p>
                            <p>The general program was along the lines heretofore followed, but every feature was amplified, while a number of new ones were added.  The brilliant illumination of the entire north tract in colored fire was followed by the set piece, "Welcome, Country Press."  Then came a flight of 100 two-pound fancy display rockets, after which the entire surface of the lake was set ablaze with fountains, volcanoes and diving porpoises.  Next came six eighteen-inch weeping willow shells, and then a flight of A. L. Due's magnesium rockets with silver effects.</p>
                            <p>A set piece, "World-Herald&#8212;30,000 Daily&#8212;All the News All the Time," in colored fire, was then shown, and the immense crowd showed its good will in enthusiastic applause.  Other set pieces were a jeweled spreading fan with revolving stars, a spiral forty foot wheel, with colored spirals working transversely, and a grand spectacle showing Niagara Falls, 300 feet long, the falls changing to silver, with its stream of falling stars.</p>

                            <p>A feature that was greatly appreciated was one of A. L. Due's sixty-inch shells, which exploded at great height and filled the sky with its 20,000 stars.  The big double shells, exploding twice in the air, and the bicycle rider, pigeons, festoon rockets, etc., which have been seen before, were all reproduced in satisfying number.  The display concluded with a grand triple bombardment, with many new effects, including a flight of 500 rockets and 2,200 candles.  The gorgeous spectacle was one not to be soon forgotten by any of those who witnessed it.</p>
                            <p>The visitors had a hot time on the Midway, where the World-Herald's guests were warmly welcomed at every concession.  A few made the mistake of presenting their passes at the ticket windows instead of at the gates, but the error was soon corrected, and everything went without a hitch.  They were here to see everything the Midway had to offer, and they succeeded far more completely than any other crowd of similar size has ever done.  The concessionaires were as anxious for them to see as they were themselves, and <unclear reason="torn"/>posal.  At many of the concessions special shows were put on solely for the complimentary visitors, and the concessionaires vied with each other in extending courtesies and exerting themselves to make the guests of the day feel doubly welcome.</p>
                            <p>The editors and their wives apparently enjoyed themselves to the very limit, and if they write of their experience as they talked last night the country press will have some interesting tales to relate within the next ten days.</p>
                            <p>H. Landy and George Allen were arrested for trying to crowd their way into the Trilby concession when intoxicated and using indecent language when refused admission.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">WANTED--LOW RATES FROM THE EAST.</hi></head>
                            <p>The financial, artistic and educational success of the Transmississippi Exposition is already achieved.  As an enterprise reflecting the energy, progress and possibilities of the great west it elicits only words of unstinted praise from all who see it and excels even the most sanguine expectations of its most enthusiastic promoters.</p>
                            <p>Yet one of the principal objects for which the great exposition was projected and carried into execution was to present to the people of the east a graphic illustration of what had been accomplished in agriculture, mining, commerce and manufacturing by the states west of the Mississippi and to demonstrate to them that the transmississippi region offers the most attractive field for new settlers and new enterprises and the most profitable place for safe investments.  That the exposition is well calculated to serve this purpose is generally conceded.  That it has already done much in this direction is apparent.  To enable it to exert its full influence for this work of enlightenment the people of the east must, however, in the remaining months of the wonderful show be brought out to see the exposition in greater numbers.</p>
                            <p>There is only one way by which eastern people can be induced to visit Omaha in large bodies.  Attractive reduced railroad rates must be made&#8212;rates low enough to enable people of ordinary means, who may have only small sums to invest, to make the long journey at reasonable expense.  The representative of the Rock Island at Philadelphia is authority for the statement that, with a one-fare rate and corresponding concessions on time limits, he could within a week organize an exposition party of 500 people in that one city as the first of a series of special exposition excursions.  There is no question that the same thing could be done in every large city east of the Alleghanies and proportionate additions secured from all the smaller towns and cities enroute.</p>
                            <p>But it must be remembered that the time is short.  It is not only the members of the Western Passenger association that must be forced to action, though that is all-important, but the great trunk lines east of Chicago must be induced at the earliest possible moment to make a special rate for the Omaha exposition.  Just now the question of reduced railroad rates overshadows all other problems confronting the exposition management and measures should be adopted without delay to have it satisfactorily adjusted.</p>
                        </div2>
                        <div2 type="article">
                            <p>The question of admission rate for Sunday afternoon is still to be settled and the directors may as well come to the conclusion now as later that one of two solutions must be accepted.  It is plain to everyone who has not made up his mind in advance that the full charge of 50 cents for Sunday afternoon admission is unsatisfactory to both exposition and the public.  To give the working people, for whom the gates are kept open Sunday afternoon the full benefit of the exposition, the 25-cent rate must be put in for the remaining Sundays of the exposition period.  If this is not done the gates may as well be closed entirely on Sunday so far as the wage workers are concerned, and other people can attend the exposition any day in the week.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 25.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The following order was issued by the War department today:</p>
                            <p>The large balloon, with generator and gas compressors, now at Tampa, Fla., will be carefully packed and shipped to Omaha, care of Captain Henry C. Ward, in charge of War department exhibit, for temporary use at the exposition, after which the balloon, generator and all equipments will be stored at Fort Omaha.  The commanding officer of that post is directed to furnish storage.</p>
                            <ab>MEIKLEJOHN, <lb/> Acting Secretary of War.</ab>
                            <p>A second war balloon now at Montauk Point will shortly follow as an auxiliary in case of needed repairs to first.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>"The military <choice><sic>ballon</sic><corr>balloon</corr></choice> has now come to be regarded as a very important part of an army's equipment," says an army officer stationed <choice><sic>ata</sic><corr>at</corr></choice> the headquarters of the Department of the Missouri.  "The war with Spain was the first American war in which the <choice><sic>ballon</sic><corr>balloon</corr></choice> was used, and its success in the campaign before Santiago was sufficient to justify the assertion that it will be used more freely by the army of the United States hereafter, and as experiments looking toward improvements and more extended uses are made they will be followed by the keenest interest by all army men.</p>
                            <p>"I said this was the first American war in which the military <choice><sic>ballon</sic><corr>balloon</corr></choice> had played a part.  That is so, but it was not the first instance of its use.  The balloon was used in the Franco-Prussian war for the first time, and although its success was not great at that time, the improvements that have since been made have caused army men to believe that the balloon was a thoroughly practical instrument of warfare.</p>
                            <p>"As shown in the reports of the campaign before Santiago, the use of the balloon was to locate the forts, the garrisons, the block houses and the trenches of the enemy.  In some countries the balloon is bound to be of greater use than others, and I can't imagine a country where the balloon could have a better test than down in Cuba.  In that island, where the <choice><sic>foilage</sic><corr>foliage</corr></choice> is so thick, especially in summer, and the dense thickets and shrubbery, together with the peculiar lay of the land, the ordinary means of taking observations are out of the question.  The balloon was sent up by our army about a mile back of the Spanish garrisons.  Engineers, representatives of the signal service department, went up in the balloon, and at a distance of a mile back from the Spanish strongholds they located with considerable accuracy the position of the enemy and the enemy's guns.  The balloon drew the fire of the Spanish soldiers, but they could not hit it.  It was the fire thus drawn that did some damage among one of the American troops that was marching along a road toward a new position."</p>

                            <p>NEW YORK, Aug. 24.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Manager Rosewater arrived from Washington last night.  On the train he was introduced to Admiral Sampson, to whom he extended an invitation on behalf of the exposition to participate in the Peace Jubilee, as a representative of the navy, on Army and Navy day.  The admiral expressed himself much gratified, pointing out the fact, however, that he was subject to the orders of the Navy department.  If on his return from Havana, where he has just been ordered with the commission, the secretary of the navy would grant him leave or designate him to represent the navy, it would afford him great pleasure to come to Omaha.  While Admiral Sampson may be prevented from participating in the Peace Jubilee function, Manager Rosewater has assurances from the War and Navy departments that a number of distinguished officers would be detached from active service and detailed to make the Army and Navy day function impressive.</p>
                            <p>This afternoon Mr. Rosewater held a conference with Chauncey Depew concerning the celebration of New York day.  Mr. Depew expressed himself anxious to make the day memorable.  He agreed to deliver an address on behalf of the Empire state, but foreshadowed a change of date from October 6 to 8.  This proposed change is, however, to be submitted to the members of the New York commission within a few days.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>"We're whooping it up for the Mondamin Carnival, Sioux City, October 3 to 8, that's what we're whooping for." were the words printed on a large banner and on countless badges, the color of which was like that flag which bit the dust at Manila, Santiago and a few other places recently, but which had no other likeness to that national emblem, and they were carried and worn by the happy representatives of Sioux City, another of the bustling cities of the state which bounds Nebraska on the east.</p>
                            <p>Easy 1,200 of the residents of the corn palace city came to Omaha this morning on a special train of eleven cars, arriving at 11:10, and on two regular trains reaching here during the morning.  They came to celebrate the day at the exposition which had been specially set aside for them, and they came in sufficient number and with such spirit as to make the day an unquestioned success.</p>
                            <p>In the party were the municipal magistrate, the title takers and publicans, the law givers and the scribes, with a retinue of official servants, and a large body of the populace.  The yellow badge, indicating the wealth of the ripened harvest which is to be shown at the coming carnival, was worn by all, and canes cut from mammoth stalks of corn were carried by many, as a lesson that this cereal was a safe staff upon which to lean, not only in Iowa, but also in Nebraska.  They came on a mission of peace if convenient, but one of a war for commercial conquest if necessary, but before they had alighted from the trains they discovered the former was to be adopted by the assaulted city.</p>
                            <p>The spirit of commercial genius, which, it is said, enabled Sioux City to pull itself out of the abyss of hard times and panics and place itself upon the road to business prosperity, is again shown in this visit, for while the visitors came to absorb all the beauties of the Transmississippi Exposition, they also improved the opportunity to boom the carnival which they are to have next month.  Hence the yellow badges with the classical inscription heretofore mentioned and this idea was not lost sight of during the day.</p>

Charles White, representing the Sioux City Journal; Fred M. Colvin of the Sioux City Tribune and James V. Mahoney, commissioner of the Sioux City Commercial association were also in the party.

                            <p>The visitors were received by a delegation of city officials composed of Mayor Moores, Councilman Bechel, Lobeck, Karr, Bingham, Mount and Burmester, Tax Commissioner Sackett, Mayor's Secretary Adams, City Clerk Higbee and Fire Chief Redell.</p>
                            <p>As the train pulled into the station the McCook band gave a welcome with one of its popular airs, after which the reception committee boarded the train and it was pulled out to the grounds, where the excursionists were unloaded at the north gate.  There a procession was formed, headed by the band, which marched to the Auditorium, where the formal reception ceremonies were held.</p>
                            <p>Later the official party left the grounds, and as the entertainment committee did not desire to show any favors to one particular Iowa city which were not shown to others from the same state, the party was taken to the park of the Omaha Brewing association, where it was entertained for an hour in the same manner that the representatives from Des Moines were received.</p>
                            <p>At 2:30 the party was brought down to the city, and given a banquet at the Murray hotel, by the officers of the Omaha' city government, where there was more liquid refreshments in the shape of wine, and where there were more speeches, and mutual felicitations by the representatives of the two cities.</p>
                            <p>The special train will leave on its return trip at 11 o'clock this evening, but as the tickets are good for return on any train the majority of the excursionists will remain over for a day or two to spend more time at the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION CONTRACT WITH THE A. D. T.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Concession Which Gives that Company a Decided Advantage in Transportation Operates to secure an Officer's Dismissal.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Superintendent Owens of the Transportation department of the exposition is no longer superintendent.  Mr. Owens handed in his resignation last Saturday in response to a request from the manager.  The reason given for the request was that the superintendent had by misrepresentation secured special gate privileges for a delivery company.  Mr. Owens' version of the difficulty is as follows:</p>
                            <p>"For some weeks the general manager, exhibitors and concessionaires have been protesting bitterly against the service and exorbitant rates of the American District Telegraph company; these complaints were referred to the express companies, but little or no attention seems to have been given them.  Finally the exhibitors in the Horticulture building informed the Department of Transportation that unless relief was granted inside of one week every fruit exhibit in the building would be closed.  Within twenty-four hours an arrangement was put in operation whereby the exhibitors in the Horticulture building were given satisfactory service at a reduction in transportation rates of at least 33 per cent and with no loss in revenue to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"It appears, however, the superintendent of transportation in this stepped on the toes of one or two of the directors (owners of the American District Telegraph company).  At any rate, President Wattles insisted upon his removal without a hearing and demanded the exclusion from the grounds of wagons in which he is charged to have an interest.</p>
                            <p>"The executive committee decided months ago that the exposition would have nothing to do with the delivery of express goods in the grounds nor would it assume any responsibility therefor, but that the express companies would be allowed to make deliveries under certain restrictions and at certain rates of charges.  The company which Mr. Wattles now attempts to exclude from the grounds is the first one to apply for permission to make delivery of express matter under the action of the executive committee, the first to be granted that permission by <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> executive committee and it purchased in regular form the first season wagon ticket ever issued by the exposition for that purpose.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Concerning the Contract.</head>
                            <p>"The executive committee entered into a contract with the American District Telegraph company on January 14, 1898, granting the said American District Telegraph company the concession, privilege or right to maintain on the exposition grounds and between the grounds and the city of Omaha a messenger and parcel delivery service for the transmission of messages and such personal effects as under the rules of said exposition may be admitted to the grounds through its <unclear reason="torn"/> transmitted by hand.  This privilege not to extend to any article of merchandise or supply for any exhibitor or concessionaire.  The rates for service, both within the grounds and between the grounds and the city of Omaha, to be established by mutual consent.</p>
                            <p>"As compensation for the rights and privileges granted the American District Telegraph company agrees to pay the exposition 25 per cent of the daily gross receipts from all sources arising from the operation of the <choice><sic>concesssion</sic><corr>concession</corr></choice> during the continuance of said exposition.  Said American District Telegraph company agrees to keep full and true accounts of receipts from all sources and that said accounts shall be open to inspection by the executive committee of the exposition, its officers and agents at any time that it will make settlements and payments of percentages under the contract each day for the previous day's business, or as often and at such time or times as shall be designated by the exposition; and that the manner of ascertaining the amount of the gross receipts shall be such as the exposition shall approve or prescribe; and that the exposition shall have power to appoint cashiers, or require the use of cash registers, to receive and account for the gross receipts whenever in its judgment it may be deemed necessary, the cost of such cashiers or cash registers to be paid by the American District Telegraph company."</p>
                            <p>"Up to 12 o'clock, noon, August 22, not 1 cent had been credited on the books of the exposition on account of this concession, nor on any other account.  Still, neither the president not any of the directors have taken any action to protect the exposition under this violated contract."</p>

                            <p>Two of the biggest excursions that have yet been landed at the exposition gates came in this morning to help celebrate Sioux City day.  The aggregate number of people brought in surpassed even the expectations of the exposition officials, and with a 25-cent admission after 6 o'clock tonight they are anticipating an even bigger day than yesterday.</p>
                            <p>The first party on the grounds was brought in by the Burlington special from Lincoln and it was a whale.  The train consisted of fifteen coaches and they were jammed full of children.  There were upward of 1,000 of them in the party, and when they were marshaled into the grounds they suggested the query whether there were any more of the same size left in Lincoln.  Their train arrived at the Burlington depot just before 9 o'clock and the children were at once taken to the grounds in special motor trains.  As they had been provided with tickets on the trains, there was little delay in getting them inside, and fifteen minutes later they were scattered from the Indian camp to the Arch of States.  As their train does not leave on the return trip until 9:30 this evening, they will have a full day on the grounds and be able to see the illuminations and hear most of the evening concert.  They will be mobilized at the north gate at 8:45 and special motors will be ready to take them to the depot.  The Rock Island had a number of extra cars attached to its regular morning train and swelled the children's crowd to about 1,500.</p>
                            <p>The Sioux City crowd was another big factor in the attendance.  The management had expected 1,000 people from that city and that figure was slightly exceeded.  A special train of eleven coaches brought the bulk of the crowd, but the regular trains were also heavily loaded.  The special delivered it burden at the Boyd street entrance and the party was at once conducted to the Audi-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The excursionists arrived at the Auditorium at noon, headed by the McCook band and conducted by General Manager Clarkson and Mayor Moores, and after a selection by the band Mayor Moores briefly welcomed the visitors to the exposition city.  He referred to the associations that have resulted from previous municipal visits and declared that they have been productive of no little profit to all interested.  He emphasized the fact that Iowa is fully as deeply concerned in the success of the exposition as Nebraska.  All the visitors who come from the east must pass through the fertile prairies of Iowa.  They form their opinion of the transmississippi country not only from the exposition, but from their views of the magnificent agricultural country through which they must ride to reach it.  He presented the usual golden keys emblematic of the liberty of the city and invited the visitors to take full advantage of the privileges thus afforded.</p>
                            <p>Mayor J. H. Quick of Sioux City replied in a happy manner to the felicitations extended by the mayor of Omaha.  He declared that the two cities have much in common.  When Omaha is full of people, Sioux City is also prosperous.  When fortune frowned on Omaha, then are the skies of Sioux City overcast.  This magnificent exposition, which meant so much to Omaha, would be a potent force in building up its sister city.  He expressed the most hearty appreciation of the hospitable welcome that they had received and gave way to General Manager Clarkson, who tendered the greeting of the exposition management.  He complimented the visitors on the valuable co-operation of their state in the creation of the exposition and particularly emphasised the cosmopolitan and international character of the show.  Adverse circumstances offered many opportunities for failure, but in spite of all the exposition had opened its gates without issuing a mortgage or a bond and in twenty days more it would not owe a dollar in the world.  He briefly sketched some of the prospective features of the Peace Jubilee and other notable events that will occur during the next two months and declared that there would be an attendance that would amaze the world.</p>
                            <p>City Attorney F. E. Gill of Sioux City briefly responded to Major Clarkson's greeting and the crowd was dismissed with an invitation to make itself at home.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mr. Hitchcock of World-Herald Has a Number of Guests at the Grounds.</head>
                            <p>Yesterday the World-Herald celebrated its thirteenth anniversary at the exposition with about 100 Nebraska editors, who came here on invitation of the paper.  The visitors together with their wives and best girls, congregated at the Millard hotel, and just before noon boarded a special train of trolley cars and journeyed to the grounds, entering the gates at the rear of the Georgia building.  There the party formed on the Plaza, and, headed by a band, marched to Markel's.  After the cigars had been passed to the male members of the party and candy to the women and children, the oratorical portion of the program was taken up, G. M. Hitchcock presiding.  He welcomed the newspaper people, informing them that the occasion was for the purpose of properly observing the thirteenth anniversary of his paper.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles welcomed the visitors to the city.  He said that this was the thirty-sixth address of welcome delivered since the opening of the great show, and at no time had he felt so proud of his audience as now.  The country press has had much to do with the work of building the Exposition, and to the editors he wanted to extend a hearty assurance of appreciation of their labors.  He assured them that during the second week in October there will be a fitting climax in the holding of the Peace Jubilee.  He invited the editors to attend and informed them that they will be welcome at the Exposition at all times and under all conditions of circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Other addresses were delivered by Captain James, Dr. George L. Miller, George L. burr, W. J. Waite, W. T. Howard and Edgar Howard.</p>
                            <p>After the speaking all of the editors and their wives were provided with tickets of admission to the Midway attractions and the visitors were at liberty to go where they pleased.  During the afternoon they visited the main buildings,the Midway and the exhibition of the Life Saving crew.</p>
                            <p>During the afternoon the ladies of the party were tendered a reception in the rooms of the woman's entertainment committee in the Mining building, those receiving being Mesdames G. W. Wattles, W. N. Babcock F. P. Kirkendall, T. M. Orr, C. Chase, G. F. Bidwell, J. F. Brady, G. M. Hitchcock, Thomas Kilpatrick, Frank Colpetzer, W. F.

                            <head type="sub">Manager Rosewater Also Secures an Addition to the Indian Congress.</head>
                            <p>The following article from the Washington Post gives the details of some of the work accomplished for the exposition by Manager Rosewater of the Publicity department on his present trip east:</p>
                            <p>Mr. Edward Rosewater, one of the managers of the Transmississippi Exposition and editor of The Omaha Bee, who has been in this city in the interest of that enterprise, as already stated in the Post, has secured a carload of Spanish war relics, which will be sent west at once for exhibition.  This carload will be made up of brass cannon, Mauser rifles, the first Spanish flag captured in Cuba and many other articles of a like nature.  Mr. Rosewater hopes also to obtain permission for the exhibition of the captive balloon that was used at Santiago.</p>
                            <p>Another errand for the exposition, which Mr. Rosewater come on, is to secure more Indians for the congress at Omaha and, in compliance with his request, Mr. James Mooney of the Bureau of Ethnology will start today for the Navajoe and Kiowa reservations in an endeavor to bring 150 more representatives of those tribes, ponies and all, to Omaha.  Mr. Rosewater has asked the War department to allow Geronimo, the famous Apache chief, and his band to be transported to Omaha.  He was surprised to find that the officials of the War department did not know that the chief was still a prisoner of the United States.  He has been held by the army as a prisoner for thirteen years at Fort Sill.</p>
                            <p>As already announced in the Sunday Post, Mr. Rosewater, accompanied by Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn, had a conference with President McKinley on Saturday afternoon, the purpose of which was an informal invitation to the president to visit the exposition in case he takes a vacation.  The president signified his willingness to make the tour, emphasizing the point by stating that a president who has closed a successful war could well afford to exhibit his appreciation of the arts of peace by a personal visit to the great industrial exposition, entered upon and carried out in the face of war and in spite of very formidable obstacles.</p>

                            <p>Prof. Atwater, in charge of the Texas exhibit, has received a collection of photographs taken at different parts in the state and sent to him.  They show farm scenes, specimens of fruit, herds of live stock, views of forests, streets in cities and rural homes.  The professor finds it impossible to move the whole of Texas to the exposition, so he has secured 100 large pictures to show some of the things that he could not bring along.</p>

                            <p>On the evening of Friday, September 2, a unique entertainment will be given on the exposition grounds under the auspices of the exposition authorities and the Ladies' Bureau of Entertainment.  It will be a carnival such as have become famous in Rome and Venice, and will consist of crowds of maskers, dressed in fancy costumes and in dominoes, and will be open generally to the public, who are cordially invited to take part in it and to make it the greatest spectacle that has yet been held in connection with the exposition.  It will take place on the broad walks surrounding the lagoon, and seats for spectators will be provided back of the pavement.  Bands will be stationed at various places around the lagoon, which will furnish music for the dancing and antics of this masquerade.  The Auditorium has been set aside on that night as a dressing room and general rendezvous for the hundreds of people who will participate.  The carnival will open with a grand parade of all the maskers around the lagoon, after which the maskers will dance and engage in a battle of confetti and flowers, booths for the sale of which will be placed at frequent intervals around the lagoon.  The gondolas and launches will be especially decorated, there will be special illuminations and water fireworks and altogether it will be the most brilliant spectacle ever seen in Omaha.  Very general interest is already excited over it and from the inquiries and promises of co-operation there is no doubt but that the citizens and visitors generally mean to unite to make the number participating something far beyond the most sanguine anticipations of the management.  All persons are cordially invited to take part.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Conclusion of War Brightens the Prospects of the Exposition.</head>
                            <l>Cleveland Leader.</l>
                            <p>With the end of the war the managers of the Omaha exposition see a change to push the great and beneficent enterprise in which that city and the state of Nebraska have invested much.  They understand that as long as the interest and attention of the readers of newspapers were centered upon the conflict with Spain it was impossible to obtain from the press the free advertising which any great industrial exposition needs and merits.  Now the way is open for at least some degree of favors showered upon other like displays of the progress of the times and the resources and achievements of the American people.  Therefore the men who have carried the Omaha enterprise forward, in the face of great obstacles and manifold discouragements, hope to reap, in the later weeks of the exposition, a partial reward for their faith and labors, and so offset, in part at least, the losses and disappointments due directly to the war.</p>
                            <p>Every American ought to wish the Omaha exposition the fullest success.  It should have a liberal share of the favor bestowed upon the big exhibitions of the arts and industries and resources of the country which have lately been made at Atlanta and Nashville.  The enterprise, courage and energy displayed in the development and maintenance of the Transmississippi Exposition are worthy of all praise.  It has been held up to the lofty plans of its projectors, and the display of the gains of civilization, in our country and times, is undoubtedly one of the best ever made.  Probably it has never been equaled, except in the Columbian exposition at Chicago.</p>
                            <p>The pity is that comparatively few of those who might have visited the exposition with pleasure and profit have done so.  Its attractions have not been forced upon the attention of the American people as the best points of other exposition have been, and the war has been the sole cause of the neglect.  Now the Nebraskans, who have done their part so well, are trying to make the change that peace can fairly be expected to bring as complete and far-reaching as possible.  They are hopeful of a visit from the president, and they are pushing in many ways the work of arousing public interest.</p>
                            <p>They deserve the utmost success.  It cannot be too wide and great for the good of the nation.</p>

                            <dateline>WORLD-HERALD: OMAHA <lb/> FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 1898.</dateline>
                            <head type="sub">THE LESSONS OF THE DAY.</head>
                            <p>There are several lessons to be learned from the success of "World-Herald Day" at the exposition.  And these lessons should be grasped by the public generally and the exposition management in particular.</p>
                            <p>"World-Herald Day" saw the largest crowd that has gathered at the exposition save on the opening day and July 4.  The figures are as follows:</p>
                            <p>Opening day, 39,043; July 4, 44,200; World-Herald day, 23,000.</p>
                            <p>There have been many special days at the exposition, but the total admissions on "World-Herald Day" were larger than on any of these special days with the sole exception of "Opening Day" and July 4.  The lesson to be learned from this is the value of the World-Herald as an advertising medium, for the World-Herald undertook the task of advertising this special day.  The other lesson, and the one which should be learned by the exposition managers, is the value of the help that can be extended to the exposition by the country press.  Country newspapers in Nebraska were invited to be represented at the exposition as the guest of the World-Herald, and the country press reciprocated by advertising World-Herald day as no other special day has been advertised until the most liberal policy toward the country press is adopted.  One can scarcely comprehend the amount of advertising this special day would have secured had the World-Herald been in position to extend the invitation to the publishers of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota and Wyoming.  The advertising that the exposition has secured through the kindness of the country press toward the World-Herald is the most valuable the exposition has received.  The advertising was done in the section from which the exposition, under the prevailing circumstances, must receive the larger share of its patronage.  Prohibitive railroad rates render useless any efforts to induce people from a great distance to see the exposition, and the receipts must be from the people living within a radius of 300 miles of Omaha.  Only a small portion of this section was included in the World-Herald's invitation, but the effect of the free will advertising of the Nebraska country press through its kindly feeling for the World-Herald is seen in the increased attendance and felt in the treasury of the exposition in shape of enlarged gate receipts.  If the exposition management is wise it will heed the lesson taught by "World-Herald Day."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Another big day at the exposition is to be scored to the credit of Sioux City and the children.  Yesterday's total attendance was 24,223, which was 620 more than on the previous day, although the gate receipts were $6,895.15, or $215 less than on Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>The receipts up to 3 o'clock were $500 less than on Wednesday, but the evening attendance at the 25-cent rate was 5,744, or more than 1,000 greater than on Wednesday.  So far as the evening rate was concerned, two consecutive evenings at the reduced rate netted each over 4,000 admissions more than the average 50-cent evenings for the past ten days, and the few directors who were to be seen after the result was announced last night said they were personally in favor of extending the reduced rate to at least two nights each week.</p>
                            <p>The members of the board of directors may not be able at today's meeting to definitely arrange further details for the peace jubilee, as Mr. Rosewater's special correspondence from Washington and on board train en route to New York indicates that President McKinley has not yet promised him three times that he would come.  It seems that when the president told him, just as he had previously told Senator Thurston, that he would like to attend the exposition and would try to be here the second week in October, Mr. Rosewater conceived the idea that the president was "jollying" him.  He was inclined to think that perhaps the president had laid his size up against him and had only made half a promise, so he went back the next day and assured the chief executive that it was no "josh" that he had been <choice><sic>givinghim</sic><corr>giving him</corr></choice>.  He intimated to Mr. McKinley that he frequently repeated his own assertions several times as it helped him to believe them himself, and he wanted to know whether or not the president had really meant what he said on the previous day.  The president expressed some surprise at the implied doubt as to his veracity, but Mr. Rosewater soon made him feel completely at home by telling him that he knew just how he felt, as his own word had been seriously questioned on more than one occasion, but he never thought anything of it.</p>
                            <p>The president at once realized that if a man in Mr. <choice><sic>Rosewater' sposition</sic><corr>Rosewater's position</corr></choice> could overlook a thing like that, he could certainly afford to do the same, and he proceeded to reiterate to his visitor his intention of coming out to see the exposition.  He said that ever since he first heard that Mr. Rosewater had been fenced in and was to be publicly exhibited this season, he had been consumed with a desire to be present and do honor to the occasion, but he asked as a special favor that Mr. Rosewater would wear his everyday clothes and not put on any extra frills to receive him.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Rosewater told the president that would be all right, but said that he was so much sought after by other great men that he could not be expected to give all his time to one, and he wanted the president to understand that if time hung heavy on his hands in Omaha in October
                            
                            <pb n="106" xml:id="TMISB06-106"/>
                            
                            it would not be due to any desire on Mr. Rosewater's part to slight him, and he did not want the president to feel sore about it.</p>
                            <p>The president said he wouldn't, and Mr. Rosewater started for New York with a lighter heart, as soon as he had dispatched an urgent wire to Omaha asking the exposition officials to honor a draft, as the expenses of securing the president's consent had been unexpectedly heavy.</p>
                            <p>The only thing about the situation that annoys the exposition officials is that Mr. Rosewater did not go back the third time and get another promise, but it is thought that possibly he will come back that way and then make up for the oversight.  Some of the directors express doubt as to what the situation really is, feeling that the president might have been moved to promise Mr. Rosewater anything in order to get rid of him, as is frequently done by members of the exposition board, but others say that they don't do that way in high official circles, and they pin their faith to the president's assurances to Senator Thurston, on which the time for the peace jubilee was fixed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">RESIGNATION OF OWENS.</head>
                            <p>The resignation of Superintendent John O. Owens of the transportation department is due to the express delivery regulations inside the grounds.  These regulations have caused a continuous kick since the opening day.  There is hardly a concessionaire or exhibitor who has not lodged from one to a dozen complaints on this score, but the fruit exhibitors with their perishable goods were the loudest protestors, and it was through them that the clash came.  Regarding the situation, Mr. Owens says:</p>
                            <p>"For some weeks the general manager, exhibitors and concessionaires have been protesting bitterly against the service and exorbitant rates of the American District Telegraph company, but little or no attention seems to have been given them.  Finally the exhibitors in the Horticulture building informed the department of transportation that unless relief was granted inside of one week every fruit exhibit in the building would be closed.  Within twenty-four hours an arrangement was put in operation whereby the exhibitors in the Horticulture building were given absolutely satisfactory service, at a reduction in transportation rates of at least 33 per cent and with no loss in revenue to the exposition.  It appears, however, the superintendent of transportation stepped on the toes of one or two of the directors (owners of the American District Telegraph), and very much provoked the president; at any rate, Mr. Wattles insisted upon his removal without a hearing and demanded the exclusion from the grounds of wagons in which he is charged to have an interest.</p>
                            <p>"Where does the president come in on this proposition?  The executive committee decided months ago that the exposition would have nothing to do with the delivery of express goods in the grounds, nor would it assume any responsibility therefor, but that the express companies would be allowed to make deliveries under certain restrictions and at certain rates of charges.  The company which Mr. Wattles now attempts to exclude from the grounds is the first one to apply for permission to make delivery of express matter under the action of the executive committee; the first to be granted that permission by the executive committee, and it purchased in regular form the first season wagon ticket ever issued by the exposition for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>"As compensation for the rights and privileges granted, the American District Telegraph company agreed to pay the exposition 25 per cent of the daily gross receipts from all sources arising from the operation of the concession during the continuance of said exposition.  Up to 12 o'clock noon August 22 not one cent had been credited on the books of the exposition on account of this concession, nor on any other account.  Still the president resorts to underhanded tactics to protect this outfit against honest competition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">REASON FOR SUCH ACTION.</head>
                            <p>Inquiry of Mr. Babcock, who was Mr. Owens' chief, elicited the statement that Owens was asked to resign because he was connected with the Consolidated Express Delivery company, and secured a permit for that company to enter the grounds to deliver goods.  Mr. Babcock said this was in violation of the rules of the executive committee, which forbade an employe having any interest in any concession.  He said he believed the rule was being violated in other departments, but he was determined that it should not be in his department.</p>
                            <p>Other officials intimated very broadly that Owens had not given the A. D. T. a fair shake in the <choice><sic>mater</sic><corr>matter</corr></choice> of permits, and that in some cases it had required a cash consideration to secure favors <choice><sic>desidered</sic><corr>desired</corr></choice> at the hands of that department.</p>
                            <p>The exhibitors seem to be very decided in their stand against the situation as it existed before the new company was given a chance to enter the grounds, and are up in arms at the prospect of a return to the old situation.  A full investigation is being made into the conditions existing with reference to transportation matters inside the grounds, and it is stated that an interesting situation is being uncovered.</p>

                            <p>The Giant See Saw was designed by A. J. Dyer of Nashville, Tenn., and was never operated prior to the Tennessee Centennial exposition.  It is patented and owned by C. H. De Zevallos of Nashville.  It is built with a factor of "safety of nine," which means it will carry nine times its possible load.  The large factor of safety in its construction, together with machinery, being built double makes it impossible for an accident or a hitch to occur.  The See Saw is built entirely of steel, 200,000 pounds of that metal being used in its construction.</p>

Full information will be found in the papers as to the line of march.  All merchants are requested to decorate their places of business along the line of the parade, and the citizens are asked to display flags and bunting at their residences in honor of the occasion.

                            <p>The concert at the music pavilion last night drew the largest crowd that has attended any concert, not excepting those which gathered during June to listen to the Marine band.  It was given by the Mexican band and the exposition chorus, both of which acquitted themselves with credit.  The greater part of the program was instrumental, but during the first part the chorus sang Pinsuti's "Good Night" very sweetly.  The second part consisted mainly of the descriptive piece, "The Spanish-American War," by the Mexican and McCook bands and the male chorus of the exposition.  This, with stereopticon pictures upon a curtain in front of the music pavilion, represented a number of war scenes, <choice><sic>closin gwith</sic><corr>closing with</corr></choice> a grand display of pyrotechnics.  In this the chorus sang "The Soldiers' Farewell" in a manner which deserved the applause it received.</p>

                            <p>"We're whooping it up for the Mondamin Carnival, Sioux City, October 3 to 8.  That's what we are whooping for."</p>
                            <note type="handwritten">W. H. 26 Aug paste here.</note>
                            <p>Bright yellow badges with the above legend are in evidence on the streets of Omaha.  There are 1,500 to 2,000 of them glistening in the sunshine and above them are smiling faces.</p>
                            <p>The Sioux City party came in on three trains, one on the Iowa side early in the morning and two trains, the regular and a special, on the St. Paul and Omaha, the first with nine coaches comfortably filled and the second with eleven coaches uncomfortably crowded.  There were 500 people on the early train, over 600 on the regular and 750 or 800 on the special.  The special left Sioux City at 7:10 yesterday morning, running the 125 miles in four hours, stopping at every station, and arriving at Omaha at 11 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>There was an immense concourse of people at the Webster street depot when the handsomely decorated Sioux City Carnival train pulled in.  Three-fourths of the passengers, men, women and children carried cornstalk cane and many ears of full corn were peeping from the pockets of the men's coats.</p>
                            <p>The official train was met at the depot by Mayor Moores and a dozen of the city officials, most of the aldermen being present.</p>
                            <p>The McCook Military band from the exposition was on hand and as the train came in sight "Hail Columbia" was played in a lively manner and the crowd rushed forward to meet and greet friends.</p>
                            <p>After a short wait at the depot a Missouri Pacific engine was attached to the official cars and the party taken direct to the Twentieth street entrance of the exposition, headed by Mayor Moores and Major Clarkson.</p>

                            <p>Late in the afternoon Mayor Moores and the city officials of Omaha met Mayor J. H. Quick and the city officials of Sioux City around the banqueting board at the Murray hotel.  There were thirty members of the Sioux City official family in the delegation, and most of the officials were accompanied by their wives.  In fact, except four absent aldermen, the entire official staff of the city is in Omaha today, and Sioux City must run itself.</p>
                            <p>The rate from Sioux City to Omaha was $2.25, and a three days' limit.  Up to Wednesday night 800 tickets had been sold in Sioux City alone, and at least 400 were sold yesterday.  The carnival committee had 2,500 badges printed, and the supply was about exhausted upon reaching Omaha.</p>

                            <p>The Sioux City special train was met at the north gate by General Manager Clarkson, Mayor Moores and members of the Omaha city council, and the visitors were escorted to the Auditorium to the music of the Nebraska Brigade band of McCook.  Hundreds of the excursionists formed the audience which listened to the formal exercises of the day.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores for the city bade the guests welcome with many fine compliments for Sioux City and the state of Iowa and sanguine prophecy as to the destiny of the Missouri river cities.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Quick of Sioux City responded with a few remarks of acknowledgment and of the good relations that should exist between what it was a pleasure to call "the sister cities."</p>
                            <p>General Manager Clarkson offered greeting and good words on behalf of the exposition management.</p>
                            <p>A short speech by Solicitor Gill of Sioux City closed the program.</p>

Thirty-two covers were laid, and an excellent menu spread.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores presided in his usual pleasant manner, and at the conclusion of the lunch Mayor Quick, Judge Gray, Captain Estabrook, F. E. Gill, George Ellerd and W. J.

                            <p>Alderman Mount and Fire Chief Redell each made brief talks.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Burlington Excursion Brings Them From Lincoln and Points Nearer.</head>
                            <p>"Oh, how I wish I were a boy again," exclaimed Harry Deuel, depot master of the Burlington, yesterday, as he stood watching a thousand school children alighting from the Burlington special train of fourteen coaches.  It was pleasing to behold the throng of eager little folks, with smiling faces, lunch baskets and spirits keyed up to the highest pitch the children had come, and under the direction of a local committee, consisting of Mrs. W. W. Keysor, Mrs. Draper Smith, Mrs. Clinton Powell and Mrs. W. P. Harford, were transferred to fifteen Harney street cars, whence they were again transferred to Sherman avenue trains at Fourteenth street and taken to the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>It was the Burlington's first children's day exposition excursion and it was a crackerjack.  A 65-cent round trip fare with only 15 cents as the price of admission to the grounds had tended to bring out a large number of Lincoln and adjoining town little folks.  The party was under the direct supervision of Mrs. A. J. Sawyer, president of the bureau of education.  Mr. and Mrs. Allein Field, Superintendent Saylor of the Lincoln schools, accompanied the children and kept a watchful eye all along the line after their welfare.</p>
                            <p>Lunch baskets were in evidence and everything necessary, including the weather, was provided to make the day enjoyable.</p>
                            <p>The regular Lincoln train brought in three additional coach loads of children at 9:30 o'clock and these were carefully conducted to the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>This made about 1,200 children, all told.</p>
                            <p>Train Dispatcher Robinson saw to it that no mishap occurred during the transfer of the juveniles from the trains to the street cars.  To guard against possible accident the special train was run in over the fourth track, so that the little folks had plenty of room to reach the depot without being crowded.</p>

                            <p>Sioux City did nobly and established its right to have the day named for it at the exposition, but it could not have the exposition all to itself.  The exposition is getting to be too fine a thing to lend, even for one day.  The people from up the river had to permit the participation and allow the claims of the school children along the lines of the Burlington and the Rock Island between Lincoln and Omaha, and indeed the morning was not far spent when it began to look a great deal like everybody's day.  The big crowds from everywhere the have for two or three weeks gladdened the hearts of the managers, were there again.</p>
                            <p>The school children were among the first to crowd the gates.  They had on the way up from the depots, they crowded the street cars, and almost monopolized two lines of street railway.  Inside the gates the gravel and brick walks and the floors of the buildings gave a myriad-multiplied answer to their tread.  Four guards were designated to pay special attentions to them, but for the most part they did as other people do and took care of themselves.</p>
                            <p>The Sioux City people were not far behind with their three train loads.</p>
                            <p>And all the time unbadged and unheralded public poured in at all the principal gates so that the prospect seemed to be of a day of 15,000 or 20,000.</p>

                            <p>The local committee guarantees that it will have 4,000 men in the parade, and that means an attendance of double as many thousand more.  Most of the men will be in uniformed companies.  In the line will be a chorus of fifty singers, fourteen bands and twelve magnificent floats, representing the legends, fables and tales of the fatherland.</p>
                            <p>To facilitate the entry of this large number into the grounds, tickets will be provided in advance.  One ticket seller will be sent to the drug store at Thirteenth and William streets and another to the Pokrok Zapadu office, 1211 South Thirteenth street, at 8 o'clock Saturday morning to remain there while the procession is forming and until it moves away.</p>
                            <p>A drill by 150 Turners will be given on the exposition grounds.</p>

Mr. Ostrom says this small balance will not be more than enough to cover the expense of removing the county exhibit from the exposition grounds and other minor incidental expenses which may be incurred during the remaining days of the exposition, and will not suffice to allow of any appropriation towards Douglas county day at the exposition or any other event.</p>

                            <p>The manager of Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.'s exhibit is developing a right arm equal to that of Colonel Bryan in the exercise of handshaking with old customers of this great mail order house.  The farmers, mechanics, teachers and bankers are flocking to the exposition these days and all show a lively inclination to visit the wonderful exhibit and the splendid entertainment and grasp the hand of the representative of the house so well and favorably known to them.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Owens of the transportation department has resigned.  A rumor heard by his friends is that it was owing to a collision with the A. D. T. in which Mr. Owens took the side of the exhibitors in the Horticulture building that he has retired to private life.</p>
                            <p>The Consolidated Express Delivery company, George Miner, manager, a new concern which has undertaken to supplement or rival the A. D. T.'s work, chiefly in the Horticulture building, has run against a snag and its wagon has been ordered out of the grounds.  It is said that the A. D. T. complained that its concession rights were infringed.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent C. N. Rice of the Burlington's Illinois divisions came in on a special car this morning with a party of exposition visitors and went direct to the grounds.</p>

                            <p>One employe of the exposition has been forced to resign because of alleged interest in one of the privileges granted under the enterprise.  Whether this action on the part of the manager is justified or not in this particular case may be of great importance to the parties immediately affected, but to the public the important question is whether the exposition management is going to overlook more flagrant offenses of the same kind in other and seemingly more favored employes.</p>
                            <p>In spite of the strict rule against any one drawing a salary out of the exposition treasury and profiting from concessions or contracts with the exposition, it is notorious that there are side lines reaching out from several of the most valuable concessions to men of high and low degree on the exposition payroll.  That this is detrimental to the interests of the stockholders as well as in violation of the established rules is too plain to require proof.</p>
                            <p>While there is a committee of audit and revision which might take cognizance of these abuses, full power to correct them rests with the members of the executive committee, which should hew the line close to the mark without regard to where the chips fall.</p>

                            <p>Over 1,000,000 people have now passed through the gates of the Transmississippi Exposition.  Some one of the visitors on the grounds today has the distinction of adding the last unit to the enormous total.  While it is manifestly impossible to locate the individual the mark must have been reached some time between 11 and 12 o'clock this forenoon.  When the gates closed last night the turnstiles recorded an aggregate attendance of 989,638.  This left only 10,362 necessary to reach the grand total of a round million.  As the crowd on the grounds this afternoon is almost as great as on the two previous days this balance will be made up, with enough left to afford a substantial beginning for the millions that are to follow.</p>
                            <p>The fact that the million mark has been reached was regarded with unbounded satisfaction by the exposition officials.  It indicates an average attendance of over 11,500 during the first eighty-seven days of the enterprise.  This is considered a remarkable showing for the opening months, in view of the war and the difficulty of inducing people from a distance to attend an exposition during the summer months.  It encourages the confident belief that during the sixty-six days that remain the total will easily reach the 3,000,000 figure, which was suggested in the beginning as the maximum expectation of the promoters of the enterprise.  The era of increased attendance has already arrived and there is no longer a doubt that during the last two months of the show it will exceed all expectations.  General Manager Clarkson says he is confident that the last day of the show will record more than 2,000,000 paid admissions, and if this figure is even approximated the Transmississippi Exposition will be the most brilliant success in the history of expositions.</p>

                            <p>This is the only off day of the week on the grounds, but this seemed to have no effect on the attendance.  The arrivals poured in steadily all the forenoon and there is every indication that the total will exceed 20,000 again today.  The biggest single party was the excursion on the Port Arthur Route from Chillicothe, Mo., which landed nearly 500 people at the gates.  The school children's excursion which the Union Pacific brought in from Columbus did not compare with the crowd of youngsters that invaded the grounds yesterday, but it contributed 400 people to the total.  No special train was scheduled, but the party was carried on the two regular trains which arrived at 9:40 and 12:30 respectively.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Governors and Leading Men Assist in Work of Promotion of the Jubilee.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Every day the grand Peace Jubilee at the exposition grows in prospect and nothing now seems lacking to make it one of the most notable events that ever occurred on American soil.  The idea has received the unqualified approval of everyone to whom it has been suggested.  The announcement that President McKinley to come to the jubilee is followed by expressions of hearty co-operation from nearly all the governors of the Transmississippi states.  Some days ago President Wattles addressed letters to each of the governors asking them to co-operate with the exposition management in extending a formal invitation to President McKinley and a large proportion of them have already replied.  They have transmitted formal invitations in the name of their respective states, which will be presented to President McKinley by the special committee which will wall on him September 3.  Governor Holcomb's letter is the following:</p>
                            <p>EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, LINCOLN, Neb., Aug. 19, 1898.&#8212;To the President:  It has been suggested that a great Peace Jubilee be held at the Transmississippi and International Exposition, Omaha, to celebrate the termination of the war with Spain, in which the American nation has acquitted itself with so much glory.  A committee from the Transmississippi and International Exposition and prominent men of the west will join in urging your presence upon this occasion.  I beg to express the hope that you will honor the state and the exposition by accepting the invitation of the exposition committee.  The citizens of Nebraska will gladly welcome you to the state and would highly appreciate such evidence of your good will for this exposition.  I have the honor to be, with great respect, yours very truly,</p>

                            <p>Governor William A. Richards of Wyoming extends a hearty solicitation from himself and people as follows:</p>
                            <p>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, CHEYENNE, Wyo., Aug. 18, 1898.&#8212;His Excellency, William McKinley, President of the United States, Washington, D. C.:  Sir&#8212;I am informed that it is the intention of the managers of the Transmississippi and International Exposition now being held at Omaha, Neb., to have a Peace Jubilee on their grounds at some convenient date in celebration of the victorious conclusion of the war with Spain.  It would be especially fitting to have this occasion honored by the chief executive of the nation, whose wise, patriotic and arduous labors have brought about this happy result.</p>
                            <p>In the name of the people of the state of Wyoming, who have contributed in a modest way to this exposition, I extend to you an earnest and heartfelt invitation to attend this great Peace Jubilee and I assure you that we will esteem it an honor to do all within <choice><sic>onr</sic><corr>our</corr></choice> power to make your visit pleasant and enjoyable and we hope not wholly unprofitable.  Very respectfully yours,</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Similar letters have also been received from Governors D. M. Clough of Minnesota, Leslie M. Shaw of Iowa, Joseph W. Devine of North Dakota, Alva Adams of Colorado and C. M. Barnes of Oklahoma.  The governors of Utah, Oregon, Montana and other states have telegraphed that their letters are on the way and within a few days it is expected that the committee will be provided with invitations from the governors of all the states that are represented at the exposition.  Aside from these formal communications a large number of personal letters have been received expressing the heartiest approval of the plan and promising all possible assistance in making it a tremendous success.</p>

                            <p>The special committee that will call on President McKinley September 3 to deliver the formal invitation of the transmississippi <choice><sic>eople</sic><corr>people</corr></choice> has been appointed by President Wattles, in conformity with the recent action of the board of directors.  It consists of Senators Thurston and Allen, Congressman Mercer and John L. Webster, John C. Wharton and General J. C. Cowin.  The committee will probably leave Omaha about the middle of next week.</p>
                            <p>The decision of the Chicago people to limit their celebration to a two days' demonstration is regarded as removing any possibility that it would conflict with the exposition jubilee.  The latter will be the great peace celebration of the United States, and its magnitude will not suffer on account of the Chicago jubilation.  It was at first proposed to raise $250,000 for a big demonstration at Chicago, but more recently the committee in charge determined to limit the celebration to two days and to cut the financial expenditure in half.  They expect to induce President McKinley and his cabinet to stop off on their way back from Omaha and the Chicago spectacle will therefore be practically supplementary to the Omaha affair.</p>
                            <p>The exposition management is taking its time in working out the details of the jubilee week celebration, as it is proposed that nothing shall be overlooked that can add to the scope of the demonstration.  It has been definitely decided that three days of the week will be celebrated as Military day, Naval day and Industrial day respectively, and various plans are being considered to make the most of each occasion.  Monday, October 10, will be marked merely by the formal opening of the jubilee.  This, however, will be on an expensive scale and will be a fitting inauguration of such a vast enterprise.  The opening exercises will probably be held in the Auditorium, and some of the most distinguished orators in the United States will participate in the program.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Idea for Naval Day.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles is working out a novel idea in connection with the celebration of Naval day.  He was anxious that there should be some spectacular demonstration that would be in harmony with the occasion, but hope to accomplish this with no larger body of water than the lagoon to work on was a difficult question.  He finally hit on the plan of putting on a realistic reproduction of the sinking of the Merrimac in Santiago harbor and after some discussion it has been pronounced entirely feasible.  The construction of the lagoon is especially favorable for the spectacle.  The broad mirror will very aptly represent the harbor and the narrower part of the lagoon will answer perfectly for the entrance.  A ship will be constructed which will resemble the Merrimac as nearly as possible and this will be propelled down the lagoon under fire from the Spanish forts, which will be constructed on each side.  Lieutenant Hobson and his crew will also be in evidence and just as they reach the narrow entrance to the mirror the ship will be blown up and sunk.  Then the crew will be rescued by a Spanish boat and taken away to Morro castle.  It is believed that with the resources now on the grounds this event can be put on in a wonderfully realistic manner and be one of the most striking features of the jubilee.  A big fireworks display will be given every night during the week and Manager Due is already at work on novel and elaborate designs for the various occasions.</p>

                            <p>The indications now are that the entire floor space in the Horticultural building will be occupied before the end of the week.  Mrs. Chute, secretary of the Colorado Horticultural society, has written to Superintendent Taylor that the Colorado exhibit has been shipped and that men are coming from Denver to put it in place.  She says that the entire 1,400 feet of floor space will be occupied and that the exhibit will be made up of that the best that the orchards and vineyards of the state produce.</p>
                            <p>Colorado's space in the Horticultural building is just across the hall and south of the Oregon exhibit, the second exhibit on the right, east of the west entrance of the building.  The space could have been sold a dozen times during the past month, but as it was contracted for by the Colorado people, the exposition managers felt in duty bound to hold it, notwithstanding the fact that the time for having the exhibit in place expired long ago.  In writing to Superintendent Taylor, Mrs. Chute says that the Colorado fruit is exceptionally fine this year and that for this reason she will have some fine specimens and a large quantity and numerous varieties to show.</p>
                            <p>Slow progress is being made in installing the Idaho exhibit, which is to be located in the Horticultural building, just west of the space taken by the Colorado.  The tables and shelving were made and placed some days ago, but as yet no fruit has arrived, though it is expected any day.</p>
                            <p>The fruit exhibit made by Douglas county continues to grow in size and at the same time it continues to attract a great deal of attention.  At this time the exhibition of grapes seem to be the fad and the long tables are well covered with the fruit, some thirty varieties being exhibited.  These are neatly arranged around the outside of the tables, while the centers are filled with peaches of various kinds and colors, making a most attractive display.  The largest exhibitor of grapes is Phil Mergen, a farmer residing just outside the city limits of Omaha.  He is showing something like twenty different <choice><sic>varities</sic><corr>varieties</corr></choice>, including Moore's Early, Concord and Worden.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Stanton of the Illinois exhibit is getting in line to show peaches from the state from which he comes.  He is clearing his tables of old apples and before the end of the week will have them pretty well filled with peaches from the state from which he comes.  He is clearing his tables of old apples and before the end of the week will have them pretty well filled with peaches.  His display at this time, including such well known varieties as Reeves' favorites, Albertas and Champions.  He has telegraphed for more and completed arrangements by which in the future fresh fruit will arrive daily.  The Illinois apples of last year that were held in cold storage are coming out remarkably well, especially the Janets, a barrel of which came in yesterday.  The fruit seemed to be as sound and solid as on the day when it was picked, hardly any even being specked.</p>
                            <p>Iowa's apples and grapes are showing up well and in abundant quantities.  The exhibit has been increased largely during the past week and now Superintendent Collman has placed himself in communication with the fruit growers whereby he does not anticipate any difficulty in securing all of the fruit that will be required to keep his exhibit in first-class condition.</p>
                            <p>Additions are daily being made to the Los Angeles county exhibit from southern California.  Yesterday a large invoice of fresh lemons, Valencia late oranges, Bishop's crystallized fruits, prepared citron, six varieties of grapes, Kelsey Japan plums.  Alexander apples, oranges, cling peaches and Hungarian prunes came along.  A large number of photographic views of orchards and ranches have been received.  The consignment includes views of J. E. Packard's Pomona ranch, which is said to be the largest in the state.</p>

                            <p>President Carr of the Illinois Exposition commission and Mrs. Carr are on the grounds.  It has been some time since President Carr has been in the city and in speaking of the exposition he said:  "Many changes have been wrought during my absence, but all of them have been for the better.  The exposition has improved wonderfully.  Everything has taken on a more finished appearance and everything seems to be running along in a business way.</p>
                            <p>"The exposition is a great show and its name and fame are being heralded far and near.  Our people know of it and they are coming here in large numbers as soon as the weather cools off a little.  Already thousands of them have been here, as the register in the state building will bear testimony.  They always boom the exposition when they return home and the result has been that a wonderful exposition sentiment has been worked up in Illinois.</p>
                            <p>"Chicago day, as everybody knows, has been set for October 1 and if nothing happens to prevent it we will show Omaha a crowd at that time.  The war is over and business has settled back into routine channels and as a result the people have time to think and lay plans and as a result of this they are coming out here in large numbers.  Our merchants and manufacturers are anxious to hold and acquire the trade of the great west and to cultivate the acquaintance of the business men and they feel that they must come to Omaha and get in touch with them.  This they can do by visiting the exposition and this they will do."</p>

They arrived yesterday in a private car and will remain here several days.  This is the first time that Superintendent Rice has visited the exposition since long before the opening.  Discussing the great show he said:  "It exceeds all conception and is well worth traveling long distances to see and should be attended by people from all over the country, as it will be long before the closing day.  While I understand that there is a fair attendance at this time it will be much greater when the railroad rate question is adjusted, which I feel certain will be before many days.  Omaha and the exposition will secure

                            <head type="sub">One Trouble Settled Just in Time to Encounter a Bigger.</head>
                            <p>In one respect the woes of the exhibitors in the Horticulture building are at an end.  Heretofore it has been the rule that all consignments of fresh fruit must be delivered on the grounds before 8 o'clock in the morning.  With the trains arriving later in the morning and during the afternoon, it was impossible to comply with this regulation and as a result, much of the fruit spoiled by lying in the freight houses or in the express offices for hours after arriving in the city.  Now a rule has been promulgated by which fruit may be delivered during all hours of the day.</p>
                            <p>While the fruit men have disposed of one trouble, they still have another and this is due to the face that there are certain conductors on the Sherman avenue street car line who studiously ignore the fact that there is an entrance to the exposition grounds in the vicinity of the Horticulture building.  The exhibitors and men in charge of state buildings on the Bluff tract have urged upon the trainmen the importance of stopping at this entrance, but instead of doing so, many of them run their trains a block or two past the gate and then stop.  Passengers who had intended to get off the cars and visit the Bluff tract, rather than walk back to the gate, prefer to remain on the cars and ride up to the entrance under the viaduct.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday the exhibitors and others employed on the Bluff tract decided to adopt heroic measures.  They prepared a statement of facts, setting forth the action of the motormen and conductors in not calling out the Bluff tract entrance and in not stopping their trains at the gates.  This was signed by all of the interested parties and will be forwarded to the street railway officials, who will be asked to take some action to compel their employes to regard the wishes of those who travel on the line.</p>

                            <p>While the Indians are not doing much in the way of giving dances, indulging in races and putting up sham battles they have gone into business and propose to make a little money.  They have opened a store on the south side of the grounds and have appointed Clerk Hegge of Captain Mercer's office force to look after the sale of the goods.</p>
                            <p>Ever since the Indians came to the exposition they have been hawking bows, arrows, bead work and trinkets on the streets.  In many instances they have been badly cheated.  Recently some of the old men decided to stop this and manage if possible to obtain at least a fair value for the stuff that the Indians had to sell.  How to go about it they did not know, and it was at this point that Hegge was called.  He <choice><sic>suggesed</sic><corr>suggested</corr></choice> the establishment of a store.

The Indians take their articles to him and he registers the name of the owner and the sales value.  When the articles are sold an account is kept, and once each week a settlement is had.  The plan works well and the Indians are securing quite a neat sum of money from the sale of their trinkets.</p>

                            <p>Agent Van Arnam of the Department of Admissions, who came in with the children from Lincoln, says he knows to a cent how much each youngster spent at the exposition.  He started out to provide them all with tickets on the road, and as the 15 cent tickets made it necessary to make change in every case, he loaded himself to his capacity with small change.  But he struck a proposition that would test the small change resources of a national bank.  Every last one of the youngsters was provided with a railroad ticket and a silver dollar.  By the time he had got through one car and handed out 85 cents in change to each passenger he was long on dollars, but his stock of small coins were nearly annihilated.  And there were fourteen more cars just like it ahead.  He worked like a Trojan during the entire trip, and when the train pulled into Omaha he was still two cars shy of completing his task.  With a half-dozen exceptions he had to disburse 85 cents to every child on the train, and this meant counting out over $800 in small change in exchange for a small wagon load of silver dollars.</p>

                            <p>Last night's crowd furnished another object lesson on the 25 cent rate proposition.  This went into effect at 6 o'clock, and by that hour the rush toward the grounds was <unclear reason="torn"/> of the day.  People kept pouring through the turnstiles until 8 o'clock, and all the evening the grounds were crowded.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the reduced rate the only attraction was the second rendition of the spectacular fantasie based on scenes from the Spanish war.  It drew a crowd that packed the entire reserved space in front of the band stand soon after 7 o'clock, and hundreds of people who were willing to pay for seats were turned away.  Even the standing room on the Plaza was almost entirely occupied, and the crowd received the spectacle with even more enthusiastic approbation than that which accompanied the previous performance.  One or two unavoidable hitches that marred the entertainment Tuesday night were happily absent, and the crowd was thoroughly delighted.  It is not unlikely that the fantasie will be repeated next week.</p>

                            <p>It was expected that the butter scoring contest would come on today, but the indications now are that it will go over until next week, owing to some delay in getting things in shape.  This delay makes the Minnesota people feel slightly disgusted, as they were given to understand that the scoring would take place last Tuesday.  Their principal objection to the delay is the cost, which averages some $15 per day.  They shipped down 1,500 pounds of butter and put it into a refrigerator that uses up $8 worth of ice every twenty-four hours.  In addition to this are the wages paid to men who are employed to look after the butter and keep it in good condition.</p>
                            <p>Being afraid of the refrigerating plant the Minnesota people took no changes on the artificial freezing.  They secured a big refrigerator as soon as their butter came and placed their butter in that.  The big box eats up ice very rapidly, and consequently each day that the scoring is put off adds to the expense.</p>

                            <p>The meeting of the Nebraska Exposition commission was held yesterday and considerable business was transacted.  The sum of $303.07 was appropriated to complete the educational exhibit which is made by the University of Nebraska.  Chancellor MacLean and Prof. Barbour of the university were invited to appear before the commission at the next meeting and explain why it has cost so much money to put the educational exhibit in place.</p>
                            <p>The sum of $350 was appropriated to be used in making a display of vegetables in connection with the state agricultural exhibit shown in the main buildings.</p>
                            <p>The question of arranging the program for Nebraska day was taken up and discussed, but no action was taken, other than to request the chairman and the secretary to confer with the exposition directory with reference to the date and the railroads relative to making cheap rates from all points in the state.  This committee will make its report at the next meeting of the commission.</p>
                            <p>The commission voted to purchase 1,000 copies of Dougherty's Magazine, which is to contain an exhaustive article on the Nebraska exhibits made in the several buildings.  The price to be paid for the copies of the publication is $100 delivered.</p>

                            <p>Next Thursday night the United States life saving crew, commanded by Captain Knowles, will give an exhibition drill on the lagoon by electric light.  This will not interfere with the usual exhibition in the afternoon.  There has been a general desire to see the drill at night, and this has been especially vigorous from clerks and others who were unable to get out in the daytime.  Captain Knowles has been ready to put on the drill any evening, but the management has interfered on account of other attractions.  Next Thursday night the drill will have the right of way and will begin promptly at 7:45.  It will be decidedly more realistic than the daylight drill, as the crews will be able to use the night signals, which are impossible in the daytime.</p>

                            <head type="sub">No News Yet from the Western Passenger Association Meeting&#8212;Double-Header Trains the Usual Thing Out of Omaha.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>While the passenger men in Omaha are waiting to learn the results of the conference of the Western Passenger association in Chicago on the proposition to grant reasonable rates to this city during the remainder of the exposition, they have an opportunity to size up present conditions and speculate on the future.  Omaha is represented at the meeting by General Passenger Agents Francis of the B. &amp; M. and Buchanan of the Elkhorn, and the latter is also representing the Union Pacific.  Nothing has been heard from the Omaha general passenger agents except that they will not be home until Saturday or Sunday, the meeting proving more lengthy than was anticipated.</p>
                            <p>The conference was called to order on Thursday morning and has been in session since then, except on Thursday evening.  From the time spent in conference without results, so far as is known here, it is presumed that the effort to secure better rates for Omaha is playing havoc with the association.  Omaha passenger men still profess confidence that a lower line of rates will be put into effect on or before September 1, no matter what action the association may take.  Chairman Caldwell has been very successful in his efforts to hold off cheap rates till September 1, but it is certain that his opposition will no longer avail.</p>

                            <p>The splendid amount of travel that is coming in here every day now is sufficient to prove to many that the attendance at the exposition would be enormous if lower rates were named.  Regular travel is very heavy, and it is hard work to secure a lower berth on any of the afternoon trains to Chicago on the same day that one is to travel.  The afternoon trains to the west are also heavy, from thirteen to seventeen cars being needed on trains No. 3 on the Union Pacific and on the Burlington every afternoon.  The latter train has gone out of here with two locomotives nearly every afternoon for ten days past.  The incoming crowds continue to increase in size and in the frequency of their arrival.  The largest excursion today was brought in by the Port Arthur Route from Chillicothe, Mo., and vicinity.  The party numbered 450, and filled a special train of eight coaches and a baggage car.  The excursionists left Chillicothe on Thursday night at 9:45 o'clock and arrived here on Friday morning at 7:30 o'clock.  They will return home on Sunday night, their tickets being of such limits as to give them three days at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Union Pacific helped to swell Friday's attendance at the big show by bringing in several hundred children from Columbus, Neb., and points along the line between there and here, excepting Fremont.  The children's excursion tickets were not sold at Fremont because of an agreement with the Elkhorn to look after that town on a separate date.  Both the Elkhorn and the Union Pacific have lines from Fremont to Omaha, but the competition for traffic between the two lines is not as keen as it used to be.  The Union Pacific brought in about 250 children on train No. 8, arriving here at 9:40 a. m., and about 100 more on the noon train.</p>

On and after Sunday next the Creston local will arrive at the Burlington station at 9:15 a. m., instead of at 10:45 a. m.  Returning it will leave here for Creston at 11:40 p. m., instead of at 4:10 p. m.  The change will give passengers on these trains nine hours longer to remain in Omaha, or at the exposition.  The trains will continue to be carded as Nos. 9 and 10.</p>

                            <p>CHICAGO, Aug. 26.&#8212;The Western Passenger association lines have determined to decide the question regarding the reduction of the rates for the Omaha Exposition one way or the other before adjournment this evening.

                            <p>The exposition grounds are filling up this afternoon at a rate that indicates that the record for Saturday attendance is likely to go up another notch.  The Bohemian day celebration is one of the biggest single features that has yet been pulled off in connection with the show and the general disposition of the people of that nationality to co-operate in making it a success is apparent in the numbers in which they congregated from all over the transmississippi territory.  The attendance during the early part of the day was not remarkable, as a large proportion of the visitors remained down town until after the parade.  But later on they poured into the grounds by thousands.  The arrival of the parade shortly after noon contributed a pretty fair crowd in itself and at the same time the street railway company was bringing all the people it could haul.  There seemed to be no doubt that the attendance would run well over 20,000 before night and that means the biggest week in the history of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The school children's excursion from Auburn, Weeping Water and intermediate points added about 400 youngsters to the crowd.  The children arrived on the regular Missouri Pacific train shortly before 10 o'clock and were received at the north gate by Secretary Ford and other representatives of the Women's Broad of Managers.  They had been provided with tickets on the train by a representative of the Admissions department and were promptly marshaled through the gates and dismissed in groups to enjoy their holiday until 9:30 tonight, when they will be taken home on a special train.</p>

                            <p>While nearly every remaining day of the show will be made notable by from one to half a dozen special features, the great peace jubilee celebration is regarded as the premier event of the exposition.  The special committee will start for Washington in a few days to confer with President McKinley, and in the meantime President Wattles is personally pushing the local preparations.  At a conference with the board of governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben he induced them to agree to furnish the feature for at least one of the evenings of jubilee week.  The knights will put their best parade on in the main court, and it is possible that they will also occupy an additional evening.  These parades will include the best features of their street demonstrations during carnival week, and they will be made even more elaborate for the latter occasion.</p>
                            <p>The entire country seems to have discovered that the celebration is going to be the biggest event that has ever occurred in the west.  President Wattles is receiving numerous communications from all parts of the United States which contain the most enthusiastic assurances of interest and co-operation.  Among these is a vigorous letter from Tom Richardson, secretary of the Houston Business league, who urges the importance of impressing the business men of the transmississippi cities with the importance of giving loyal support to the Omaha celebration.</p>
                            <p>With a return to the 25-cent Sunday admission the prospect for a good crowd on the grounds tomorrow is encouraging.  The attendance on previous Sundays has been a convincing argument that the people do not propose to pay half a dollar to see half a show.  Last Sunday the total attendance was 9,124, and on the preceding Sunday it <unclear reason="torn"/> handicapped the attendance record materially on the first day of the week, but the management is convinced that tomorrow night will record a different story.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Directors Decide on Two More Occasions for the 25-Cent Rate.</head>
                            <p>The board of directors succeeded in getting a quorum yesterday and in completing the order of business before adjournment.  As this is the first occasion since the exposition opened on which it has accomplished this feat the minutes will be recorded in red ink.  The principal results of the meeting consist in an effectual suppression of the disposition manifested by the special investigating committee to look into some of the proceedings of the department managers and a partial victory for the advocates of a 25-cent admission on Sunday and evenings.  From now on the reduced rate will be in force on Sundays and on Monday and Thursday evenings.</p>
                            <p>The question of limiting or unlimiting the powers of the investigating committee was left in abeyance, when the previous meeting adjourned.  When the board convened yesterday President Wattles announced that Casper E. Yost's motion that the committee be given the broadest possible scope was before the house.  Chairman Kilpatrick of the special committee then read three resolutions which he had prepared and suggested that the board adopt the one that suited its purpose.  One of the resolutions gave the committee full latitude, another limited its investigations to specific charges of fraud or corruption and errors in the books and the thirds provided that it might investigate matters in which the exposition alone is concerned, but prohibited any meddling with matters at issue between exposition officials and outside interests.</p>
                            <p>Herman Kountze had also prepared a resolution which was very similar to the last one read by Mr. Kilpatrick.  It gave the committee power to audit books and accounts and to investigate written charges of dishonesty or corruption on the part of any official or employe, but it was not to concern itself with matters of equity in which no dishonesty or misappropriation was involved.  This was offered as a substitute for Mr. Yost's motion and was adopted without opposition.</p>
                            <p>At the request of Manager Lindsey the action taken at the previous meeting, directing certain changes in the office system, was suspended and Accountant Streeter, Chairman Kilpatrick of the auditing committee and Secretary Wakefield were directed to recommend an improved system at the next meeting.  Mr. Lindsey objected to the previous action on the ground that it had a tendency to cripple the operation of his department.  He referred particularly to the provision that no checks should be cashed at the secretary's office, saying that many people had to be paid late Saturday night and as they are frequently strangers, unknown at the banks, it is advisable to pay them at the grounds and turn in the vouchers.</p>
                            <p>The protest of Central Labor Union against the employment of the Cosmopolitan band was placed on file.</p>
                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick brought up the question of 25-cent admissions and moved that that rate be put in force every Monday night in addition to Thursday night, which had previously been provided for.  This renewed the discussion that has occupied the bulk of the last three meetings and the question was complicated by a half dozen amendments and substitutes in the course of the debate.  When it was finally untangled the motion contemplated a 25-cent Sunday rate also and it was adopted in that form by 17 to 14.</p>
                            <p>Pass Inspector Mitchell reported that he had checked up the concessionaires' passes carefully and had found that some have passes who are not entitled to them.  Each case has been reported to the department of admissions and the passes canceled.  He also found that the wagon passes are being largely abused and the result of his investigation in that line has been to increase the receipts from that source from $6 to $10.50 a day.  He promised a detailed report in a short time.</p>
                            <p>Clement Chase was represented by another demand for an additional season pass, which was voted.  The secretary was directed to produce a list of all season passes issued to date at the next meeting.</p>

Commissioner Driscoll says that this year the Idaho fruit crop is unusually fine and abundant, and he has no hesitancy in venturing the opinion that when the time for making awards rolls around, he will be well in the lead.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Walker, in charge of the Douglas county fruit exhibit, is proud of a lot of plums that have just been placed on exhibit.  They were propagated by Theodore Williams, a farmer residing near Omaha, and have been named the Omaha Exposition plum on account of this being the first time that they have ever been seen by the public.  Last year Mr. Williams raised a few.  This year his supply is limited, as the trees have hardly commenced to bear.  The Omaha plum is a bright blue, very dark and as round as a ball.  This plum is very meaty and when ripe is soft, but firm.  Bob Douglas, a farmer residing near Elkhorn, has sent in some Hungarian plums that are richly colored and are as large as the plums that come from California, and which occasion so much favorable comment on account of their enormous size.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Stanton, in charge of the Illinois fruit, is in high feather over the fact that he has just received word from Senator Dunlap, who has informed him that the Illinois commission has appropriated an additional $700 to be used in keeping up and in enlarging the Illinois exhibit.  This leaves Superintendent Stanton with about $1,700 to run the exhibit during the two remaining months of the exposition.  With this money and the interest that is being taken by the Illinois horticulturists, he says that he can keep up an exhibit that will be second to none in the building.  Some time within the next two weeks he will return home and will remain several days visiting the orchards and deciding just what he wants sent on for exhibition.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Graham, who is in charge of the Wigwam on the Bluff tract, has succeeded in working up a deep interest among the farmers and fruit raisers of Pottawattamie county and the products of the farms and orchards are pouring in upon him at a lively rate.  He is receiving an abundance of grapes, apples and plums, while he is almost swamped with corn, wheat, oats, rye and barley.  The corn, however, is his pride and joy and he is showing some that makes that big corn from Texas feel small.  Stalks nineteen feet high are shown.  They are well eared, some of the ears starting out as high as ten feet from the ground.</p>
                            <p>During the last few days a large number of Pottawattamie county farmers have been upon the exposition grounds and a majority of those who have called at the Wigwam have informed Superintendent Graham that most of the corn of the county is matured and out of the way of the frost.  The yield will be up to the average.</p>

                            <p>Governor W. J. Northen of Georgia writes an interesting letter to the Atlanta Constitution in which he discusses some of the ideas that he gathered at the exposition.  In his opinion one great purpose of the show is to solve the question how best to seek investments and he comments on the great variety of methods adopted by communities and individuals to get their wares before the public.  He also refers to the great number of congresses and conventions that occur in connection with the exposition, but is evidently not entirely pleased with the ideas that he heard advanced at the White and Colored American Congress.  His understanding is that when the colored orators spoke of personal liberty they spoke of social equality.  In this connection he predicts that the north and west are now entering on an era in their history that they will sometime seek in vain to remedy.  He says that the discussion of the "social equality" question it having its legitimate effect in attracting the negroes from the south to such localities as guarantee them this distinction.  Since 1860 the colored population of Nebraska has increased from eighty-two to 9,000, Kansas from 627 to 50,000, Iowa from 1,000 to 11,000, Michigan from 7,000 to 15,000 and Indiana from 11,000 to 45,000.  He advises the southern people to sit still and wait while the north solves the race problem by turning over all objectionable classes of negroes to be transformed into "white folks" by those white people who invite them to "social equality."</p>

                            <p>On several occasions during the last two months the young people of the city have given private dancing parties at the New York building on the Bluff tract.  They have been very enjoyable functions and have been voted just the thing after the evening fireworks.  The dances commence at about 9 o'clock and continue until midnight.  The last one was given Thursday night.  The dances are given exclusively to the young people, the New York commission kindly loaning the use of the building.</p>
                            <p>The New York building on the exposition grounds is in a conspicuous location, just east of the Horticulture building.  It is modest and unpretentious, but architecturally attractive and especially suited for the lovely surroundings of green lawns, gorgeous flower beds on one side and with the river, the State and other exposition buildings on the other.  Its colonial character, broad piazzas, lofty ceilings, light and airy decorations of blue and white and other harmonious colors present an appearance of comfort and welcome that invites the educated eye and weary soul and body, giving a sense of comfort and restfulness not often found in public places or elsewhere.  A well known Omaha woman in speaking of the New York building said:  "It is so delightfully dainty and restful, with an air of comfort, it exhibits great taste in its harmonious arrangement of colors, selection of furniture and decoration.  Everything about it is so modest, but so very tasteful, stylish and appropriate."</p>

                            <p>The Old Plantation, the darkey show on the Midway, is in the hands of the exposition and the voice of the pastor of Mount Nebo chapel is no longer heard in the land.  The grand finale came yesterday afternoon when the concessionaire refused to square his account that has been running during the last two months.</p>
                            <p>About two months ago there was a fire at the Old Plantation and some of the property, including Mount Nebo chapel, burned.  It was rebuilt, and as the proprietor seemed to be in hard lines, the exposition officials allowed him to run along without paying for his power and light and without turning in his percentage.  Yesterday the chief of the Department of Concessions called upon Proprietor McConnell and demanded a settlement and the payment of $900.  The proprietor gave the exposition man the laugh and informed him that instead of the Old Plantation owing the exposition, the exposition owed the concession.  When asked how this could be figured out, the concessionaire stated that the exposition allowed the fire to burn and that thereby he was damaged much more than the amount that was claimed.  This statement came like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky, as the exposition man had no knowledge that the exposition was insuring against fires or acts of providence.  The concessionaire would not listen to argument, nor would he settle, so as a last resort the doors to his establishment were locked from the outside and the keys delivered at the service building.</p>

Admiral Brown was enthusiastic in his praise of the exposition, judging it from a personal comparison with other held in the last twenty-five years.  In its perfection of detail and general effect he thought that it was unsurpassed even by the World's fair and as for other recent expositions the admiral said "they weren't a picayune side show."  The government exhibit seemed to Admiral Brown more complete and satisfactory than any which have gone before and he remarked that those in charge of its arrangement seemed to have profited by their previous experiments in what is interesting and profitable for public inspection.</p>

It is now proposed to give them a free trip some time next month.

                            <head type="sub">Washington Authorities Show Great Interest in the Exposition and Lend Much Assistance to Make It a Success.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Edward Rosewater returned this morning from Washington, whither he went at the behest of the managers of the exposition to invite President McKinley to attend the Peace Jubilee early in October.</p>
                            <p>In an interview Mr. Rosewater said:  "I have been out nine days and have had a very successful tour.  Before starting for Washington I labored under the impression that Chicago had given up its proposed peace jubilee, but upon my arrival there eastbound I found that they had reconsidered and decided to make an effort to get the president to attend their demonstration.  In order to avoid any conflict with Chicago, which has a representative in the cabinet in Secretary Gage, I communicated with their committee of arrangements and was invited to a conference with President Revell of the Union League club and Ferdinand Peck.  They expressed themselves as very anxious to co-operate and I promised to report to them what disposition the president seemed to evince regarding his proposed western tour.</p>
                            <p>"Arriving at Washington on Saturday morning I succeeded in securing an interview by appointment at 3 p. m.  I was accompanied by Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn.  The president appeared to be very favorably inclined.  He paid a high compliment to the pluck and energy of the exposition management which had carried out its plans in the face of war.  The president was also highly pleased with the painting of the Grand Court which I presented on behalf of the exposition.  That picture is now hung up in the White House and will be a reminder there for years to come of the great achievement at Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Gets Positive Assurance.</head>
                            <p>"When I read the report sent out by the Associated Press to the New York papers which seemed to indicate that the president had not yet made up his mind with reference to a western tour, I decided to have a second interview and to make sure that nothing had happened to cause the president to change his mind.  As I had at the first interview secured a promise from the president of a signed photograph to be hung up in The Bee building, I had a good excuse for returning to the White House.  At the second interview the president was very positive that he fully intended to visit Omaha, there being no question except as to the time and possible complications that no one could foresee.</p>
                            <p>"All the cabinet officers were out of the city on my arrival, attending the New York naval review.  On their return last Monday I succeeded in interviewing five of them and each promised to participate in our celebration on Cabinet day.  The fact that they all seemed to have fallen in with the idea indicated clearly that the president had already mentioned the matter to them.</p>
                            <p>"Just before closing my first interview with the president I broached the Chicago matter and the president waved his hand, stating that Chicago was quite able to take care of itself, and I thereupon dropped the subject.  While in New York I received the following telegram from Postmaster Gordon of Chicago:</p>
                            <p>"'Anxious to communicate with reference to the president's visit to Omaha.  Chicago people want to co-operate with you.'  This telegram indicates that Secretary Gage himself had not been able to get the president to commit himself to a promise to stop over in Chicago, coming or going, but in all probability he will do so.</p>
                            <p>"On my arrival in Chicago on the return trip the Times-Herald had this to say:</p>
                            <p>"President McKinley has accepted the invitation to attend the Peace Jubilee in October.  He will possibly be accompanied by Lyman J. Gage, secretary of the treasury, and John D. Long, secretary of the navy.</p>
                            <p>"The Jubilee executive committee rejoiced yesterday over the receipt of this news from Washington.  Edward Rosewater of Omaha, who went east to see the president, verified the news of the president's contemplated attendance at the Jubilee in a telegram announcing that the president had given positive assurance that he would visit Chicago while enroute to the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>"Mr. Rosewater, representing the Omaha Exposition, conferred with the Jubilee committee before he went to Washington and agreed upon a date which would give the president an opportunity to attend both cities without personal inconvenience.  The <unclear reason="torn"/> been tendered by W. R. Harper, chairman of the invitation committee.  Much depended on Mr. Rosewater's visit.  Formal acceptance is expected by mail within a few days.</p>
                            <p>"The news of the president's decision created great enthusiasm.</p>

                            <p>"As to the war balloons and war relics, the exposition is under great obligations to Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn, who has taken special pains to extend all the favors possible.  It was chiefly through his co-operation that we succeeded in getting the balloons, although General Greeley is a personal friend, having resided in Omaha years ago as a signal officer.</p>
                            <p>"The great war balloon which is to become a part of the government exhibit at the exposition was manufactured for the War department at Frankfort, N. Y., of pongee silk.  Its capacity is 21,000 cubic feet, sufficient to carry four persons.  This balloon is equipped with complete telephonic and telegraphic apparatus.  Communication is established by means of insulated wire, paid out as the balloon ascends.  A complete photographic outfit is also part of the equipment.  The hydrogen gas is generated by means of an apparatus consisting of gas generator, gasometer, gas <choice><sic>compresser</sic><corr>compressor</corr></choice>, steam engine and several hundred gas tubes.  These tubes are eight inches in diameter and fifty inches long.  They are seamless, each tube being tested to a pressure of 1,000 pounds to the square inch.  By means of the gas compressor the tubes are filled with hydrogen gas, practically in liquified state.  When the balloon is to be inflated the tubes are connected by means of valves and fittings to the gas chamber in the balloon and inflation is made.  At Santiago this monster balloon was used by the United States signal corps in making observations in conjunction with a number of small balloons of various colors placed so as to indicate the position of each brigade or division.</p>
                            <p>"Another thing that I succeeded in bringing about was the enlargement of the Indian encampment.  The Indians now here are to be reinforced by several hundred red men from the southwest.  Prof. James Mooney of the Smithsonian Institution, who has been delegated for ethnological work, is here now and will proceed to the reservations of the Kiowas, Commanches, Wichitas and associated tribes, Arapahos, Cheyennes and Apaches, under Chief Geronimo, now held as prisoners of war at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  The professor will return with these Indians in about two weeks."</p>

                            <head type="sub">The Omaha Stamps.</head>
                            <p>As is well known, the Omaha stamps are the third special issue that the Government has made to commemorate expositions; they are, however, distinguished above all other emissions by special circumstances of honor, and plentiful ground may be found for the position that in them the United States has more highly favored the Trans-Mississippi Exposition than any similar enterprise that the country has ever seen.</p>
                            <p>For not only have many great fairs with as wide a scope as that at Omaha,&#8212;such enterprises as those at New Orleans, Atlanta, San Francisco and Nashville, been allowed to pursue the tenor of their way without postal recognition, but also in the two cases in which it has before been given, only to expositions of national scope, it has been the event which was commemorated, rather than the exposition which celebrated it.  In the case of Omaha, however, there was no one specific event to commemorate; the government has bestowed all its wealth of postal recognition upon the city and surrounding country in which the fair was held.</p>
                            <p>Thus the commemorative stamp of 1876, an experiment by the way, and a rather crude one, may more properly be said to commemorate the nation's one hundredth birthday than the Centennial Exposition held in Philadelphia.  So, too, the Columbian stamps<unclear reason="covered"/> these have little apparent connection with the city of Chicago and the great fair that was held there in 1893.  Not one of their designs in the remotest way suggests the great metropolis of Lake Michigan or its surrounding territory; these all cluster around the one historical event of four hundred years before, the discovery of America.</p>
                            <p>But the Omaha stamps neither celebrate a national birthday nor any one specific event of the past; they primarily advertise the great fair now being held at Omaha, with that city and the country by which it is surrounded.  Thus in the truest sense they strike out into an entirely new field.  The Omahas are as truly a new departure for the government as were the centennial envelopes in 1876, and far more truly so than were the Columbians, which were but a fuller development of the idea first exploited by these earlier stamps.</p>
                            <p>Everyone must allow, whatever criticisms may be passed upon the Omahas, that they are the most thoroughly American in design of all the stamps that the government has so far issued.  The Columbians, beautiful as they are, have in their designs no more apparent connection with the United States than with that of any other country of the Western Hemisphere, from Canada to Argentina.</p>
                            <p>But how beautifully the specially drawn designs of the Omahas bring up before the imagination all the history of the great northwest, and the most characteristic things that belong to its everyday life!  For the past there are Marquette, Fremont, the Indian, the buffalo and the plainsman; for the present there are the representations of the agricultural pursuits and commerce which have already rendered the section rich and prosperous.  All is characteristic and forms, we think, the truest postage stamp commemoration that any government has yet given.</p>
                            <p>When one considers how few varieties of stamps after all the United States uses in proportion to the immensity of its population and greatness of its postal needs, it seems a pity that we cannot have in our stamps some of that pleasing variety that the government has shown us it is so well able to give in the case of the Omahas.</p>
                            <p>This country uses, for instance, far more stamps than all the rest of the Western Hemisphere, North, South and Central America, with the West Indies and all their countless issues and sets of stamps.  Now, even if we cannot have a set of stamps for each state&#8212;an arrangement that would still not cause us to issue nearly so many kinds of stamps in proportion to our population as the rest of the world&#8212;why would it not be well for the government more frequently to give us special emissions to add to the beauty and variety of the current set?  If such a triumph has been scored by these Trans-Mississippi stamps, one is assured of the beautiful results that might be <choice><sic>achived</sic><corr>achieved</corr></choice> in special sets for New England, the Middle States, the South, the Middle States, the South, the Mid West and the Pacific Coast, whether there were any expositions or special events to call for them or not.&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Mekeel's Weekly Stamp News</hi>, St. Louis.</p>

                            <p>After <del>nearly half a hundred</del><add>many</add> states, societies and municipalities had in turn contributed life and feature to the exposition the Bohemians of the transmississippi country came yesterday and eclipsed all previous records.  Bohemian day was the most brilliant success of all, and the biggest week that the exposition has yet enjoyed was fittingly closed by the great celebration that made it notable.</p>
                            <p>While there was an average crowd on the grounds in the morning it did not compare with that of the afternoon and evening.  A large proportion of the people remained <choice><sic>donwtown</sic><corr>downtown</corr></choice> to see the parade, and it was late in the forenoon when the real rush of visitors begun.  The parade arrived at the grounds shortly after noon, and at the same time the street railway was bringing all the people it could haul.  In half an hour the crowd was apparently doubled and fully 5,000 people came through the various gates during that time.  The parade was admitted at the wagon gate on Sherman avenue, and passed down the West Midway to Twentieth street and thence to the Administration Arch, where the floats and carriages were turned back and our of the grounds, and their occupants slighted and went on to the Auditorium, where the exercises of the day occurred.  Both sides of the Midway were packed with spectators, and the Cosmopolitan band caught the crowd with its inspiring rendition of "Semper Fidelis" march.  Each of the magnificent floats was heartily cheered, and the various uniformed societies that marched in the pageant were also given an enthusiastic greeting.  General Manager Clarkson took personal charge of the parade after it reached the grounds, and both he and the other exposition officials who were present took occasion to congratulate the Bohemian committee on its success in bringing in the biggest party and the most brilliant pageant that had yet visited the grounds.</p>

                            <p>The interval before the exercises was devoted to an attentive discussion of the numerous lunch baskets that came with the crowd and for half an hour the main court was transformed into a huge basket picnic.  The exercises at the Auditorium were on a scale that was commensurate with the general enthusiasm of the day.  The big building was packed from the pipe organ to the doors, and in spite of the heat resultant from so much crowding and the rather long program, it remained crowded to the end.  Then the people swarmed to the Plaza, where they gave equally hearty approval to a short calisthenic drill by the Bohemian turner societies of Omaha, St. Louis and Cedar Rapids.  By this time the lunch baskets were again in demand, and almost without exception the visitors remained through the evening.  They were delighted with the beautiful illuminations that most of them saw for the first time, and the fireworks display that was pulled off at 9 o'clock for their especial benefit was also liberally patronized.  Ninety per cent of the visiting Bohemians will stay in the city to the extreme limit of their return tickets and see the numerous features of the big show that they had no opportunity to inspect yesterday.</p>
                            <p>The school children's excursion from Auburn, Weeping Water and intermediate points added about 400 youngsters to the crowd.  The children arrived on the regular Missouri Pacific train shortly before 10 o'clock and were received at the north gate by Secretary Ford and other representatives of the Woman's Board of Managers.  They had been provided with tickets on the train by a representative of the Admissions department and were promptly marshaled through the gates and dismissed in groups to enjoy their holiday until 9:30 last night, when they were taken home on a special train.</p>
                            <p>With a return to the 25-cent Sunday admission the prospect for a good crowd on the grounds today is encouraging.  The attendance on previous Sundays has been a convincing argument that the people do not propose to pay half a dollar to see half a show.  Last Sunday the total attendance was 9,124, and on the preceding Sunday it aggregated only 7,204.  These small figures handicapped the attendance record materially on the first day of the week, but the management is convinced that today will record a different story.</p>

                            crowds that has yet been packed into the Auditorium and both the addresses of the various speakers and the musical features of the program were rewarded with vigorous expressions of appreciation.  Both the English and Bohemian languages were used, but through all the program there was a patriotic motive that was eloquently expressed and greeted with an enthusiasm that left no doubt of the sentiments of the audience.</p>
                            <p>It required some time to get the big crowd fairly distributed through the building.  When this was accomplished every seat was occupied and the standing room was filled to the doors.  The McCook band plated a stirring march, followed by a fantasie that elicited an encore and then Anton Kment of this city called the meeting to order with a short address in Bohemian, and introduced Mayor Moores, who received an enthusiastic greeting.  Mayor Moores expressed the pleasure it afforded him to welcome to Omaha such a representative gathering of Bohemian-American citizens.  All American citizens are foreigners, he said, if they trace their ancestry back far enough, and the Bohemians are loyal citizens of their adopted country.  They have been accustomed to work in their native country and there are no idlers among them.  In this country where no aristocracy of birth is recognized the foreign born citizen has an equal opportunity to rise to wealth and distinction.  The mayor referred to the large proportion of Bohemians in Nebraska and declared that on that account it is eminently fitting that this celebration should be held in this city.  He suggested that one of the greatest newspapers in the west, The Omaha Bee, is edited by a man who was born in Bohemia, and who is recognized as one of the brainiest and most enterprising citizens of Nebraska.  In conclusion he presented the visitors with the golden keys of the city, which were appropriately received by Mr. Kment on behalf of the Bohemian societies.</p>

                            <head type="sub">On Behalf of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Edward Rosewater welcomed the visitors in behalf of the exposition.  After the applause that followed his introduction had subsided Mr. Rosewater said that the vast audience before him reminded him forcibly of some of the scenes that had passed before him since he came to Omaha thirty-five years ago.  He was then the first Bohemian to settle in Omaha, but now the Bohemian population of the city is greater than the total population was at that time.  He briefly referred to the value of expositions as a means of developing the industries and resources of the people and emphasized the success of this exposition in the face of the discouraging conditions against which it had contended.  He expressed his pride that this celebration is the greatest event of the kind that has yet occurred on the grounds.  "I am proud of my native country," declared the speaker, "and I was never prouder of it than I am when I see this magnificent audience today."</p>
                            <p>A very enjoyable interlude in the speaking was contributed by the Svor Lyra chorus of Omaha, which sang a Bohemian song very acceptably and answered an encore with "America."</p>
                            <p>Prof. B. Sinek of the Iowa State university responded very ably to the greetings that had just been extended.  He commented on the fact that the population of this country presents a curious mixture of racial elements.  The result has been the formation of a grand national character that has combined the best qualities of the nations from which it has drawn its inspiration.  All Americans, regardless of birth, are one in their loyalty to the flag of their adopted country.  They retain a tender recollection of their native land and he declared that it was with the greatest gratification that he had just heard one of the most prominent men in Nebraska declare that he was proud that his cradle had rested on Bohemian soil.</p>
                            <p>Continuing, Prof. Simek referred to the early history of Bohemia to show that it was in that oppressed county that the first lesson of liberty had been learned, and he declared that it would yet take its proper place among the nations of the world.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">One Country, One Flag.</head>
                            <p>The Bohemians in this country are American citizens in spirit and in fact, but their loyalty to this country does not forbid them to cherish the sentiments inspired by their recollections of the history of their native land.  These tendencies are not dangerous, but are matters of sentiment that do not refer to government.  If the recent talk of differences between this country and Austria had materialized in fact the Bohemian citizens of America would have been the first to enlist to give Austria a sound drubbing.</p>
                            <p>This sentiment was received with tremendous applause, which was repeated when the speaker alluded in patriotic terms to the victories of the Spanish war.  He protested against any entanglement with a European power.  It is pleasant to think that England has been friendly to us in this struggle, but Russia was also kind to us during the civil war and France had supported us in our struggle for independence.  The Bohemians do not desire to build up a Bohemia in this country, but neither did they wish to build up a Germany, an Ireland or an England.  This must be all America, and to that end none of its citizens would contribute their energies more liberally than the Bohemians.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Joseph Humpal-Zeman of Chicago, editress of the Bohemian Journal, delivered a very interesting address in Bohemian, which was liberally punctuated by applause.  The band played a descriptive selection that was vigorously applauded and this was followed by another song in Bohemian by the chorus.  An encore was answered with "The Star Spangled Banner," which again aroused the patriotic spirit of the crowd and Chairman Kment read telegrams expressing the felicitations of Sokol Cech of Cleveland and the Old Bohemian Pilgrims of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>The concluding address was delivered by Hon. Cenek Duras of Wilbur, Neb., who expressed in Bohemian sentiments very similar to those which Prof. Sinek had so eloquently voiced in English.  Mr. Duras alluded to the history of his people as that of a race that had ever been struggling for liberty.  In the institutions of this country they found their ideal of national existence and they would <choice><sic>adways</sic><corr>always</corr></choice> be found among their most loyal and devoted supporters.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Must Not Expect Too Many Visitors from the East.</head>
                            <p>Major Wheeler of Buffalo, N. Y., the secretary of the New York state commission, in speaking of the exposition and its prospects, says:  "The Peace Jubilee ought to bring a great crowd to Omaha.  Eminent representatives of the country will be here, and it will be a great occasion which ought to be fittingly observed.</p>
                            <p>"The holding of New York day on October 8 will no doubt prove satisfactory to the people of New York, and many of them, I think, will be here.  Chauncey M. Depew will be in Chicago on October 8, and I think there will be no trouble in securing his attendance here.</p>
                            <p>"New York has the honor of being the only eastern state that has a building upon the exposition grounds.  We came 1,500 miles to accept the kind invitation of the west and we must not be judged, as a few do, by comparing our modest building with the one that we had at the World's fair held in Chicago, or with the many others here built by the transmississippi states, or those more directly interested commercially and otherwise.</p>
                            <p>"We came with some difficulty in response to many urgent requests, to show our love and affection for Omaha and our great country, and our appreciation of this exposition.  Our appropriation was made on the last day of the session of the state legislature, and after expending the sum of $10,000,000 for a canal for the benefit of the west, we had to put up $15,000,000 more to complete it; we have also spent $1,000,000 to aid in carrying on the Cuban war.  Our sons, our farmers, mechanics, clerks, dudes, and millionaires have been fighting the battles of our country, shoulder to shoulder with the western boys, and it is particularly appropriate that we at home and here should now be drawn closer together.  War has united our nation everywhere, and now at this great Peace Jubilee let us be made more fully one before accepting too hastily an Anglo-American alliance.</p>
                            <p>"This exposition is a wonderful one in many ways and successful in spite of the difficulties presenting themselves.  New York has never had a great exposition, although contributing frequently and liberally to others.  One, however, is projected in Buffalo or Niagara Falls, and I trust that the western states will be represented there in 1901.  The Transmississippi Exposition is well known in the east, especially by those who have read the leading newspapers and magazines, all of which have from time to time published long notices of its course.  Thousands have paid little attention to it; others have failed to realize its size.  But for the war, more notice would have been taken.  People here, I think, do not realize the interest that the people in the Atlantic states took in the war.</p>
                            <p>"The attendance from the east may be somewhat increased by judicious and wise advertising, but from a financial standpoint it is difficult to see the advantage to be gained by displaying expensive notices to a people who will not and cannot spare the time and money to go 1,500 miles to see even so beautiful a show as this.  One cannot come here from New York and remain a week for less than $100.  To make the trip for that sum will require the greatest economy.  <choice><sic>Continential</sic><corr>Continental</corr></choice> travelers, tourists, organized bodies attending conventions, state officials and commissioners, together with a few wealthy people seeking new <unclear reason="torn"/>body which the exposition must expect to draw from our state.  These may be and are being reached in various inexpensive ways without general advertising, which is expensive.</p>
                            <p>"Fifty thousand dollars could be easily spent in the east and the result would probably bring here 1,000 people.  Eighty per cent of the attendance at this exposition must necessarily come and should come from a radius of 400 miles of Omaha.  The men and women residing here will doubtless never see the equal of this great exposition, and they should be made to attend.</p>
                            <p>"Exhibitors tell me that if the 'head man' here, who is so numerous and difficult to find, could arrange to have the space in the newspapers now devoted to personal and official differences, given to cultivating friendship, and looking out for the comforts, convenience and interests of exhibitors, who, they say, make the exposition what it is, they would have nearly 2,000 advocates writing flattering letters to their homes and their friends, instead of as now, giving the exposition management a black eye in each letter.</p>
                            <p>"I have attended nearly every exposition in the United States, but I never saw such general and universal dissatisfaction.  The exhibitors and concessionaires are the silent partners of an exposition, and their wishes and friendship should be consulted and secured.  If necessary a special committee should wait upon them to ascertain their grievances and remedy them, if possible."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Will Advertise the Exposition When They Return Home.</head>
                            <p>A number of the residents of Louisiana are in the city visiting the exposition.  They are all delighted and will remain over next week, when they will return home to become walking advertisements for the big show.  All of the men are extensive rice planters and are here on their annual outing, which they say every wealthy farmer takes.  The party includes Mr. and Mrs. C. N. Abbott of Crowley, Mr. and Mrs. E. T. Rawson and S. J. Johnson of Jennings.  They are making their headquarters in the Louisiana section in the Agricultural building.</p>
                            <p>C. N. Abbott and E. F. Rawson formerly resided in Iowa, but went south a number of years ago.  Mr. Abbott's father was one of the pioneers of eastern Iowa, having settled at West Union as early as 1851, where he pre-empted land.  Mr. Abbott has a plantation of rice that covers 500 acres.  Mr. Rawson has 3,000 acres, while Mr. Johnson is a member of a firm that has 8,000 acres under cultivation this year.  His firm has expended $200,000 in constructing a canal to irrigate the land that it owns.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the rice culture in the south, Mr. Johnson said:  "It is becoming a great crop and is making people rich.  It is grown to a great extent by the men who have come into our state from the north.  The crop in the south is much more profitable than in the north, as one acre will produce four times as much rice as will an acre of wheat, and then an acre of rice can be handled just as cheaply as an acre of wheat.  We put it in in about the same manner as wheat, cut it with selfbinders and thresh it with an ordinary grain separator."</p>
                            <p>All of the Louisiana visitors are enthusiastic over the exposition, declaring that it is about as good as the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>Louisiana is beginning to show its fruit, some fine pears having been received.  In addition to the fruit, there is some corn that is the biggest ever seen in this country.  It stands sixteen feet high and the tassels have not commenced to appear.</p>

                            <p>The Horticulture building was visited by thousands of people yesterday, all of whom apparently took a great interest in the fruit that was on exhibition.  Most of the tables had been replenished Friday night, and yesterday morning they were as fresh and bright as it was possible to make them.</p>
                            <p>During the day Illinois came in with a lot of quinces, the first exhibited from any of the northern states.  They were sent by an editor, who, while publishing a newspaper, raises fruit as a side line and makes money.  The sender was E. G. Mendenhall, who publishes the Horticultural Visitor at Kinmundy.</p>
                            <p>The fruit growers of Oregon sent in a consignment of Bartlett pears, yellow egg plums, and Pacific prunes.  Arrangements have been made by which Oregon's fruit exhibit will be replenished three times each week from now until the close of the exposition.  The fruit will come in large quantities, and every variety grown in the state will be shown.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska exhibit received sixty baskets of peaches yesterday.  There were twenty-five <choice><sic>varities</sic><corr>varieties</corr></choice>, and when they were put in place upon the table they made a great showing.  Superintendent Youngers is out in the state looking up peaches and will return during the first of the week.  While<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>One of the leading events of the exposition will be the grand choral congress to be held September 23-26, inclusive.  All choirs who can read music and sing selections under their own leaders are invited.

                            <p>The expenses will be light, choirs paying a small rate for transportation and the Bureau of Public Comfort will secure rooms and board adjacent to the grounds at a small cost in private families.  The advantages will be a pass to the exposition good for the four days of the congress; also the use of the Auditorium and the grand organ, and the privilege of hearing the celebrated Mexican national band in four concerts, and the celebrated Innes band of New York in four.</p>

                            <p>Friday&#8212;Morning session:  Addresses by the president of the exposition, the mayor of Omaha and other prominent people, and the appointment of program and entertainment committees.  The afternoon session will consist of an organ recital, papers on musical subjects, singing by visiting choirs under their own leaders.</p>
                            <p>Saturday&#8212;Morning session:  Speeches, including a lecture on singers and singing by the eminent authority, Dr. Charles Baetens.  Afternoon session: As before, with the addition of Welsh, German and Scandinavian choirs singing in their own languages.</p>
                            <p>Sunday&#8212;Morning session:  Special musical service at the First Methodist church, congress to attend in a body and occupy reserved seats.  Afternoon session:  Opening concert by Innes' band at 4 o'clock; lecture on hymns and hymn singing with vocal illustrations by the choral congress.</p>
                            <p>Monday&#8212;Morning session:  Five minute chats.  Afternoon session: Organ recital and experience meeting, giving impressions of the congress.</p>
                            <p>There will be a rehearsal of the entire body after each afternoon session.  On each evening at 7 o'clock the entire chorus will sing in the band stand on the Grand Plaza and will be accompanied either by the Mexican or the Innes bands.  In addition to all this there will be special attractions all over the grounds for the visitors and at this particular time the exposition will be at its best.  Those who intend to avail themselves of this will please write at once to Thomas J. Kelly, superintendent Bureau of Music, Transmississippi Exposition Omaha.</p>

                            <p>Every week now establishes a new record in exposition attendance, and the seven days just closed record the biggest aggregate up to date.  Nearly 116,000 people passed through the gates during the week, or over 12,000 more than the previous week.  The increase is found in the last five days of the week, as Sunday and Monday were lighter than the corresponding days of the preceding week.  Sunday was a literal frost in point of attendance, but this was more than offset by the big crowds of the succeeding days.  Today the week begins without the handicap of a 50 cent admission on Sunday, and if the same ratio of increase is continued that has pulled for the last three weeks the next seven days will swell the aggregate by fully 130,000.  The following is the total attendance on each day of last week as compared with that of the week before:</p>

                            <head type="sub">Injunction Fails to Secure Permission to Open Its Gates.</head>
                            <p>The differences between the management of the Old Plantation and the exposition association have been taken into the courts.  Last night a deputy sheriff served a restraining order on President Wattles and other exposition officials by which they were enjoined from interfering with the operation of the concession.  The order was issued by Judge Scott.</p>
                            <p>After consultation with Attorney Montgomery President Wattles decided to let matters remain as they are for the present and consequently refused to allow the concession to open.  A threat that the matter would be again taken before Judge Scott and that the president would be in jail before midnight failed to produce the desired effect and the doors of the Old Plantation remained closed last evening.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said later in the evening that he had acted on the advice of the <unclear reason="torn"/> offered to personally secure the concessionist for any damages he may be awarded either by the courts or by arbitration on account of the fire that destroyed his theater and that if he will give him a check for the amount due the exposition he can open at once.  This suggestion was refused and President Wattles insists that the show will not be opened until it has paid the exposition the amount due according to its contract.</p>

                            <p>The Minnesota people who are showing butter in the Dairy building and who were running their own refrigerating plant have abandoned it on account of the expense and have placed their exhibit in the refrigerating cases furnished by the exposition.  They bought and paid for ice for a few days, but at last they discovered that the refrigerating plant in the building furnished a lower temperature and one that was more even and then they made the change.</p>
                            <p>Things are shaping themselves so it is probable the butter test will come on next Monday afternoon.  There is a good deal of dissatisfaction over the delay, but the exposition people contend that it is not through any fault of theirs.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska butter exhibit is being put in first-class shape and before the end of the week the big case on the north side of the building will be filled.  This is not a competitive exhibit, but is one put in just to show what the state can do in the way of turning out dairy products.  The exhibit contains creamery and dairy butter, which is put up in firkins and fancy packages.</p>

This is a substantial indication that the finances of the exposition are on a satisfactory basis and anticipate the expectation of the management.

Of the $36,189.92 issued $19,994.75 were redeemed <choice><sic>yes-today</sic><corr>yesterday</corr></choice>, almost three weeks before the time expected.

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION TRAVEL TO BE ENCOURAGED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Agreement in the Western Passenger Association Impossible and the Disruption of the Organization Naturally Follows.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Omaha passenger men came out of the two days' session in Chicago on reasonable rates to the exposition quite as well as they had expected.  It was not anticipated that any agreement in the Western Passenger association for lower rates could be reached, and the individual action of the Omaha terminal lines in announcing a very low line of rates for the months of September and October is no surprise.  It demonstrates, however, that the general passenger agents of this city, and some of those presiding over the passenger affairs of other lines entering Omaha, propose to leave no effort unmade to secure a big attendance for the exposition during its last two months.</p>
                            <p>General Passenger Agents Francis of the B. &amp; M. and Buchanan of the Elkhorn worked very hard to bring about the low rates desired by general agreement, and when they found that was impossible led the movement to put in the low rates by individual notice.  Mr. Buchanan also represented General Passenger Agent Lomax of the Union Pacific and voted his proxy in favor of the low rates.</p>
                            <p>The following schedule of reduced rates will be put into effect on Thursday next, September 1, by all lines entering the city.  The roads that have already given individual notice of their intention to participate in the rates are the Burlington, the Union Pacific, the Northwestern, the Elkhorn, the Rock Island, the Missouri Pacific, the Port Arthur Route, the Milwaukee and the Illinois Central and the rates are:</p>
                            <p>From points from which the one-way rate is not to exceed $4.50, one fare plus 10 per cent, sale every day; return limit, five days.</p>
                            <p>From points from which the regular one-way rates are $5 and not to exceed $10, one fare plus 5 per cent for the round trip, except that from west of the Missouri river a one-fare rate may be made from points from which the one-way rate does not exceed $14; on sale every day; limit, seven days.</p>
                            <p>From points beyond the $10 and $14 limit respectively, one fare plus $2, sell Tuesdays and Fridays of each week; final limit, fifteen days.</p>
                            <p>The present summer tourist rate of 80 per cent of double the one-fare for the round trip is to stand.</p>
                            <p>Connecting lines to be tendered rate of one fare plus $2 for round trip from association terminals for tickets to be sold Tuesdays of each week from September 6 to October 25, inclusive.</p>
                            <p>For Chicago day the rate to be $10 from Chicago; on sale September 30; final limit October 3.</p>
                            <p>For St. Louis day, date to be fixed, rate to be $9 from St. Louis.</p>
                            <p>McKinley day will undoubtedly require special consideration.  The final return limit on all tickets provided for as above shall in no case exceed November 3, 1898.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Effect of the Action.</head>
                            <p>The effect of the action just decided upon will be to grant about half rates from all points in the territory of the Western Passenger association during the last two months of the exposition.  One fare rates with slight additions will be offered from most points.  The $10 round trip rate from Chicago for Chicago day, October 1, proposed by General Passenger Agent Heafford of the Milwaukee, is to be put in by all lines.  In addition to the rates previously named the lines decided on a rate of 80 per cent of the one way fare for the round trip for each of these occasions: September 10, National Firemen's Tournament day; September 22, Modern Woodmen of America day.</p>
                            <p>As for the Western Passenger association, it will practically cease to exist during the next two months.  Unable to prevent the Omaha lines from granting favorable rates on account of the exposition, it will retire from the field for awhile.  As the Kansas City lines proposes to put the same rates into that city during the time the exposition rates are in effect here there will be very little need of Chairman Caldwell's attempting to hold the rates up to tariff.  It is altogether probable that the temporarily disrupted association will be reorganized after the close of the exposition.  The chief opposition of the Kansas City lines to low rates for the exposition, it is learned, is that the natural effect will be <unclear reason="torn"/> a movement of <unclear reason="torn"/>through Omaha instead of Kansas City, and during the next two months and for some time afterward give the Omaha lines a chance at the transcontinental and other through business that has previously been secured to other Missouri river gateways.</p>

                            <p>Speaking of the exposition, Secretary Chase of the Iowa commission, said:  "It is a pronounced success, second in beauty and size to the World's fair, held in Chicago in 1893.  All Iowa people will desire to visit the exposition before it is closed and there is no better time to come than during September.</p>
                            <p>"The Iowa commission has selected September 21 as Iowa day, and during that week it is expected that the railroads will make the very low rate of 1 cent per mile from all parts of the state.  As Iowa is the first in importance of the transmississippi states, and as the exposition is held upon the bluffs overlooking Iowa soil, at our immediate western boundary, Iowa day should be and will be the greatest day in point of attendance of any of the state days.</p>
                            <p>"In order to make Iowa day at the exposition the grandest of all state days that will be held during the months of September and October, the Iowa commission has decided to appeal to the state and local pride of the various cities and towns and counties in the state to assist in making it the great event that it should be.  Eminent speakers are on the program for the occasion, among them being Governor Leslie M. Shaw and Congressman Robert G. Cousins.  Many cities and towns have already signified their intention of getting up special excursions, accompanied by good bands from their immediate localities, and come prepared to make the Iowa day parade a magnificent affair.  The parade will consist of the Iowa Crocker brigade, a cavalry company from Des Moines, the governor and his staff and the state officials, United States senators and representatives, ex-governors, ex-senators of the state and the marching organizations from the various counties.  Assurances are at hand indicating that fifteen uniformed bands will be in the procession, and we hope to increase this number to fifty.  The Iowa building, with its large and shady porches and its numerous easy chairs and other conveniences, will be at the disposal of all and all are cordially invited to make the building their headquarters and resting place while at the exposition."</p>

                            <p>The American Forestry association will hold an important meeting in Omaha on Friday and Saturday, September 9 and 10.  This meeting is held in accordance with a vote of the association at its meeting, held at Nashville a year ago, and it was contemplated at that time that this meeting should be largely devoted to topics relating to the west, it has, also been arranged that a number of western men of many years' experience in the west shall be placed upon the program, so that the "Great Treeless District" may have thorough representation.</p>
                            <p>Some of the topics that will be treated are as follows:  "Where Does Our Timber Come From;" "The Wind Break&#8212;Its Value and Form;" "Conifers on the Plain;" "The Catalpa in Plantations;" "The Inspection of Native Forest Growth in the Plains;" "How Does Forest Growth Effect Climate;" "The Forest Botany of Nebraska, Economically Considered;" Arbor Day and Its Economic Significance."</p>
                            <p>Some of the well known persons who will take part in the meeting by presenting papers are:  Hon. J. Sterling Morton, Dr. George L. Miller, Hon. R. W. Furnas, E. F. Stephens, C. A. Keffer, C. L. Watrous, F. S. Phoenix, Henry Michaelson, S. M. Emery, George Van Houten, C. S. Harrison, Prof. Charles E. Bessey, B. E. Fernow, Prof. Lawrence Bruner and George E. Kesser.</p>
                            <p>The exact topics assigned to each speaker will be announced a little later, but, in the mean time, it may be understood that it is proposed to have a thoroughly profitable program made up from the topics, which will have the most interest to those who are likely to be in attendance  The low rates on the railroad at this time will make it possible for many to attend this meeting, who could, perhaps, not otherwise come.</p>
                            <p>The exact place of meeting in Omaha will be announced in due season.  Persons interested, or desirous of any further information, are cordially invited to correspond with F. W. Taylor, superintendent Agriculture and Horticulture, Transmississippi Exposition, Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The officers are:  Hon. Francis H. Appleton, president, Boston; George F. Whittlesey, recording secretary and treasurer, Washington.</p>

                            <p>Shriner day at the exposition, which will be celebrated September 14, promises to be an eventful occasion for the members of that ancient order and their friends.  The arrangements are in the hands of Tangier and Sesotris temples and nothing will be lacking that can add to the enjoyment of their guests.  The headquarters of the Shriners on the grounds will be at the Auditorium, which has been reserved for their exclusive use and the celebration will begin in the Auditorium at 10 o'clock with a general reception which will continue for one hour.  At 11 o'clock the visiting Masons will be formally welcomed to the exposition and badges and souvenirs will be distributed.  At 2 o'clock there will be a special shrine concert in the Auditorium, at which an elaborate program will be rendered and receptions will be held in their honor at the various state buildings from 3 to 5 o'clock.  At 6:30 there will be a grand Midway parade in which all the Orientals, with their camels and bands will participate, and at 9 o'clock there will be a special fire works display, which will include a number of set pieces peculiarly appropriate to the occasion.  After the fireworks the Shriners will descend on the Midway in force and a number of special entertainments will be given in their honor.</p>

                            <p>A letter from J. E. Gunckel, passenger agent of the Lake Shore road at Toledo, O., to The Bee, states that about 200 people from the northern part of Ohio are preparing to visit the exposition to help celebrate Ohio day, October 5.  Of these about 150 people will come from Toledo alone.  The Toledo citizens want to have a day of their own, and if New York day is postponed from October 6 to October 8, the Toledo folks will ask for October 6 for themselves.  The governor of Ohio and his entire staff will accompany the party.  A special train will leave Toledo on Tuesday morning, October 4, returning there on the following Saturday.  A rate of $32 for the round trip to include everything has been secured for the party.</p>

                            <p>The hotel men of the transmississippi region will celebrate tomorrow as their special day at the exposition.  Monday, August 29, was some time ago set aside for the keepers of hostelries west of the Mississippi river and the indications are that there will be a big number in attendance.  Over 7,000 invitations have been issued, one being sent to every hotel man in the territory represented by the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Coates of the Mercer hotel yesterday announced that a program had been prepared covering entertainment for the visitors for three days.  Nothing is planned for Monday morning, that time being allowed the hotel men to arrive and get located.  The exercises will open at the Auditorium on the exposition grounds on Monday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.  There will be music by one of the exposition bands and Mayor Frank E. Moores will extend a cordial welcome on behalf of the city.  He will be followed by President Gurdon Wattles, who will speak on behalf of the exposition directory.  Ralph Kitchen, president of the Hotel Men's association of Omaha, will reply to the addresses of welcome and then the visitors will devote the remainder of the afternoon and evening to viewing the exposition.</p>
                            <p>On Tuesday morning at 8:30 o'clock the hotel men will assemble at Fourteenth and Harney streets.  There they will board a train of special trolley cars and go to South Omaha.  The entire morning will be put in there in inspecting the packing plant of Armour &amp; Co. and at noon the hotel men will be the guests of the Armour people at luncheon.  The remainder of the day and evening will be spent at the exposition.  On Wednesday there will be another trolley excursion about town for the hotel men and in the evening there will be a theater party in their honor.</p>

                            <p>Vigorous efforts are being made to make Pennsylvania day at the exposition, October 5, one of the leading state days of the series.  Omaha people who have the Keystone state as their place of nativity have enlisted the active support of those who live elsewhere in the transmississippi region and together they promise to make a creditable showing for their state.  The time selected will be in the same week with the Ak-Sar-Ben annual festivities and that fact is being made use of to bring the Pennsylvanians out to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The details of the program for the day have not yet been arranged, but they will be worked out later by the managers of the exposition and the state commission.  Governor Hastings of Pennsylvania will be present and will respond to the welcome extended by the transmississippi states and Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith will make the address of the day.  There will also be special music.</p>
                            <p>In order the better to gather the children of the Keystone state in Omaha on that date Pennsylvania clubs have been organized in this city and throughout the transmississippi region, which will bring the people interested in touch with this movement and arouse within them an interest in the day and a desire to be present at the celebration.</p>
                            <p>To make the gathering more like the harvest home festivals so familiar in Pennsylvania years ago, the local clubs are arranging for a big basket picnic to be held at Hanscom park on October 6, the day after the state celebration.  Here the time will be devoted to short speeches, reminiscences, story telling and the forming of new acquaintances and the renewing of old ones.  Five thousand button badges have been ordered as souvenirs of the day and the local committee expects to have the supply exhausted before all the Pennsylvanians present shall be served.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THE Z5-CENT RATE.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Omaha, Aug. 27.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: The people will now be admitted to the exposition during Sunday afternoon and evening for 25 cents; also on Monday evening and Thursday evening after 6 o'clock at 25 cents.  Please call attention to the fact that some of the directors have constantly been in favor of low rates for the special benefit of those who cannot attend during the week days had appreciated the benefit put at their disposal in a 25-cent Sunday rate then we would have had these rates almost ever since the opening of the exposition, and in what other way could our working people have found so much delightful relaxation and recreation?  You ought to impress upon them that the continuation of this reduced rate depends upon whether they themselves want it, for if the attendance either on Sunday or on Monday and Thursday evening is meager and unsatisfactory then the chances are that the board of directors will decide to go back to the full rate of 50 cents.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me as if our laboring people, with their families, would be glad to avail themselves of this wonderful opportunity for healthy and instructive enjoyment; and it seems to me, further, as if many who were in no other way able to contribute to the success of the exposition would be glad to do so in this way.</p>
                            <p>Many of our people who can otherwise afford to pay 50 cents should also attend, so as to encourage the exposition, and they will find not only in the exposition itself, but in the happy faces of the fellow citizens a source of much enjoyment.</p>
                            <signed>THOMAS KILPATRICK.</signed>

                            <p>The exposition directors have acted wisely in definitely settling upon the admission rate of 25 cents for Sunday, and have also acted wisely and for the good of the exposition in fixing upon a 25 cents admission rate for Monday and Thursday evenings.</p>
                            <p>By this action the directors have made it possible for all to visit the exposition and secure a share of its benefits at a cost too small to be considered in comparison with the benefits.  The World-Herald has been an advocate of the 25 cents rate for two months, and it is convinced that it will be profitable alike to the exposition and to the people.  The men and women who can ill afford to lose a working day are now enabled to secure the benefits of the exposition without losing their working time or being forced to pay more than others of greater leisure in proportion to the time spent at the exposition.  Mr. Kilpatrick's letter hits upon the vital points of this question, and the World-Herald commends <unclear reason="torn"/> to its readers.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Most Imposing Procession That Has Entered the White City.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The parade reached the grounds at noon, and the sound of music and the glitter of floats soon thronged the bluffs tract.</p>
                            <p>The marching part of the procession entered at the Horticulture gate.  The floats and carriages entered at the wagon gate.  The width of the latter had not been well taken into account, and some of the floats were found too broad and had to stay outside.</p>
                            <p>The procession was met at the gates by General Manager Clarkson and almost the whole force of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>It was the most imposing procession that the exposition has yet seen.  The line of march was up the bluffs tract and north and west through the whole course of the Midway and down to the Administration arch.  From there the foot divisions passed on to the Auditorium, where they disbanded for dinner.  The floats and carriages turned back at the arch.</p>
                            <p>When the head of the procession reached the arch the tail was still far down on the bluff tract.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">AT THE AUDITORIUM.</head>
                            <p>The Bohemian day exercises were held in the Auditorium at 2:30.  The building was full and the audience enthusiastic.  Anton Kment, chairman of the local committee, presided, and, after several selections by the McCook band, delivered a short preliminary address in the Bohemian language, introducing Mayor Moores, who spoke words of welcome on behalf of the city.</p>
                            <p>He said it gave him always much pleasure to meet with foreign-born citizens because America offered more opportunities to the immigrant than any other country in the world.  America appreciated the Bohemian and he was sure the Bohemian appreciate America.  The Bohemian was in America an industrious, law-abiding and loyal citizen.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores thought it most appropriate that Omaha had been chosen as the place of this great Bohemian meeting, for Nebraska was the home of more Bohemians than any other state in the union save Illinois.  The mayor concluded with presenting the keys of the city to the visitors.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">ROSEWATER INTRODUCED.</head>
                            <p>In introducing Mr. Rosewater, Mr. Kment said that the address would be in English, because Rosewater had forgotten the Bohemian language.  Mr. Rosewater was inclined to resent this, declaring that, when mad, he could talk Bohemian so fast as to tire people out.  Mr. Rosewater told about his visit with President McKinley and then diverted the course of his address to expressing his pride in the land of his birth and the language of his parents.</p>
                            <p>A Bohemian song, sweetly sung by the Svor Lyra of this city, and followed by an encore, "America," preceded an address by Prof. B. Simek of the state university of Iowa.</p>
                            <p>The Bohemian population in the United States was but one of the many elements contributing to the complex, but distinct and grand, American character.  It was proper that the Bohemians should have a day at this great exposition, for they were the leaders in modern exposition enterprises.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">LIKE <choice><sic>LAMILY</sic><corr>FAMILY</corr></choice> REUNION.</head>
                            <p>It was a reunion when old times would be talked over and tender recollections of the fatherland fill the mind.  Bohemia, through John Huss, had taught pure religion.  Later she had taught the world war, and later still gave much to all the arts of peace.  Of this record no Bohemian could be ashamed, and more glorious than this was the example of Bohemia in keeping alive a national sentiment through long years of oppression.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">FUTURE OF BOHEMIA.</head>
                            <p>The time would come when Bohemia would again occupy that place among the nations of the world which she deserved.  In the meantime the history of the mother country could be remembered with pride.  It would not make Bohemians worse Americans to rejoice in their nationality.  It would, on the contrary, make them better American citizens, for they would realize the value of the blessings of liberty and the sacrifices that liberty required.  People who condemned this sentiment were the very ones who talked about an alliance between this country and England; but England, he declared, was no model for America to follow.  <choice><sic>Engyand's</sic><corr>England's</corr></choice> national conduct had never been dictated by national conscience.  In great contrast were the natives in war and peace of America, the Bohemian's adopted country, and America could not afford to bind herself to England.</p>
                            <p>It was not the desire of the Bohemians to build up a little Bohemia in America.  What they wanted was to be Americans, and to this end all their efforts would contribute.</p>
                            <p>The next address was by Mrs. Joseph Humpel Zelman of Chicago, editor of the Bohemian Ladies' Journal.  Her remarks were in the Bohemian language.</p>
                            <p>After a selection by the chorus the concluding address, in Bohemian, was delivered by Clark Duras of Wilbur, and the program closed with "The Star Spangled Banner" by the Svor Lyra.</p>

                            <p>This swells the total admissions receipts to $273,046.75, exclusive of the purchase price of the communication books, which are as yet only partially used, amounting to about $40,000.</p>
                            <p>The receipts at the special concerts and other special features held at the Auditorium thus far have been $2,634.75.  It will be observed that as a money maker for the exposition the Auditorium paid concerts have not been a success.  Every effort that has been made to make them so has been a failure, and has increased the balance on the wrong side of the ledger.  They have been probably worth the money charged, but they did not harmonize with the exposition itself, as visitors to the big show were not in a mood to sit out an oratorio or enjoy a symphony with the Midway strains breaking in at irregular intervals.  For this reason the management has abandoned the attempt to make the public like a feature that they do not receive warmly, and is striving instead to give them something that they do fancy.</p>

                            <p>The Ohio commission is pushing its arrangements for the celebration of Ohio Centennial day at the exposition October 5.  The Toledo chamber of commerce will be here in a body, and the Buckeyes propose to make it a notable occasion.  A round trip rate of $26 has been secured, which is the lowest long haul rate that has been secured by any visiting delegation.  It was worked through from the other end without the manipulation of people at this end of the line.</p>
                            <p>An extra number on the program for today will be the concert by the McCook band at the Auditorium at 4 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee yesterday decided that there would be no battle of confetti on the Grand Court next Friday evening, on the occasion of the masque carnival.  The ladies have been advertising this feature, but the members of the executive committee made up their minds that the stuff was a nuisance and that none of it would be allowed on the Court.  The buildings and grounds department was given authority to purchase 3,000 Japanese lanterns to be used on the Court on that occasion.</p>

                            move in closing up the concession.  An injunction against the exposition was issued yesterday by Judge Scott, and served on President Wattles, enjoining any further interference in the matter, and setting the time of hearing for September 17.  The matter was briefly considered at the meeting of the executive committee yesterday afternoon, and the entire situation was turned over to President Wattles.  It was stated late last evening that the exposition would stand pat in the matter, and would deny the right of the court to interfere in the case.</p>
                            <p>In June, when Secretary Wakefield was requiring contractors and exposition creditors to take a part of payments due them in exposition warrants, in compliance with the order of the board of directors, he was asked to say when the warrants would be redeemed.  While making no guarantee he expressed his belief that prior to September 15 the redemption of the exposition warrants would begin, and it was with a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction that he yesterday handed out vouchers for redemption of a portion of the issue of warrants, which had been issued for a total amount of $36,189.92.  More than one-half of the total issue, or $19,994.75, were redeemed yesterday, leaving a balance outstanding of $16,195.17.</p>
                            <p>These warrants bear interest at 7 per cent from date and are payable when "funds are in the treasury available for such purposes."</p>
                            <p>No further payment of warrants will be made until after September 1.  They will probably be all called in for payment prior to September 10.</p>

                            <p>William Cook, a South Omaha young man, was arrested yesterday for stealing a number of articles from the International building.  It is stated that he has made a practice of nipping trinkets there and selling them in the Indian camp.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday's paid attendance was 12,482, and the gate receipts for the day $5,801.25.  The total admissions were 17,751.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the department of publicity and promotion returned home yesterday, having been advised by long-distance telephone that a pass had been ordered issued to the Omaha Excelsior, contrary to his oft-expressed desires.  The pass had been sent out, however, under cover of one of Uncle Sam's postage stamps, before Mr. Rosewater could reach the bureau of admissions and countermand the order of the board of directors.  In view of the heavy penalty imposed for monkeying with the United States mails, it is uncertain whether Mr. Rosewater will try to hold up the Farnam street mail carrier or will wait until he is postmaster general before finally adjusting the matter.</p>
                            <p>Major John M. Burke, general manager of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, and Colonel Alexander Majors, the famous government freighter, were on the grounds yesterday.  Colonel Majors is 84 years of age, and is a prominent character in the history of the frontier.  Both were surprised at the size and beauty of the exposition, and were at a loss to understand why such an enterprise could exist and the people of the country know so little about it.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The 25-cent rate continues to win whenever put into operation.  It was in force at the gates yesterday, and the gate receipts for the day were $1,927.10., which, with the exception of two weeks ago, was the largest of any Sunday since July 3.  Of the thirteen Sundays that have passed since the opening of the exposition yesterday ranked fifth, and the indications are that when the concessions' percentages are in it will rank third.  The paid admissions for the day were 7,739, and the total attendance were 11,803.  The total admissions <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>The most important arrest that has been made on the grounds was made last evening, when Conductor Walker of the Hanscom park line recognized the "tall man" of the pair of highwaymen who held up his car Thursday night near Sheely, and called on Guard Powers to arrest him.  The guard took the man in tow and turned him over to Detectives Dunn and Cormack.  At the station the conductor was most emphatic in his identification, and in addressing the suspected robber, said:  "That is just the way you looked at me the other night."</p>
                            <p>The prisoner's appearance tallied exactly with the description previously given by the victims, and the conductor said he was dressed in the same clothes as at the time of the robbery.  Two dirty white handkerchiefs were found in his pockets, and the officers asked Walker if he was not mistaken about the mask having been a red handkerchief.  He was positive about the red bandana, and presently a red bandana was fished out of the prisoner's pocket.  Two opposite ends showed evidence of having been tied in a knot.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HIGHWAYMAN FROM SOUTH.</head>
                            <p>The prisoner gave the name of Joseph S. Kirby and said that he arrived in the city last Sunday and had been employed since Monday in the store room of the Markel Catering company on the grounds.  When asked to give an account of himself he said that he was from South Carolina; that he came here in May and remained about a month, being employed on the lagoon at the time the repairs were being made after the walls caved in; that he left here and went to Denver, thence to Topeka, thence out through Kansas, then to Kansas City, then to Minnesota, then to South Dakota, where he worked in the hay fields, and then back to Omaha.  His appearance was not that of a farm hand.  He was noticeably nervous when first arrested, but soon recovered his composure.</p>
                            <p>Kirby speaks with a pronounced southern dialect, and Walker had spoken of this peculiarity in giving his original description of the robber.  As soon as he heard him speak last night he was even more positive than before that the right man was under arrest.</p>
                            <p>It will be remembered that the robber's mask slipped from his face while he was going through Walker's pockets, and the latter secured a good view of his features.  Motorman Hansen, who was the other victim, was notified to visit the station and see if he could also identify the prisoner.  Hansen told the robber as he was leaving the car that he would be able to recognize him in twenty years.</p>
                            <p>Kirby is six feet and three inches in height, and his unusual stature, piercing dark eyes, brown clothes, white slouch hat and freckled face had all been previously described by Walker.  The police are positive that he is the man wanted.</p>

                            <p>The presence in the city the past few days of Lieutenant Walter Volkmar has interested the exposition officials considerably in trying to have him detailed for service here in connection with the war balloon.  He was connected with the signal corps at Santiago, and is credited with having saved the balloon after it was fired upon by the Spaniards.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that Major H. C. Ward, who is chairman of the government board and in charge of the federal exhibit here, will also use his influence in this direction, as Volkmar served under him at Nashville while a sergeant in the regular army and connected with the signal corps.  Volkmar has now been <choice><sic>transfered</sic><corr>transferred</corr></choice> to the artillery arm, and promoted to a first lieutenancy.  His visit here was due to a recuperative trip, as he landed from one of the pest ships used in transferring the troops north a very sick man, and was looked up by his uncle and nursed to partial health, after which they started on a trip along the lakes and thus arrived at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The father of the young lieutenant, Colonel Volkmar, who is on duty at Denver at the headquarters of the department of Colorado, was wired to meet his son here, and the meeting was an affecting one.  Both have now proceeded to Denver, where Lieutenant Volkmar expects to spend the remainder of his furlough.</p>

                            <p>The bringing of the balloon here in the near future will be but the delayed carrying out of the original plans of Major Ward, as he had made all arrangements for having the monster airship here prior to the breaking out of the war, and this was but one of the features that was interfered with on that account.  As soon as there were any prospects of peace, Major Ward journeyed back to Washington, and speedily completed arrangements for securing not only the balloon, but a lot of war trophies and arms of various kinds, while Commander Stedman of the navy section also arranged to secure some rapid-fire guns and the breech block mechanism of the thirteen-inch gun which have already been installed in that department at the Government building.</p>
                            <p>So far as having the identical Santiago balloon is concerned, some doubt is expressed by the officials at the Government building, but it is stated that if it cannot be put in working order there will be another just like it.  The officers say that about two or three acres of ground will be required for it, as it will be necessary to keep it removed from any danger of fire, either through cigarette smokers or otherwise.</p>
                            <p>Prof. James Mooney left the city last night on his trip to the southwest, where he goes to secure additions to the Indian aggregation in Captain Mercer's camp.  He consulted while here with Captain Mercer and the exposition officials, and every assistance was promised him.  Prof. Mooney is well acquainted with the tribes in the southwest, and it is stated that he will be able to add much of interest to the collection of aboriginal humanity to the Indian camp.  He expects to be back here about the last of Sep-</p>

                            <p>The dental faculty meeting closes this afternoon and Tuesday the National Dental association will convene at Creighton Medical college.  The meeting of dental faculties has been a good one, those comprising it being men of national reputation for learning.  Every one of the dental colleges of any consequence in the United States is represented by one or more of its teachers.</p>
                            <p>The meeting that convenes Tuesday will be a large one and many noted men will be in attendance.  At least 200 delegates are now in the city and others will come today.  Every part of the country is represented and almost every state in the union will have delegates in the body.</p>
                            <p>The association was organized in 1859 at Niagara Falls, and has grown steadily each year in membership.</p>
                            <p>The national officers are:  President, Thomas Filebrown of Boston, who arrived in the city during the last week; eastern vice president, James McManus of Hartford, Conn.; western vice president, L.

                            <p>Hotel men of the Trans-Mississippi states will have right of way today.  This is their day, and the prospects are that a large number of landlords will be here to see the sights and enjoy the good things in store for them.  They will meet at the Auditorium at 2:30 this afternoon, where the usual ceremonies will take place, and, after they have been presented with the keys, they will run at large, going where fancy suggests, and have a general good time.  Later follow lunches, theater parties and good things at every turn.</p>

                            <p>The Trans-Mississippi conference of charities and correction will be held September 15 to 20, and will be one of the most important conventions during the exposition.  The practical problems of charity and philanthropy will be discussed by the ablest men and women of the country.  Ten or twelve leaders of the National Conference of Charities and Correction will be present and assist all the way through.  All phases of local charities will also be presented.  The philanthropic and Christian people of Omaha and vicinity should not fail to be present.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Omaha, Aug. 27.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald:  I have a suggestion to offer to the exposition managers and the Omaha business houses in regard to advertising the Trans-Mississippi exposition:</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;Name and select a day (immediately) to be known as Omaha business men's Trans-Mississippi advertising day (or some similar name.)</p>
                            <p>Second&#8212;For that day the Trans-Mississippi Exposition association publicity department shall fold together, in a suitable manner for six and one-half envelope, advertising literature concerning the exposition to not exceed weight of 2-cent stamp.</p>
                            <p>Third&#8212;Get the name of every business firm in Omaha who will address and mail on their own envelopes to the correspondents east of the Missouri river and send them on one day.</p>
                            <p>Fourth&#8212;The Trans-Mississippi Exposition association to call at each business office for the mail on this advertising day and they can ascertain how many letters have been mailed.</p>
                            <p>The above is only an outline of what the exposition managers can fix, the details that would make the day the biggest advertising day for Omaha.  Let wholesale houses, retail stores, banks, hotels and other lines unite, and it will be a great advertising help for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Placing the advertising matter in each firm's own envelopes, the letters will not go to the waste basket.  The exact number of letters mailed can be ascertained, and I believe our people will assist.</p>
                            <p>Hoping that some good may come of the above suggestions, I am, believe me, forever for Omaha,</p>
                            <signed>C. O. LOBECK.</signed>

                            <p>Mr. Lobeck makes a good suggestion, and the World-Herald believes that the exposition management should promptly act upon it.  Some changes in detail might be made and by a united effort it is very certain that the result will be of great advantage to the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The South Side Improvement club, with its usual foresight and energy, has appointed a committee to negotiate for the Minnesota building for use in Riverview park.  The unique design and artistic equipment of the Minnesota building and furniture have been admired by every visitor to the exposition.  It is one of the most substantial buildings on the grounds.  Constructed of logs from Minnesota forests and stone from her quarries, if obtained, it will commemorate in one of our most popular parks the generous assistance which the people of Minnesota have rendered to the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>

                            <p>The hotel men of the transmississippi country are the guests of the exposition today and "the best in the house" is everywhere in demand.  The bonifaces are receiving the welcome of the city and of the exposition at the Auditorium this afternoon and they will spend several days in digesting the attractions of the show.  They found the exposition looking its best and a good Monday crowd that encourages the expectation that the week will register a still greater increase in the attendance.  The large proportion of new faces in the crowd indicates that the week opens with rather more than the usual influx of new visitors and these are almost exclusively people who come purely to study the exposition regardless <choice><sic>af</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> the special features that will bring large additions during the week.</p>
                            <p>It was decidedly refreshing to see a good Sunday crowd on the grounds yesterday after the successive "frosts" that had accompanied the efforts of the management to induce people to come out and spend 50 cents to see half what they could see for the same price on any other day of the week.  The effect of the reduced admission was apparent in an hour after the gates were opened and instead of the sepulchral and deserted scene that prevailed on 50-cent Sundays there was a lively and continually increasing crowd that made the enclosure look like an exposition.  While the crowd did not approximate the big attendance of the preceding days, it was exceptionally big for Sunday.  The amusement resorts that were almost absolutely deserted a week ago enjoyed quite a lively business and the bands played to good audiences instead of empty seats.</p>
                            <p>The attractions of the day were entirely of a musical character, but three excellent concerts by two bands furnished ample opportunity for enjoyment.  The Mexican band played to a big audience in front of the Government building at 2:30 and this was scarcely over before the concert by the McCook band in the Auditorium took its turn in entertaining the crowd.  The evening concert on the Plaza was enjoyed by a still larger crowd, as a great many of the Bohemian visitors who were occupied at Turner Park during the day came out in the evening to get another glimpse of the exposition by electric light.</p>
                            <p>It is noticeable that the tendency of the crowds to linger exclusively in the main court and on the bluff tract is gradually disappearing as the people learn that these do not represent the whole show.  The Indian encampment and the North Side buildings now draw their fair proportion of the visitors, and the number of people who travel a quarter of a mile to see the Indians indicates how popular the feature would <choice><sic>became</sic><corr>become</corr></choice> if a more convenient route were provided.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has now received communications from nearly all the transmississippi governors, inclosing formal invitations to President McKinley to become the guest of the exposition during Jubilee week.  These will all be presented to the president by the special committee that will call on him September 3, and they represent the hearty wishes of the people of the entire transmississippi territory as expressed through their various executives.  No new details have been announced relative to the various celebrations that will occupy Jubilee week, but the exposition officials are giving a large part of their attention to this sub-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Visit the Apiary Building and You Will Learn.</head>
                            <p>Although not so attractive upon the outside as some of the magnificent structures upon the Grand Court, the Apiary building on North Twentieth street, directly opposite the Transportation building, daily draws a crowd of people who are interested in the workings of the honey bee and bee culture generally.  The exhibit is now completely installed and is carefully looked after by Superintendent Whitcomb of Friend, this state, who is looked upon as authority when the questions relative to bees and honey come up for consideration.</p>
                            <p>For a long time after the opening of the exposition the Apiary building was practically tenantless, not because there were not exhibitors who would show their wares, but because the honey crop was not ready to be placed upon exhibition.  About two weeks ago, however, the honey crop commenced to mature and since that time the building has been filling, until now every foot of space is occupied, even to that in the gallery on the second floor.  The states of Nebraska, Kansas, Utah, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa are represented in the Apiary building, while Douglas county has an exhibit that nearly fills the cases on the south side.</p>
                            <p>The honey is principally of the present season's crop and about all of it was made since the middle of last May.  It is shown in jars, bottles, glass cans and in the comb.  In addition to the honey there are all of the appliances used in the cultivation of bees, together with hives and the machinery necessary for the work of caring for the honey.  The honey that is shown is principally from the bloom of the basswood tree, alfalfa, white and red clover, buckwheat, dandelion and heartsease.  In color it runs from a reddish brown to transparency.</p>
                            <p>The evolution of the methods of handling bees forms an interesting study, not only to those who are in the business, but to the novice, who knows that bees make honey, but how and why he cannot tell.  To show the evolution Superintendent Whitcomb has secured a lot of hives, both ancient and modern.  The oldest thing is this line is a "bee gum," which is a section of a log filled with honey and comb.  This exhibit does not antedate the flood, but the time of its existence is somewhat shrouded in mystery, as few men of this generation have seen <unclear reason="covered"/> the bee chamber, or brood room.  This is the place where the bees live and is entered from a small aperture at the bottom of the hive.  This living room is filled with hanging frames, in which the bees have constructed comb, which they have filled with honey which they use for their sustenance.</p>
                            <p>Above this is the apartment where the commercial honey is manufactured.  This is a box-like space and inside it are placed the little frames which are ordinarily sold at the grocery store, but when put in place they are empty, with the exception that through the center there is a thin sheet of wax, which the bees use as the foundation for the cells in which they place the honey.  When these frames are filled with honey and sealed over by the bees, they are removed and empty ones placed in their stead for the bees to fill, as the little things must have work, and if not provided with a place to deposit their honey, they will destroy that already made and go on with the work of refilling.  To make the sides of the comb even and smooth, glass is inserted against the sides of the frames and the bees work to this, pressing their backs against this and making the outside almost as smooth as the glass.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the first frost comes in the fall every bee stops work and hustles to the hive to prepare for the winter.  The open cells are sealed, and the working chamber of the hive is deserted, all removing to the brood room, where they remain until warm weather comes the following spring.</p>
                            <p>The artistic things that can be made from bee's wax are shown in several cases in the Apiary building.  Most of them are the handiwork of Mrs. Whitcomb, and are flowers, white, yellow, and various other colors.  The wax is pressed into thin sheets and then cut into the shapes desired for the leaves.  In addition, she has constructed an elephant in wax, and a cross, over which are trained vines of the same material.  The one which attracts as much attention as any is an Odd Fellows' emblem in different colored wax, though a pure white dove is admired by many.</p>
                            <p>The bee-keepers and the manufacturers of bee-keepers' supplies have put in a fine exhibit, said to be superior to that ever before seen.  It includes the machines for extracting the honey from the comb, the nets and gloves used to prevent bees from stinging when handled, and every other thing used in the bee culture.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Jaques of Minnesota, who is in charge of the Minnesota honey exhibit and who has <unclear reason="torn"/> building at the exposition is the best that he has ever seen, and that never before has he seen so much care used in the gathering and preparing honey for show.</p>

                            <p>Every day this week will be marked by one or more side issues that will be of interest to large bodies of people and assist to vary the regular program at the exposition.  Today is Transmississippi Hotel Men's day and the local committee that has the matter in hand expects the hotel men of the transmississippi region to be largely represented.  The <choice><sic>partiular</sic><corr>particular</corr></choice> celebration of the day will consist of exercises in the Auditorium this afternoon, at which the visitors will be appropriately welcomed.</p>
                            <p>Wednesday will be signalized by the attendance of the members in this locality of various Greek letter societies and by the parade of Colonel William F. Cody's Wild West show, which will occur at 11 o'clock.  Thursday will be Kansas day and the people of that state have arranged to attend in large numbers and celebrate the occasion by one of the most elaborate programs that has been offered by any of the states.  The exercises will be held at the Auditorium at 11 o'clock and will consist of addresses by Governor J. W. Leedy of Kansas, President Thomas E. Wills of the Kansas Agricultural college, Chancellor F. H. Snow of the Kansas State university, Hon. C. B. Hoffman and Hon. A. W. Smith of Kansas and by Governor Holcomb and President Wattles.  Bishop Frank W. Millspaugh of Kansas will deliver the invocation and music will be furnished by Caman's Military band of Winfield and a quartet from McPherson.  A reception will be tendered to Governor Leedy and the other Kansas state officials at the Kansas building at 4 o'clock and there will be an elaborate fireworks display in the evening.</p>
                            <p>Friday will be Peach day and hundreds of baskets of the luscious fruit will be distributed broadcast among the visitors on the grounds.  The court masquerade will also be held on Friday.  Saturday is scheduled as Editors' day and a number of parties of members of that profession are expected on the grounds.</p>

He will not return for some time, as it is his intention to make a tour of most of the counties in the state and induce as many as possible of the farmers to contribute to the exhibit.  Before returning he will confer with the North Dakota State Board of Agriculture and if possible induce the members to send a carload of the exhibits that will be shown at the state fair to be held at Grand Forks in October.</p>

The latest to arrive are squashes, sent by John Howerton of Curo, and John Baxter of Rock Island.  The squashes are whoppers and tip the scales at 101 pounds each.  Superintendent Atwater contends that these are small squashes for that state to exhibit.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Kelly of the music department will put on a new battle piece at the Plaza concerts Tuesday and Saturday evenings.  This is said to be superior to the one that was given by Phinney's band and promises to be one of the best drawing cards of the week.  It represents the civil war and the music, with the spectacular accessories, carries the audience from the beginning of the war through all the principal phases of the conflict and back to victory and peace.  This offers a limitless field for the introduction of novel and striking effects and the usual fireworks display will accompany the finale.  The piece will be put on by the McCook band, assisted by the exposition chorus.</p>

                            <p>Hereafter on Monday and Thursday nights children who visit the exposition will be charged 15 cents.  On these nights adults will be charged 25 cents.</p>
                            <p>Earnest Mattox of the Wild West Show was seriously injured by a shot from one of the guns used in the exhibitions yesterday afternoon.  A soap wad struck him on the knee cap and while the bone was not broken it was severely injured.</p>
                            <p>The paid admissions at the exposition yesterday aggregated $1,927, this sum having been exceeded on but four Sundays since the opening.

                            <p>There will be no battle of confetti in connection with the masked carnival on the grounds Friday night.  This decision was reached by the executive committee yesterday on the ground that it would be impossible to collect the small bits of colored paper, which would disfigure the main court for a week after.  By way of compensation the committee authorized the purchase of 3,000 Japanese lanterns to add to the illuminations of the grounds.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant Volkmar, one of the heroes of Santiago, was in the city yesterday and left last night for Denver, where he will remain for a few weeks recuperating and regaining his health.  The lieutenant was attached to the signal corps of the United States army and was instrumental in saving the big balloon which will be here in a few days and will be featured as one of the attractions of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Lieutenant Volkmar went into the signal service soon after the outbreak of the war with Spain and was attached to the balloon corps.  At that time he was a sergeant, but was promoted for bravery.  He was stricken with yellow fever and was sent north.  On arriving in New York he was met by an uncle, who took him up the St. Lawrence and through the Great Lakes.  At Duluth Lieutenant Volkmar telegraphed his father that he would be in Omaha and requested him that he come on and meet him here.  The meeting between father and son was witnessed by only a few intimate friends.  It was most affecting.</p>
                            <p>The exposition officials are endeavoring to have Lieutenant Volkmar placed on detached service as soon as his health will permit and come here and assist in giving exhibitions of balloon signaling as it was carried on during the recent war.  The young man served under Major Ward at Nashville, where the major had charge of the government exhibit, and as the major is acting in the same capacity here it is thought that he will favor his coming to Omaha to assist with the balloon.</p>

                            <p>Forty-one Chinese for the Lan Hing Trading company arrived in Omaha Sunday, and as the customs office had no record of such a company it would not receipt for them and they were allowed to disperse.  These Chinamen arrived at Seattle some time ago, and the collector of the port detained them and afterward deported them.  They were taken to Hong Kong, but again returned to this country, arriving at San Francisco, where they were admitted.  On their arrival here the local officials telegraphed the Treasury department for instructions, but not receiving a reply took the action mentioned.  It is said that of the 400 Chinamen originally brought to Omaha on account of the exposition, the majority of them have disappeared, and the customs officers are not disposed to accept any more without explicit instructions from Washington.  It is reported that another party of twelve is now on the road to Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Total Admissions and Money Taken in on Great Occasions.</head>
                            <p>The records of the various special days that have been celebrated during the first three months of the exposition afford some interesting information relative to the comparative profit that various departments of the show have derived on different occasions.  The wide variation between the receipts for admissions and those from concessions shows that there is a very material difference in the liberality of the various crowds as considered from the concessionist's standpoint.  Some visitors seem to have spent money freely in addition to their contribution at the gate, while others have simply walked up and down the promenades with their pocketbooks snugly disposed in their inside pockets.  July 4 still remains the big day of the show and the biggest receipts in every department belong to that day.  But this is the only day that does not show a variation in some respect.  The opening day stands next to July 4 in total attendance, total receipts and receipts from admissions, but the concessions paid slightly more money on World-Herald day.  Sioux City day presents a very curious proposition.  it ranked third in point of total attendance but only fifth in the amount of money received at the gates.  The records show that World-Herald day was the best day for the concessions in proportion to the total attendance with the exception of July 4 and Flower day was the poorest.  The second Flower day ranked third in the amount received at the gates, but there are seven other days on which more money was received from the concessions.  Kansas City day was also a very poor day for the amusement section, while on Texas day and Sioux City day the crowds were decidedly more liberal.  Indian day was also better than the average, for while it was eighth in point of attendance, it was sixth in receipts from both departments.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska very appropriately left more money on the grounds in proportion to the attendance on its state day than any other state.  Texas was a close second and Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa and Kansas followed in the order named.  Of the municipal days Des Moines day was characterized by the most liberal expenditure, with Sioux City and St. Joseph neck and neck for second place and Kansas City a bad third.  The following table shows exact figures for each of the principal days of the exposition up to this week:</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">THE DEMAND OF THE HOUR.</hi></head>
                            <p>Three months out of the five months of the exposition season will be over this week.  The concessions so far made by the railroads in the reduction of rates have been limited to territory within 250 miles of Omaha.  The more distant points have been under an embargo that makes all the advertising east of the Mississippi a waste of money and energy.</p>
                            <p>When it costs all the way from $30 to $100 in railroad fare and traveling expenses to make the round trip from the states east of the lakes few people can be expected to avail themselves of the attraction offered by what everybody who has seen it admits is the second greatest exposition ever held in this country.  The concession of a cent per mile rate on Chicago day, St. Louis day and a few other special days does not meet the demand of the exposition nor fulfill the promises made by the railway managers.</p>
                            <p>Weeks ago it was given out that a general reduction of railroad fares to the exposition would be inaugurated at least not later than September 1.  That date is upon us, but the promised reduction of long distance rates, which alone will bring visitors from the east and enable the exposition to carry out the object of its promoters to interest eastern investors in the undeveloped resources of the prolific region west of the Mississippi, is not yet in sight.</p>
                            <p>The reductions that have been announced for September apply only to three or four traffic points within a range of 500 miles from Omaha.  They are to be in effect only on given days, so that people residing beyond that distance are compelled to pay full fare from their homes to Chicago or St. Louis and time their trips to connect with the dates for which reduced rates are announced.  The one rate from Chicago and St. Louis, with $2 added, which has been granted for certain days of the week, is not a sufficient inducement for the middle class of the east, unless an arrangement is at once made for one-fare round trip rate from points east of Chicago on connecting lines.</p>
                            <p>It is for the traffic managers of the roads centering in Omaha to press the claims of the exposition with their connecting lines and if possible to force the reductions on long distance travel within the next ten days.  The announcement of reduced rates to Omaha will within itself insure for the roads all the passengers they can handle from now to the closing of the exposition gates.</p>

                            <p>For people interested in the war a visit to the Omaha exposition will be more satisfactory than a visit to Cuba.  Between the war relics, the models of the navy's men-of-war, the war balloon and all the other war features, the exposition offers a war display that cannot be beaten anywhere.</p>

                            <head type="sub">J. H. McDonald Says He Was Arrested for Resenting Brutality Toward His Wife.</head>
                            <p>Because James H. McDonald, the tailor of 214 South Fifteenth street, resented the rough manner in which an exposition guard took an untagged camera from his wife's hands on the exposition grounds Sunday afternoon he was arrested, thrown in the jail at the grounds and later taken to the city jail in the patrol wagon.  At the station the charge of disturbing the peace was made against him.</p>
                            <p>Mr. McDonald's version of the affair is that he and his wife were leaving the grounds after having spent the day taking pictures of points of interest when they were accosted by a guard who inquired if they had secured a tag for the camera.  In answer Mr. McDonald says he showed his season pass and his permit allowing him to use his camera on the grounds, but the guard was not satisfied and roughly grabbed the camera from his wife's hands.  This action was resented by McDonald in vigorous language.  As the guard was carrying the camera away Mr. McDonald demanded a receipt for the instrument, but this was refused him and when he persisted the guard turned on him with the remark: "Well, I'll just throw you in for being fresh," and arrested him.  He was kept in a cell some time before the wagon arrived.  Mr. McDonald is very indignant over the treatment he received and threatens a suit against the exposition management.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;When the Omaha exposition postage stamps were first announced it will be remembered that they created quite a storm of opposition from the postage stamp collectors, who seemed to think the new issue would be a hardship upon them by forcing them to buy high denomination stamps.  Their protests met with a prompt response that the stamps were not being issued for the benefit of the stamp collectors, but in commemoration of the progress of the west illustrated in the Transmississippi Exposition and that they did not have to collect the stamps if they did not want to.</p>
                            <p>The outcry of the postage stamp collectors was not sooner hushed than another agitation against the stamps was aroused by the fact that the design for the 1 cent stamp is a copy of a painting representing Father Marquette on the Mississippi.  The objections which were directed against this particular stamp emanated from the same source that instigated the onslaught upon the Marquette statue in the capitol at Washington, on the ground that such glorification of a Jesuit priest was entirely out of place.  Since the Omaha stamps have been put in circulation the post-office officials here have been receiving numerous letters entering protests against the Marquette design and demanding a change in the 1-cent stamp.  To all of these the Postoffice department has given the same firm answer.  The attitude of the postoffice officials in this matter is seen from the following letter written by the third assistant postmaster general in response to one of the anti-Marquette communications recently received:</p>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 13, 1898.&#8212;Sir: Yours of the 3d inst., requesting information as to why the design which appears upon the transmississippi 1-cent postage stamps was adopted, is received and contents carefully noted.</p>
                            <p>By way of preface to my answer, permit me to express regret that the "picture" is not entirely satisfactory to you, since it was a source of deep solicitude and much inquiry to select only such designs as would meet the approbation of the Postoffice department, as well as of the masses of the people whom it always seeks to please.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Object of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The object of the promoters and managers of the Transmississippi Exposition, as I understand it, is not only to give expression to a commendable pride on the part of the inhabitants west of the Mississippi river in the almost phenomenal progress of their section, but especially to demonstrate the growth, development, wealth and grandeur of the states and territories lying west of that great stream.  If I am correct in this view, perhaps you will agree with me in assuming that anything pertaining to the men who were most conspicuous and helpful in blazing the way to these sections and laying the foundations of civilization where the foot of the white man had never trod is fraught with great interest not only to the historian, but to every searcher after the truth.</p>
                            <p>From the dawn of civilization to the present day a disposition has been manifested on the part of posterity to pay great deference and honor to the names of those hardy men and women who have braved the toils and dangers of a new land to lay the foundations of the blessings and liberties which we now enjoy.  The Greeks and Romans made gods of them; our European progenitors have embalmed their memory in marble, story and song; while the recital of the noble deeds of the Pilgrim Fathers gathers interest and sanctity as the years roll by.</p>
                            <p>This, I take it, is why, during the Columbian Exposition, we put on one of our Columbian postage stamps a device showing the landing of Columbus, and in every other way did what we could to honor, not only Columbus, but every one in any honorable way connected with the discovery of the New World, although it is not named for Columbus.  You may say Marquette did not discover the Mississippi river; I answer, neither did Americus Vespucci discover America; yet, because he first visited the mainland, he enjoyed the distinction of having a continent named for him.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, Ferdinand de Soto discovered the lower part of the Mississippi river, and penetrated as far toward its source as Natchez only; but it remained as a sealed book until one hundred years later, when Marquette and Joliet, hearing from the Indians whose language they had learned that such a stream of water existed, proceeded from Michilimackinac to the headwaters of the Fox river, thence by portage into the Wisconsin, and descended that stream to its confluence with the Mississippi in 1673, thence thoroughly exploring it as far south as the mouth of the Arkansas.</p>
                            <p>These facts, it seems to me, are fully sufficient to justify the selection of the "picture" you condemn.</p>

                            <p>As to the religious belief of Marquette, it never entered into or influenced the selection of the device one way or the other.</p>
                            <p>The constitution of the United States, that palladium of our liberties, guarantees to all men the privilege and right of worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and I would hesitate a long time before I would discriminate against any man, other things being equal, because he differed from me in his religious belief or mode of worshiping Almighty God.</p>
                            <p>As to the face of Marquette being a foreigner, I apprehend he performed services enough as a pioneer to earn his citizenship; and his bones still lie buried in the virgin soil on the west shore of Lake Michigan.  Columbus was also a foreigner, for that matter.  Very respectfully,</p>

                            <p>A number of people have inquired as to whether or not dressing rooms will be provided on the exposition grounds Friday evening, in which costumes may be put on or arranged.  Mrs. Clement Chase says that a room in the Auditorium will be set apart for the ladies for this purpose, and another for the gentlemen, but she suggests that as many as can do so, arrange their toilettes at home, to prevent too much confusion.  Two ladies will be in charge at the ladies' dressing room.</p>
                            <p>A meeting of the Missouri state board of agriculture will be held today in the Agriculture building or Administration Arch, when additions to the Missouri exhibit will be discussed.  One of the members of the board is Norman J. Coleman, secretary of agriculture under Cleveland’s first administration, and the first secretary of agriculture.  He came to the city yesterday.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee Headed by Senator Thurston Will Call at White House.</head>
                            <p>President McKinley is to receive a formal invitation to attend the Trans-Mississippi exposition during the peace jubilee.  For this purpose President Wattles yesterday appointed a committee of distinguished citizens of Omaha.  Those who will have the honor of extending this formal invitation are Senator John M. Thurston, chairman; Congressman David Mercer, Hon. John L. Webster, Hon. J. C. Wharton and General John C. Cowin.</p>
                            <p>These gentlemen met late yesterday afternoon in the office of Mr. Wharton and discussed their mission.  Senator Thurston, who had just returned from Idaho, was very pale and apparently quite unwell, as the result of a recent operation of an extremely weakening character.  His western trip, however, did him much good, and he is rapidly regaining strength.</p>
                            <p>The entire committee will leave Omaha either next Wednesday or Thursday.  The precise date depends upon the answer to a telegram sent to Secretary J. Addison Porter after the meeting.  It was as follows:</p>
                            <p>"A delegation of representative citizens <choice><sic>acompanied</sic><corr>accompanied</corr></choice> by myself, would appreciate an interview with the president either last of this week or beginning of next to tender to him an official invitation to visit the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  Can it be arranged?  Answer.</p>
                            <ab>"JOHN M. THURSTON."</ab>
                            <p>All members of the committee desire to see the president Saturday upon his return from Somerset, Pa.  If this can be <choice><sic>aranged</sic><corr>arranged</corr></choice> they will leave the city Wednesday.  On Friday they wish to call upon the members of the cabinet and upon the diplomatic representatives of all foreign power in order to extend to them invitations to visit the exposition and to take part in the peace jubilee.  As a member of the exposition directory John L. Webster will be responsible for the delivery of the invitations to the president and others.  Senator Thurston is chairman of the committee.  Colonel Edward C. Snyder, private secretary to the senator, will accompany the committee to Washington and return to Omaha when the committee's work has been concluded.  The only member who will remain in the east is General Cowin, who will spend some time in New York.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Wild West Parade Will Be a Feature of the Exposition on Wednesday Forenoon.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Governor Holcomb to Lead the Procession Which Is to Be Great Spectacular--Mr. Kiralfy on Advertising.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday's admissions numbered 16,970, making the total attendance to date 1,052,783.  Yesterday's gate receipts were $4,554.90, and the admissions at the 25-cent evening rate numbered 2,516.  While this was not as large as the former evenings on which the reduced rate has been in effect, it was considerably more than double the average 50-cent evening attendance, so that it was a money winner even at that figure.  The reduced rate for Monday is not yet as generally understood as that for Thursday, but both these evenings, as well as Sunday, are henceforth to be 25 cents.</p>
                            <p>From a spectacular and historical standpoint, what will probably be the grandest event of the exposition period will take place tomorrow forenoon, when Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World joins with the United States government Indian exhibit under Captain Mercer in a parade of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>It is regarded as particularly fitting that this striking exemplification of the past should take place in connection with the demonstration of what has been achieved in later years in the Trans-Mississippi country, and it has been arranged to have presented an animated panoramic tableau covering the entire period leading up to the portrayal of the present, shown by the exposition itself.</p>
                            <p>In its personnel, the parade will go back to the time when this entire section owed allegiance to the Spaniard, as Colonel Alexander Majors, the veteran government freighter, who long since passed his four score years, will be in the line, and at the head of the imposing column will be Governor Holcomb.  Ex-Governors Boyd and Thayer, together with William A. Paxton, A. D. Jones, Colonel Inmans, John A. Creighton and a number of others prominent in the pioneer days will also take part.  These men have occupied a conspicuous position during the era that has marked the transition of the west from environments of pioneer savagery to those of progressive civilization, and have been personally identified with the various stages of the west's development, including the government train, the stage coach, the pony express, the transcontinental telegraph and the railroad.</p>

                            <head type="sub">A SPLENDID PARADE.</head>
                            <p>The parade will be a gorgeous affair in the matter of life and color, as the gaily caparisoned troopers of the various nations of the world will be in line, and with them representatives of thirty of the tribes of American Indians, being in this respect an occurrence the like of which will probably never be seen again.  The government has undertaken to bring representatives of its Indian tribes here, and Colonel Cody has assembled an aggregation such as no government would ever undertake to do, and both are by a happy coincidence to be joined for an hour on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The parade will enter the grounds at the gate on the east side of Sherman avenue, opposite the Auditorium, and move down the west side of the bluff tract to the Horticulture building, thence to the center boulevard and north to the Grand Plaza, passing in review before the Music Pavilion, thence through the Midway and up Twentieth to the Transportation building, countermarching on Twentieth to the Administration Arch, and out of the grounds through the gate at the Boys' and Girls' building.</p>
                            <p>It is interesting to know in this connection that the parade will traverse the identical spot where Buffalo Bill gave his first show in the early '80s, for the location of the first performance of the Wild West was on what is now the West Midway, at just about the spot where the Cyclorama is now situated.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SAME OLD CRITICISM.</head>
                            <p>Imre Kiralfy, senior member of the famous Kiralfy Bros., was on the grounds yesterday and will be in the city until this evening.  Mr. Kiralfy is now and has been for the past four years director general of the London exposition at Earl's Court and takes in all of the expositions and big art exhibits, with an eye open to new features and ideas.  He is now putting on the big naval exhibit in Madison Square garden, New York, which opened August 11, and will close September 25.</p>
                            <p>Kiralfy is universally known as the king of the spectacular, and is credited with knowing considerably more about the show business than the ordinary mortal.  When asked yesterday for his impressions of the exposition he said:  "It is fine&#8212;very fine, but it is not advertised."  Picking up one of the exposition pictures from a table in the Press building, he said:  "These ought to be in every hotel in New York.  They ought to be on the railroad trains.  They ought to be spread around by the million.  The exposition will be over before half of the people in the country know there is anything of the kind here."</p>
                            <p>Major H. C. Ward yesterday received a telegram from Acting Chief Signal Officer Dunwoody stating that Lieutenant Wildman would arrive here with the war balloon plant about the last of the week, the shipment having been made from Tampa.  Major Ward was asked to have things in readiness, including boiler makers, to go to work on the plant at once, and a big wooden tank, so that there might be no unnecessary delay in getting the exhibit in operation.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NOT SANTIAGO BALLOON.</head>
                            <p>Major Ward stated that the Santiago balloon would not be the one used here, as that was badly shot to pieces, but it will be sent here for use in conjunction with the other in case it is needed.  The site for the balloon has not yet been selected, although Major Ward is in favor of the east tract at the edge of the bluff, and will endeavor to secure the consent of the management to have it located there.</p>
                            <p>There is reason to believe that the life saving exhibitions will come to a speedy close unless more fresh water is turned into the lagoon.  The water there is about as inviting as a miasmatic swamp, and the smell arising from it has occasioned a protest from the members of the life saving crew, who are required to take several dips in it daily.  The member who officiates as the drowning sailor has been actually sick on account of his prolonged immersion in it, and Captain Knowles stated yesterday that if the crew as a whole became sick no others would be sent here to take their places and that the whole exhibition would come to an end.</p>
                            <p>Protests have been made from time to time and a little fresh water has been turned in, but not enough to materially improve the situation.  The management has been husbanding the water supply on the score of economy, but the life savers are inclined to balk when their health is to be tendered to pay the bill.  The trouble is not alone due to the fact that the water is stagnant, but it is also the receptacle of a quantity of refuse material daily.  The exhibition has become one of the most popular features on the grounds, and regular visitors are disposed to protest against any policy that may tend to interfere with it or do away with it altogether.</p>

                            <p>Twenty-four Crow Indians from Lame Deer agency, Montana, arrived at the Indian camp yesterday.  The delegation consisted of fifteen bucks, five squaws and four pappooses.  Captain Mercer also received news that two other delegations started yesterday from Oklahoma points and would be here in a couple of days.  One is a party of seventy-five Shawnees, Kickapoos, Pottawattamies, Omahas, Iowas, Pawnees, Sacs and Foxes, from the Shawnee agency, and fifty Tonkawas, Pawnees and Poncas from the Ponca agency at White Eagle.</p>
                            <p>A special excursion numbering between 800 and 900 arrived in the city yesterday from Kansas City.  It was made up of members of the Young Men's Christian association and Summit Street Presbyterian church and their friends.  The party made their first appearance on the grounds last evening.  They will remain until September 1.</p>
                            <p>The Old Plantation reopened for business yesterday afternoon, a mutually satisfactory agreement having been reached by the concessionaire and the exposition management, whereby the pending litigation is to be dismissed and the show allowed to continue as before.  It is stated that a compromise settlement was agreed upon, and that both sides were disposed to accept it rather than fight the matter in the courts.</p>
                            <p>The ladies' entertainment bureau yesterday renewed its request for permission to have a battle of confetti on the Grand Court on Friday evening at the masque carnival, but the executive committee again turned it down, as the stuff is a nuisance to clean up, and it would disfigure the Court for weeks.  It was suggested that the desired privilege could be exercised along the Midway after the carnival was over.</p>
                            <p>The buildings and grounds department was authorized to close contracts for buildings and pens for the live stock show, which is to be held in the enclosure south of the Indian camp.  The site originally intended is north of the tracks, but it was found that the time would be too short to admit of the completion of the buildings, as a part of the grounds will be used for the firemen's tournament, which will not close until September 10, leaving only nine days in which to get ready for the stock show.  The new site will prove more convenient for the public, and can also be handled at less expense by the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">United States Adds Another Entirely New Feature to Its Exhibit---New Plans for the Live Stock Show.</head>
                            <p>Omaha has never been thought of as a point for the dry docking of ocean vessels, but it has been demonstrated that it has all the advantages for this service to ships.  Indeed, the dry dock is already here, and the first vessel to be floated in rested on the blocks at 11:30 this forenoon, and was the American man-of-war, the Illinois.  The dock was found to work to perfection, and the gallant ship never careened an inch as the water left her sides.</p>
                            <p>It was in the Government building on the exposition grounds.  The performance elicited special interest, not only from the visitors, 200 or 300 of whom crowded around, but also from those connected with the government exhibit and others in an official capacity, such as General Manager Clarkson of the exposition, Superintendent Knowles of the life-saving exhibit, Captain Cox and Major Ward of the government board, Major Hambleton of the Illinois building and others.  Commander Stedman, in charge of the navy display, was the hero of the hour.</p>
                            <p>The dry dock is a model of that on Puget sound, which is capable of accommodating the largest ships, and like which the other dry docks at various places on either coast are to be.  The model of the Illinois, a beautiful piece of work costing an even $6,000, was afloat in water representing the sea outside the dock.  The mimic caisson was raised and floated so as to make a passageway for the vessel, and then by little hawsers this little Illinois moved up into the dock.  Though only a model, there was something majestic about her progress for this dozen feet  Once in and on the blocks for her keel, the books to prevent careening being placed and the four hawsers, two at each end, made fast and the watertight caisson replaced, the water was drained from the dock.  It ran out in this instance as water would run out from a bath tub, but on the coast it goes out another way.  The vessel is taken in at high tide.  The receding of the tide lowers the water in the dock a few feet, and the balance is pumped out with pumps having a capacity of 15,000 gallons per minute.</p>
                            <p>While the illustration was going on Commander Stedman made full explanations and answered such general questions about ships as were asked regarding the guns, the bridge, stripping a vessel, etc.</p>
                            <p>This is the first time that a model of a dry dock has even been exhibited by the government, and furnishes one more instance in which the present government exhibit excels any made before.</p>

                            <p>It is probable that the live stock show, which opens in October, will be on what is now the Indian performance grounds with the addition of a part of the tract called the irrigation farm.  It certainly will be here if it is decided that the Indian games and sports can be dispensed with.  It was the original intention to have to stock sheds and rings north of the Missouri Pacific tracks, and the reason of making the change is that visitors may not like to cross the tracks and be bothered with return checks.  The grounds north of the tracks are being prepared for the firemen's tournament, but no work has been done there not necessary for the tournament, so that there is no loss in <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Kansas City was in evidence about the city yesterday, a very large excursion coming in over the Missouri Pacific road, gotten up by C. E. Benham, under the auspices of the Summit Street Methodist church of that city.  A rate of $3 for the round trip was secured, the excursion worked up systematically, and a very large delegation took advantage of the unusually low rate and came to Omaha.  The tickets are good for four days, and this gives the party an opportunity to participate in Young People's day exercises, August 31, and Kansas City day, September 1.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the special train yesterday other special trains will be run today to accommodate those wishing to be present at Young People's day.  It is estimated that several thousand people will be on hand on Young People's day.  The Dellone hotel will be headquarters for the Summit Street church party.</p>

                            <p>Wednesday was World-Herald day at the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, and it was one of the days in the history of that great show which will remain fresh in the minds of not only the management of Nebraska's most enterprising daily paper&#8212;the World-Herald&#8212;but in the memories of the 200 or 300 country "yokels" who enjoyed the World-Herald's courtesy on that day.  The day in question marked the thirteenth anniversary of the Evening World, subsequently consolidated with the Herald, which is known throughout the country as one of the most enterprising and wideawake publications of the metropolitan press.  The World-Herald, on this occasion, showed the courtesy and benevolence of the World-Herald, on this occasion, showed the country newspaper men and their wives of the state a good time, they gave us a good square meal for dinner, and the toasts which followed were a feast of reason.  More than this, through the courtesy and benevolence of the World-Herald, every one of the multitude of attractions on the Midway were thrown open to the country publishers and their wives free of charge.  The result will be not only beneficial to the World-Herald, but a big stand-up for the exposition, because all of us boys have been shown the exposition in its entirety and can intelligently tell the people what we have seen, and none of us will feel half-hearted in expiating on the grandeur of the exposition through our various country weeklies.  In conclusion, Mrs. Page and I are exceedingly grateful for the courtesies shown by the World-Herald on August 24, and trust that Nebraska's leading paper may continue in its promulgation of economical truths and achievements of financial success.</p>

                            <p>In our more than thirteen years of newspaper experience in Nebraska no more enjoyable time has been enjoyed by us than on last Wednesday in Omaha.  Ourself and wife, in response to a previous invitation from the management of the World-Herald, boarded the early train for that city to help make World-Herald day at the exposition a big day, for the letter informed us that our presence, with that of other members of the press from all over the state, would be necessary to make them happy.  About 300 editors and wives were on hand at the Millard hotel at the appointed hour of 11 o'clock, and were greeted by Mr. Metcalfe and other members of the World-Herald staff, with their handsome wives.  Each of the visitors was furnished with a beautiful ribbon badge, upon which was printed, "The Wearer Owns the Earth Today," and it was about so, at least much more than we could possibly make use of in one day.  At 5 o'clock the ladies of the exposition management held a reception for the "ladies and their husbands" in their beautiful parlors in the Mines building, where ices were served the guests, while they were entertained by about a dozen handsome ladies.  Fireworks in the evening ended up the greatest ovation by editors ever given in Nebraska, and by Nebraska's greatest daily newspaper.  Long live the World-Herald.</p>

                            <p>We accepted the World-Herald's invitation to be their guest at the exposition on Wednesday, August 24, in honor of its thirteenth anniversary, and to say that we were treated royally would be putting it mildly.  The editors met at the Millard hotel and at 12 o'clock, on special cars and headed by the McCook band, went to the exposition grounds.  While at the hotel each editor and wife or friend, were decorated with a press badge, and a blue ribbon, on which was the words:  "World-Herald Day, August 24, 1898.  The Wearer Owns the Earth Today."  Those who did not have passes to the exposition were provided with them.  Arriving at the grounds, they marched to the Markel cafe, where lunch was served and a toast program given, with Mr. Hitchcock, proprietor of the World-Herald, as toastmaster.  Passes to all Midway attractions were distributed and the editors went sightseeing, some not getting through until midnight.  The World-Herald fireworks at 9:20 were as fine as those of the night of July 4, and the editors had reserved seats.  World-Herald day will long be remembered by the country editors, nor will they ever forget the kind hospitality of Mr. Hitchcock and his assistants, who labored hard to show their appreciation of and friendship for the "country yokels."</p>

                            <p>Wednesday was World-Herald day at Omaha.  The Post editor had made calculations to be present, but unavoidable circumstances arose preventing.  Thirteen years ago the Evening World was launched on the newspaper tide, and was a success from the first issue.  The Post editor became an employe of the publication four weeks later and remained with the paper nearly three years.  During that time great changes took place in the Omaha newspaper world, but the Evening World at once assumed a prominent part in the front rank.  G. M. Hitchcock is one of the best men we ever met, and it was to him the union printers of Omaha were indebted for the raise in wages that marked a new era in Omaha from almost the very inception of his paper.  Never before or since have printers in the Missouri valley made the wages that were paid on the Evening World.  We look back to those good and glad old pay days with tears in our eyes.  We should like to have been with the boys on Wednesday and recalled many happy circumstances that are still fresh in "memory's cell," but can only add that the wish of the Post is that the World-Herald's day may be long <unclear reason="torn"/> and most of the editors had none.  Special street cars escorted the guests to the exposition grounds, headed by the McCook band.  The hungry editors and ladies repaired at once to the Markel cafe, where a great repast awaited them.  After menu a fine program was carried out, with G. M. Hitchcock as toastmaster.  But it was on the Midway where the country editor shined.  The World-Herald supplied every guest with a free pass to the thirty-five attractions, and we took them in without money and without price.  In the evening a grand display of fireworks was given.  It was, indeed, a great day for the editors; a great hit for the World-Herald; a great advertisement for the exposition, and a great religious gathering.</p>

                            <l>(Havelock Times.)</l>
                            <p>It was not necessary for the Omaha World-Herald to entertain the Nebraska editors and their families last Wednesday.  It was not even needed in order to create a good feeling among the "country yokels" for that metropolitan paper.  That good feeling has been earned in other ways and the World-Herald has had abundant evidence of its existence.  Therefore that the World-Herald did put itself and its force to a vast deal of trouble and no small expense in getting the rural newspaper workers together to assist it in celebrating an anniversary is simply saying that such magnificent hospitality and courtesy is second nature to the World-Herald.  Nor did the World-Herald make the occasion purely an advertisement for itself.  The great exposition was thrust into the foreground, as was also our glorious commonwealth and its interests.  In this particular the World-Herald again showed a pronounced peculiarity in the Omaha newspaper field.  Instead of eternally ringing the changes on an egotistical "I" it takes the background and shoves great public interests to the front.  Perhaps the World-Herald, however, is not entitled to so much credit after all.  In just the same sense that the man who can't help being good should receive no credit for his virtue.  The source of inspiration for World-Herald methods lies in its proprietor, Mr. Gilbert M. Hitchcock.  We have not the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with the gentleman, but have been twice his guest.  On these occasions we have studied his characteristics to the best of our ability.  Our conclusions have been that Mr. Hitchcock is one of those rare gentlemen who are thorough gentlemen.  Men of the greatest caliber who are incapable of anything small or mean or egotistical.  Men who are men and who could not enjoy an auspicious event unless others enjoyed it with them.  Men who have the greatness of soul to recognize worth and value in fellow workers of humbler spheres and who wish to help the world to know and appreciate that worth and value.  For these reasons, then, perhaps we should be giving neither the <choice><sic>World-Heral</sic><corr>World-Herald</corr></choice> nor Mr. Hitchcock credit for what they have done, simply because it is their nature to do so and they could not do otherwise.  Men of baser natures caught in such acts would prove decidedly heroic.  Long live and prosper the World-Herald.</p>

                            <l>(Schuyler Quill.)</l>
                            <p>World-Herald day at the exposition was a delightful success&#8212;delightful to visitors, to the editors who were special guests, to the exposition management and to the World-Herald, in whose honor the day was passed.  It was the thirteenth anniversary of the Evening World, which was later consolidated with the Omaha Herald.  The editorial fraternity of the state was invited and a large number were present.  Headed by the McCook band, six of the largest street cars in Omaha left the Millard hotel at 12:10 p. m., filled with solid matter justified and tightly locked.  No dead matter was <choice><sic>admissable</sic><corr>admissible</corr></choice>, but when the boys reached the Markel restaurant on the exposition grounds they adopted the use of plates to the exclusion of everything else.  And the plate service furnished by the Markel restaurant was up to date and type high.  After the eat-ition was off toasts were responded to by Dr. George L. Miller of Omaha, George L. Burr of the Aurora Register, G. W. Hurlbut of the Aurora Sun (who read George Wells' paper), W. J. Waite of the Exeter Enterprise, W. T. Howard of the Schuyler Sun and Judge Edgar Howard of the Papillion Times.  All of the toasts were good and highly appreciated.  Brother Howard of the Sun had a very dry subject, "The Exposition as an Educator," but he did credit to himself and to Schuyler in treating it.  During the banquet a card was passed to each publisher admitting himself and lady to all of the thirty-four attractions on the Midway.  The editors had been previously provided with badges, on which was printed:  "World-Herald Day, August 24, 1898.  The Wearer Owns the Earth Today."  And it would seem that he did.  Spielers, gate keepers, ticket sellers and all threw everything open to these badges.  You could see anything you wanted to and without dropping a penny in the slot.  And a lot of the attractions are well worth seeing.  For want of time and space we will not enumerate this week, but only say, see Midway.  The evening fireworks were the best of the season; they were magnificent.  To the World-Herald be ascribed the glory and honor of doing the right thing and doing it well forever and ever.</p>

                           <p>"Missouri has missed one of the opportunities of its history," remarked President Norman J. Colman of the Missouri State Board of Agriculture this morning as he saw the people pouring into the grounds by thousands and reflected that this was the day on which Missouri would have owned the show had the original plans of the state commission been carried out.  And then he began to stir up the other members of the board with a view to making the best of the situation by preparing for a second effort in the line of a state celebration that would bring more satisfactory results.</p>
                           <p>President Colman is only one of hundreds of people who now realize the possibilities that are opened to the transmississippi states through the exposition.  Two months ago state celebrations and other special events were only secured through the energetic efforts of the exposition management.  But now the situation is reversed.  The people begin to realize more adequately the scope and value of the exposition, and those who were previously lukewarm are falling over each other to get into the band wagon and secure for their localities the greatest possible participation in its certain success.  There are quite a number of influential Missourians on the grounds, and they were unanimous in their regret that the plans for today's celebration had not been carried out regardless of the differences between the commissioners and the railroads.  Now the task of arranging for the event will have to be performed over again, but they declare that their people are now thoroughly aroused to the benefit that they will received and that when the second date is set they will unite to make the day such a success that today's failure will be wiped out of recollection.</p>

                           <head type="sub">There Were Others Present.</head>
                           <p>While the exposition officials expressed regret that their expectation of entertaining several thousand Missouri visitors today was not fulfilled, their disappointment could scarcely endure in the face of the encouraging conditions of the day.  The first three days of this week have been entirely destitute of special feature, but the attendance has been unprecedented.  The biggest Sunday crowd in several weeks was followed by the biggest Monday of the exposition with the single exception of July 4 and today promises to break another record.  It looked like another Fourth of July to see the motor trains pulling up at the gates with people hanging on by their eyebrows and inside the grounds there were as many people by 11 o'clock as are usually seen in the middle of the afternoon.  Yet the turnstiles clicked as industriously as ever and a 20,000 crowd seems assured.  The rest of the week is crowded full of interesting features and this magnificent beginning indicates that the high water mark of last week will be elevated beyond all expectations.</p>
                           <p>The manner in which the Jubilee week celebration is being commented on all over the United States indicates it has already awakened the whole country.  It is being favorably considered both in the news and editorial columns of nearly every newspaper in the country and especially in the east, where the big dailies are giving it marked attention.  The belief is everywhere expressed that it will be one of the biggest events ever experienced in the west and there is a general disposition to push it along that is very encouraging to the exposition management.  Everything is now ready for the special committee that will start for Washington by the middle of the week and after it has formally tendered the hospitalities of the exposition to President McKinley the arrangements for the various celebrations that will fill the week will be rapidly executed.  The plans already announced will occupy the bulk of the week, but a number of additional features will be decided on early in September.</p>

                           <head type="sub">President Colman of the State Board of Agriculture on the Topic.</head>
                           <p>President Norman J. Colman of the Missouri State Board of Agriculture arrived on the grounds yesterday to attend the meeting of the board in the Agriculture building today.  At this meeting the question of a Missouri day celebration will be vigorously taken up and the sentiment of members of the board indicates that some decided action will result.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Colman was secretary of agriculture in President Cleveland's first cabinet and has always been prominently identified with the agricultural interests of his state.  In speaking of the exposition he expressed the most sincere regret that Missouri has not taken a more prominent part in contributing to its success.  "It makes me feel ashamed of my state," he declared, "when I see this magnificent exposition and the splendid representation of Iowa, Georgia and a dozen other states and then consider that Missouri, the fifth state in the union in wealth and resources, and the first in the transmississippi territory, has no part in the enterprise.  Missouri was one of the first to give it encouragement when it was suggested, but it has been sadly delinquent in contributing its share to make the exposition what it is.  This is not an account of any lack of interest on the part of its people, but it results from the too conservative financial policy of the legislature, which prevented us from getting an appropriation."</p>
                           <p>In speaking of the abandonment of Missouri day Mr. Colman said that it was much regretted by the people of Missouri and that he was confident that steps would now be taken to secure a new date and to celebrate it in a manner that would to some degree atone for the previous disappointment.</p>

                           <head type="sub">Cody Day Will Bring Together Wonderful Ethnological Aggregation.</head>
                           <p>Cody day will be the feature on the exposition grounds tomorrow, when there will be presented an animated panoramic tableau of the past and the present of the American Indian.  At 11 o'clock Colonel William F. Cody, at the head of his congress of all nations, will enter the exposition grounds at the gates on Sherman avenue, just south of the viaduct that spans the street at a point opposite the Grand Plaza.  At that point he will be joined by Captain Mercer and the members of the Indian congress.  The procession will form on the Grand Plaza and will be headed by Governor Holcomb, Colonel Cody, Captain Mercer, the officers of the exposition, ex-Governors Boyd and Thayer, William A. Paxton and a large number of the pioneers of <choice><sic>Negraska</sic><corr>Nebraska</corr></choice>.</p>
                           <p>When once formed the parade will pass along the East Midway, over the West Midway to Twentieth street and from there to the Indian congress grounds, countermarching over the same route and going as far as the Administration arch.  At that point the members of the Indian congress will drop out of the procession and the Cody contingent <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> pass out of the grounds by going up the streets in the rear of the Machinery and the Mines building, through the gates in the rear of the Boys' and Girls' building.</p>
                           <p>The exposition management is featuring the parade as one of the biggest events of the season and are anticipating a big crowd during the forenoon.  They say that the parade will be the greatest ethnological event in the history of the world, as it will bring together representatives of at least 100 tribes of American Indians and people from fully thirty-five different foreign countries.  All of the people in the parade with the <unclear reason="torn"/>dians, will be mounted and will be clothed in the garb of the country from which they come.  That the public may be able to designate the different nationalities represented in the parade, each detachment will carry its banner conveying the desired information.</p>
                           <p>Major Burke, Colonel Cody's representative, was on the grounds a greater portion of yesterday afternoon in consultation with the exposition people and Captain Mercer, arranging the details for the parade, and succeeded so well that it is probable that there will be no hitch in any portion of the program.  As the occasion of the parade has been designated as Cody day, it was decided to allow Colonel Cody's congress of nations to lead the procession, to be followed by the members of the Indian congress.</p>

Senator Thurston returned in the morning from a trip of several weeks in Idaho with some benefit to his health, though he is still quite unwell.</p>
                           <p>It was decided that the party will leave either Wednesday or Thursday and arrangements for their transportation have been made so that they may travel in a body.  The exact date is dependent up a telegram sent to Secretary J. Addison Porter as follows:</p>
                           <p>J. Addison Porter, Secretary to the president:  A delegation of representative citizens, accompanied by myself, would appreciate an interview with the president, either the last of this week or the beginning of next, to tender to him an official invitation to visit the Transmississippi Exposition during Jubilee week.  Can it be arranged?</p>

                           <p>if the president can be seen on Saturday, the delegation will leave on Wednesday and arrive in Washington on Friday.  If that arrangement is made in accordance with the desire of most of the delegation Friday will be spent in calling on other officials whose presence is desired.  Invitations will be proffered to the entire diplomatic corps representing foreign governments as well as to the cabinet and others in authority.  As a member of the exposition directory John L. Webster is in charge of the delivery of these invitations.  Arrangements will be made for a special train for the convoy of the presidential party and the details of their reception here will be adjusted.</p>
                           <p>When the mission of the delegation is completed the party will break up.  General Cowin will continue to New York and others will return home separately.</p>

                           <p>There is considerable stir around the Horticultural building over the Peach day prospects.  It is the intention to have the feast on September 2, at which time numerous baskets of peaches will be given away to parties who visit the building.

                           <p>The Illinois people say they have plenty of peaches at home, but owing to the distance they cannot get them here in good condition.  The same excuse for not coming to the center is made by many of the other state representatives, which leaves Nebraska the only state that has peaches to give away and then have an abundance on hand.  It was the original intention of Superintendent Youngers of the Nebraska exhibit to secure 1,000 baskets of peaches for free distribution, but owing to the changed condition of affairs he has now laid his plans and if the other states stay out he will have 5,000 baskets on hand.  At this time he is in correspondence with the largest peach growers in the state, and as far as returns have been received all of them express a determination to help furnish the evidence to prove to the world that Nebraska is the greatest of peach growing states.</p>
                           <p>Los Angeles county, California, has added some novelties to its exhibit, one of which is an article known as St. John's bread fruit, a tree that is being cultivated to some extent.  The tree grows to a height of thirty feet and begins bearing the fruit

                           when it has reached the age of about 10 years.  While the product is called fruit it does not resemble any fruit in any particular.  Instead of being a fruit it is a pod that closely resembles the honey locust.  Inside each pod there are a number of little beans, which, when dry, are as hard as stone.  These are ground into meal and when mixed into batter and cooked the cakes taste very much like a combination of banana, muskmelon and ripe pawpaw.  As yet there is no market for the product, it being raised principally as a fad and a curiosity.</p>
                           <p>Another novelty that is being shown by Superintendent Wilson of the exhibit is the mango, a tropical fruit.  The mango is about the size of a Burbank plum and is a bright green on the outside.  When ripe the fruit is as yellow as custard and it tastes very much like it.  The fruit is so soft and delicate that it is next to impossible to ship it out of the country and for this reason it is seldom seen outside of the immediate section where it is raised.</p>
                           <p>California quinces are now coming in in large numbers and are unusually large this year.  While but few of them are ripe at this time, they make a good showing and add variety to the exhibit.</p>
                           <p>In addition to other fruit, Superintendent Wilson has received a considerable shipment of apples, including the Western Beauty, Pennsylvania Red Streak and Alexanders.  They are all very large and finely colored.</p>
                           <p>Hawaii is not the only section of the world that is showing coffee.  Superintendent Wilson has received several of the plants, sent on by Jacob Miller, a fruit grower who devotes a great deal of his time to experimenting with tropical products.  He is firmly convinced that most, if not all, of the products can be raised in the country around Los Angeles.  The coffee has a large berry and rich color.  As yet no coffee has been shipped from southern California, but the people in charge of the exhibit at the exposition feel confident that before the end of five years it will be one of their leading crops.</p>
                           <p>Superintendent Stanton of the Illinois exhibit is devoting much of his time just now to sowing grapes.  Yesterday he placed twenty varieties upon the tables, all from the State Experimental farm located at Champaign.  They are unusually finely colored and regular in size and shape.  This, he contends, is the result of spraying.</p>
                           <p>Idaho and Oregon have both received some fine consignments of plums, peaches and apples, but the parties in charge of the exhibits find some difficulty in getting the finer qualities of fruit here in good condition.  It is all right when it leaves home, but the long distance and the time required to get it here play sad havoc with its condition.  This, however, will not stop the shipments.  They are coming on daily and by receiving fruit so often, it is expected that the display will be kept very attractive.</p>

                           <p>Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation has taken up the question of reduced rates from eastern and southern points directly with the railroads interested.  Yesterday he sent a communication to each of the associations east of Chicago and southeast of St. Louis, asking them if they would accept a tender of one fare plus $2 for the round trip from the Western Passenger association.  If an affirmative reply is received immediate action will be taken to induce the Western Passenger association to tender the rate.</p>
                           <p>Manager Babcock has just received from Chairman Caldwell of the Western Passenger association the formal notice of the rates scheduled by the association last week.  A rate of 80 per cent of one fare from all points within 200 miles of Omaha for the Firemen's tournament, September 5, and Woodmen of the World day, September 9, is also announced.</p>

                           <p>Yesterday the population of the Indian village on the exposition grounds was increased by the arrival of twenty-four Crow Indians from the Lame Deer agency in Montana.  The party consists of fifteen men, five women and four children.  The interpreter in charge is Upan, a half breed.  The In-<unclear reason="torn"/> slim and athletic.  They are camped in front of the office buildings, just west of the Omahas.</p>
                           <p>Last night Captain Mercer received word from a number of the agencies in Oklahoma and Indian territory, announcing its departure of Indians for this city.  One party of seventy-five left Sunday night.  This includes Shawnees, Omahas, Kickapoos, Pawnees, Sacs, Foxes and Iowas.  Another telegram announces that fifty Indians will leave White Eagle, Ponca agency, Okla., for Omaha.  In this party there are Tonkawas, Pawnees and Poncas.  These Indians will bring the population of the village up close to 500 and will include representatives of nearly fifty tribes.</p>
                           <p>A large number of ponies from the Pottawattamies have been secured, but more are needed and have been sent for.  As soon as they arrive, preparations will be made for giving another sham battle in which only Indians will participate.</p>
                           <p>All of the Indians, and especially the Sioux, are looking forward with a good deal of interest to the arrival of Cody and his Indians who will visit the grounds tomorrow morning.

                           <head type="sub">Reduced Admission Brings Out the Local People in Force.</head>
                           <p>The crowd on the grounds last night indicated that the drawing power of the 25 cent admission has lost none of its force.  This is especially significant, as Monday night is usually one of the lightest of the week.  The crowd is largely composed of strangers, who are fatigued after their first day on the grounds and do not linger through the evening.  This proved the case last night and between 7 and 8 o'clock the returning motor trains were filled with exposition visitors, who preferred to rest rather than spend the evening on the grounds.  But the reduced night admission brought out such a local addition to the crowd that their departure was not noticed and it was one of the liveliest Monday nights since the show opened.  The concert was played to a big crowd and all the evening the Midway received an exceptionally liberal patronage.  Late in the evening President Wattles brought out a party of the visiting bankers, who were given a brief but satisfactory glimpse of the Midway.</p>

                           <p>In addition to having an exhibit in the Agriculture building, the new territory of Hawaii will show itself on the North Midway in a building the erection of which has just about been completed.  While this will be in the nature of an amusement concession, the features which will be shown will portray the dress, customs and habits of the people of the islands, as they existed a century ago and also as they exist at the present time.  The interior of the building will be decorated to conform with that of Hawaiian theater, with the stage settings peculiar to the territory.  There will be the dances of the country, which will be tipped off to the music as it is played there.  The Kalakaua sextet club will sing.</p>
                           <p>One of the features of the amusement section of the Hawaiian attraction will be the dance that the old king liked so well and which was so popular before the island was Americanized.  This dance is not put on in the public theaters throughout the island, as with the natives it is regarded as a sacred affair.  When old King Kalakaua was alive he was the owner of a splendid club house down along the beach and there he would repair with his friends to drink gin, which with him was the royal drink.  After the gin commenced to get in its work, Mr. Kalakaua would call in his dancing girls and then the fun would be fast and furious.  The people who will take part in these Hawaiian dances and other amusements have left the island and will be here in a few days, probably not later than the middle of next month.</p>

                           <p>Imre Kiralfy, the great spectacular showman, was in the city yesterday and spent all of his time at the exposition, visiting the main buildings and the Midway.  That he enjoyed the day goes without saying.  After making a tour of the grounds he said:  "It is about as good a thing as I have ever seen and is going to prove a great educator to the people who come here.  I have visited all the expositions held during the past twenty years and regard this as one of the best.  It seems to be perfect and complete in every particular.  The buildings are gems of architectural construction and contain as fine a class of exhibits as it would be possible to find anywhere.  In sending their exhibits the people seem to have displayed good judgment and have sent only things intended to interest the public.</p>
                           <p>Regarding the Midway and Midway attractions, Mr. Kiralfy said:  "The time has been reached when a Midway is regarded as a part of an exposition and is just as necessary as the big buildings and the exhibits.

                           <p>A very extensive and interesting display of zinc ores from the Galena mines has been added to the Kansas exhibit in the Mines building.</p>
                           <p>General Manager Clarkson has arranged to have 120 mounted bucks from the Indian encampment participate in Colonel Cody's parade on the exposition grounds at 11 o'clock Wednesday.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Field, who has been serving in the capacity of hostess at the Minnesota state building, left yesterday for her home in Minneapolis, where she will remain for a week or ten days.</p>
                           <p>The financial controversy between the management and the Old Plantation concession was satisfactorily settled last night, and the show was again opened.  The Old Plantation people concluded to pay their back percentages and take changes on being able to collect any damages that they might be awarded on account of the fire.</p>
                           <p>The Pennsylvania people are planning to send their new National guard on a trip to the exposition.  The matter has been quite generally discussed in the Pennsylvania papers, and it is stated that if the uniforms and equipment are secured in time there is a fair probability that the organization will make the trip in connection with the Pennsylvania day celebration.</p>
                           <p>Quite a lively rivalry is developing between the various marching clubs of Chicago as to which will make the most impressive appearance at the exposition on Chicago day, October 1.  The famous Cook County Republican Marching club is arranging to come to Omaha on a special train in full force, and not to be outdone, the Democratic Marching club is preparing to turn out and dispute the question of supremacy.</p>
                           <p>Captain Frederic Phinney is being extensively interviewed since he left Omaha with his band.  He tells everyone that the Omaha exposition excels everything that was ever constructed, except the World's fair.</p>
                           <p>Half a dozen bids for the construction of the hog and sheep pens and cattle and horse barns for the coming stock show were received by the executive committee yesterday afternoon.  No contract was awarded, and the bids will be considered at a future meeting.</p>
                           <p>Thomas E. Miller, president of the South Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical college at Orangeburg, is among the guests at the exposition.  He was scheduled to deliver a lecture at the Auditorium Wednesday evening, but has been obliged to cancel the engagement on account of ill health.</p>
                           <p>Commissioner Shingle of Hawaii has received notice of the shipment of another car of exhibits from Honolulu, which ought to arrive here within the next day or two.  This shipment includes sugar, growing sugar cane, rice, banana trees, a large collection of kindergarten work from the Hawaiian schools, together with idols and relics of the country prior to its civilization.</p>
                           <p>D. M. Dean of Seward, president of the Nebraska Millers' association, is in the city largely for the purpose of arranging for the celebration of a Nebraska Millers' and Manufacturers' day at the exposition.  Secretary Holmes of the Manufacturers' and Consumers' association took the matter up with General Manager Clarkson yesterday, and a date will probably be designated about the middle of September.</p>

                            <p>Colonel William F. Cody and his Congress of Rough Riders received a genuine Nebraska welcome at the exposition today.  The sentiments expressed by the old timers congregated on the platform, men who have known Buffalo Bill since his boyhood, were echoed by the cheers of an immense multitude that packed the Plaza and gave the veteran of pioneer days a greeting that was no less sincere than enthusiastic.  Cody day was a brilliant success from the minute the glittering cavalcade entered the gates until the last fluttering pennon had disappeared.</p>
                            <p>The parade arrived at the grounds promptly at 11 o'clock and was met at the gates by General Manager Clarkson and 150 mounted Indians from the Indian encampment.  It entered at the Sherman avenue gate and was massed in front of the band stand, where a large square space had been reserved for its reception.  As the pageant filed into the open space it was greeted with continuous cheering from the vast crowd that covered the entire plaza and crowded the main viaduct and every adjacent building.  This swelled into an ovation as Colonel Cody appeared on the magnificent chestnut presented to him by General Miles.  The party of officials and Nebraska pioneers which included Alexander Majors, Major Burke, John A. Creighton, James E. Boyd, W. A. Paxton, sr., ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, E. Rosewater, A. D. Jones, J. E. North, George Heimrod, John D. Creighton, Captain H. E. Palmer, H. T. Clarke, Governor Holcomb and Senator John M. Thurston, dismounted from the carriages and were escorted to seats on the band stand.  Then the crowd was treated to an exhibition of horsemanship that elicited another hurricane of cheers.  The open space reserved for the parade was much smaller than a city block and a portion of it had already been occupied by the first division.  But the eight and six-horse teams that pulled the coaches and artillery went into it as though it was a sixty-acre field.  One after another they came on a dead gallop, tore around the limited circle and wheeled into line without a halt or interference.  It was the prettiest spectacle that has been seen on the grounds and for five minutes the crowd cheered its appreciation.</p>

                            <p>The McCook band played an inspiring melody as the remainder of the cavalcade swept into place and then Buffalo Bill dismounted and was greeted with another ovation as he mounted the platform.  He was received by General Manager Clarkson, who expressed regret that President Wattles was unable to be present, and briefly extended the welcome of the exposition management.  In their behalf he expressed the sincere wish that the honored guest of the day might have the success in life that his career deserved and introduced Governor Holcomb who tendered the welcome of the state of Nebraska to one of its most honored sons.</p>
                            <p>Governor Holcomb assured Colonel Cody that he was glad to see him again on Nebraska soil.  The people of Nebraska had watched his career with a deep personal interest.  They consider him a fellow citizen and rejoice to see him make a triumphal entry into the metropolis of their state.  He referred to the exposition as an object lesson teaching what the progress of Nebraska has been since Colonel Cody's scouting days and suggested that the spectacle of today, comprising so many people of different races and countries, might never be seen again.  In conclusion he <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Major Clarkson then introduced Alexander Majors, the "father of them all," to add another welcome.  Mr. Majors was perceptibly moved as he took Colonel Cody by the hand and explained to those present that forty-four years ago his mother and brought him to his office, a boy 9 years old, and asked him if he could not pay a little money for his services.  He gave him a job at $25 a month, little thinking that he would be a man of such destiny.  Many men have made names for themselves in politics or business, but Nebraska had in Cody something better than them all.  Mr. Majors related how Cody's first month's wages had been paid him in silver half dollars which he had taken home and spread all over the table to show how rich he had become.</p>
                            <p>"I've been spreading it ever since," interjected Colonel Cody, and the crowd cheered in affirmation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Majors said in conclusion that the exposition is the biggest thing he ever saw.  He had visited the World's fair and the expositions at London, Edinburgh, and New York, but had never seen anything that equalled this.</p>

                            <p>Another short address was added by Senator Thurston, who said, "Colonel Cody, this is your day.  This is your exposition, this is your city and we all rejoice that Nebraska is your state.  You have carried its fame all over the world.  You have been honored by princes, emperors and kings.  But here you have a better title, one that grew out of the hearts of your fellow citizens.  Here you are 'our Bill.'  May God bless you and keep you and prosper you in your career."</p>
                            <p>As Colonel Cody advanced to the front of the platform to reply to these felicitations he was received with another burst of cheers.  He was plainly deeply affected by the evidences of esteem that greeted him and deplored his inability to adequately express his appreciation.  "You have so overwhelmed my thinking faculties," he declared, "that I cannot reply appropriately to the honors you have given me.  How little I thought years ago that the path of the scout and pony express rider would lead me to this.  I used to have an idea in those rough pioneer days that somewhere in more civilized communities men were rich and women were happy.  But I have learned that nowhere in the broad universe are men richer in their integrity nor women happier in their domestic kingdom than in Nebraska.  I have sought my fortune in many lands, but wherever I have been the emblem of our sovereign state has floated over our Wild West, and there it will remain as long as I am in the saddle.</p>
                            <p>"I will not comment on what you have done to make the exposition the peer of any that have gone before it.  What you have done for Nebraska has been well done.  Through your kindness today I have tasted the sweetest fruit that grows on Ambition's tree and now let me call on the Wild West to voice its appreciation of your welcome."</p>
                            <p>At the signal of Colonel Cody the Wild West then gave three ringing cheers for Nebraska and the Transmississippi Exposition.  Their band followed with "The Red, White and Blue," and at the last note of the melody the McCook band played the "Star Spangled Banner" and the Wild West fell into line for the parade through the grounds.</p>

                            <p>Three cheers were given for Cody and the Wild West, after which preparations to move the parade were commenced.  The carriages were brought in upon the Plaza and were occupied by the dignitaries who had occupied seats upon the platform.  Press Agent Fellows of Colonel Cody's aggregation provided an overland stage coach, which he turned over to the newspaper men.  Following this came the state, exposition officials and the invited guests, with Colonel Cody in the lead, mounting upon the splendid chestnut gelding, Duke, presented to him by General Miles soon after the battle of Wounded Knee.  Then there were the Cossacks, the Cubans, the German cavalry, the Sixth United States cavalry, the Mexicans and representatives of twenty-five foreign countries.</p>
                            <p>In the wake of the Cody procession rode Captain Mercer and the 250 Indians who are in the congress on the north tract.  The line of march was up the East Midway, over the North viaduct and west over the North Midway.  At Twentieth street the procession turned and went north, proceeding as far as the gates of the Indian congress, where it countermarched as far as the Midway and then moved down that street to the Administration arch, where it was reviewed by the members of the executive committee of the exposition.  From this point the parade passed in the rear of the Manufactures and Electric building to the Sherman avenue gate and disbanded, <unclear reason="torn"/> show grounds and Captain Mercer's Indians back to their camp.</p>
                            <p>After the parade Colonel Cody, assisted by Major Burke and Press Agent Fellows, entertained a number of the colonel's friends at Markel's, where a private dinner was served.  Several short speeches were delivered over the cigars and wine, all of the speakers having only words of praise for Colonel Cody and his successful efforts in making Cody day one of the biggest since the opening of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Live Exhibit in the Omaha Section Interests Many Visitors.</head>
                            <p>The live exhibit of the manual training department of the Omaha High school, which occupies the west gallery of the Manufactures building, is a feature of no little interest to the out-of-town people who visit the exposition.  The exhibit is instructive even to Omaha parents, who are presumed to be passably familiar with local educational methods, and it is an entirely new thing to the bulk of the outsiders who visit the building.  They watch the deft work of the school boys with unconcealed admiration and judging from the remarks dropped by many of the visitors, it is not unlikely that this exhibit will be productive of quite a vigorous agitation in favor of manual training in the schools of quite a number of the smaller towns in Nebraska and Iowa.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit is under the personal direction of Superintendent Wigman of the manual training department of the Omaha schools and the facilities include four turning lathes, two work benches and a band saw.  About a dozen boys, members of the first year class, are employed continually in turning out samples of work just as they do in their regular school work.  Each boy takes a piece of work and carries it through and it is quite interesting to see how rapidly and accurately they work out the design.  At the benches the pieces of wood are dressed, jointed together and glued solidly.  Then the piece is put in a lathe and fancy cups, darning balls, cigar holders and a score of other useful articles are turned out and polished until they are really handsome pieces of cabinet work.  Everything must be done perfectly and it is surprising what perfect joining is done by these boys, who have only been in the department a year, and are just beginning what is called finish work.</p>
                            <p>A number of cases at one side of the exhibit illustrate more broadly the scope of the department.  One case shows the work of the first year and another that of the second while a large one in the center contains fully 100 samples of completed work, much of which displays a remarkable degree of skill.  The interest that is taken in this work by the pupils is indicated by the fact that the boys who constitute the "live" feature of the exhibit are voluntarily spending their vacation doing exactly the same work that they would be occupied with if school was in session.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Magnificent Painting Saved from Destruction by Timely Action.</head>
                            <p>Had it not been for the presence of mind of three men the beautiful picture known as "Trilby," shown on the East Midway by L. Lincoln, would have been totally destroyed yesterday afternoon.  The picture is shown in a building that was constructed specially for the purpose and is lighted only by electric lamps placed in hoods above the picture.  This causes the room to be very dark.  During the afternoon one of the electric fans in the room got out of order and a workman went in to repair it.  He struck a match in order that he might examine the fan and almost instantly the flame caught the light drapery and spread toward the picture.  Without trying to extinguish the flames this man rushed out and told Manager Jamison of the Maze that the "Trilby" concession was on fire.  He in turn called Messrs. Feldor and Shiplor and the three hurried into the burning building and, tearing the picture from its fastenings, carried it to a place of safety and then went back and with an extinguisher put out the fire before it had done any damage, aside from burning the drapery on the walls and ceiling, which is cloth and can easily be replaced.</p>
                            <p>At the time of the fire Mr. Lincoln was downtown and upon his return immediately put men at work repairing the damage.  They worked all night and sometime this afternoon the concession will be doing business as usual.  The picture was not damaged in the least.</p>

                            <p>At a full meeting of the committee of fifty of the Bureau of Entertainment this morning every member was pledged to participate in the masked carnival Friday night.  It was decided that gentlemen in evening dress and women in costume will be admitted to the parade as well as those who are in mask.  Those who expect to participate in the parade will meet at the Auditorium promptly at 8 o'clock, where attendants will be ready to give all necessary assistance.  It is announced that the Battle of Confetti will positively be a feature of the carnival.  The objections of the exposition management have been met by confining the feature to the roped space in front of the Government building, and as no confetti will be sold on the grounds, those who wish to participate in the novelty will be compelled to bring their ammunition with them.</p>

                            <p>The test of the butter in the Dairy building is being made.  W. B. Collyer of the firm of C. F. Love &amp; Co. of Chicago, who is recognized as one of the expert butter testers of the country, arrived yesterday and at once commenced upon his task, which will be completed some time today, when the scores will be given out.</p>
                            <p>All butter that has been entered for competition is in the cases on the south side of the building, where the temperature has been cooled to about 40 degrees.  It is in this place that Mr. Collyer does his work.  There are something like 150 packages of dairy and creamery butter to be tested, which makes the process no easy job.  In order that the scorer may not know where the butter comes from, each package is given a number, which corresponds with a number that is kept in the possession of Commissioner Dinsmore, who also keeps a book showing the name of the exhibitor.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the butter on exhibition, Mr. Collyer said: "It is as fine a lot as I have ever seen.  Of course, there is some poor butter, but on the while it is excellent."</p>

                            <p>Vice President H. B. Maxson of Nevada writes Manager Rosewater that the excursion of the Nevada Press association has been postponed until later in the season.  At the time of writing he was engaged in getting up another excursion of Nevada people and expected to leave with it August 29.  He reports that the people who have visited the show have come back with the most glowing accounts of its magnificence and interest and that many people from that state will make the trip during the next two months.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime Mr. Maxson has been industriously booming the exposition through the Nevada press and a number of interesting articles have appeared in various papers over his signature.  The Daily Independent of Elko carries a list of the Nevada representatives of the exposition, including the commissioners from each country, in large type on its first page, and a recent issue contained a column article by Mr. Maxson in which the attractions of the exposition and its value to Nevada were very effectively presented.  The Nevada State Journal of August 13 contains another very elaborate letter from Mr. Maxson in which he briefly describes the principal features of the grounds and buildings and calls attention to the fact that Nevada should be more adequately represented.</p>

The West Pointers are preparing to send a special excursion to the exposition on that day and they expect to bring a very good crowd.  Friday will also be signaled by the arrival of the biggest and most important editorial excursion that has yet visited the show.  The members of the National Editorial association will arrive at the grounds Friday morning in their special train of fifteen Pullman cars.  They will be sidetracked on the Missouri Pacific tracks at the northwest corner of the grounds and will occupy the cars during their three days' visit.  It is expected that the party will include about 500 editors, representing the entire territory east of the Missouri and as they will not leave for Denver before Sunday night they will have quite a satisfactory opportunity to arrive at an adequate appreciation of the merits of the exposition.</p>

The exclusive privilege of selling refreshments in the park is given to the parties who advance the money until money from the park funds can be used to acquire the absolute title to the building for the city.  The refreshment privilege ought to pay interest upon the money expended and the necessary funds easily raised if the Minnesota commission do not ask too much for the building.  Inasmuch as the building was constructed as an advertisement for Minnesota and its location in a popular park would make it a permanent advertisement, the commission will see the advantage of the plan.  The building is one of the most beautiful and unique upon the grounds, and it is to be hoped that our south siders will succeed in obtaining it.</p>

                            <p>The concert on the bluff tract last night was by the exposition chorus and the McCook band.  The most striking feature of the concert was a spectacular production similar to the selections which have proven so attractive and popular since their inauguration by Superintendent Kelly several weeks ago.  This selection was entitled "American Battle Scene," by Tobani, and included the popular melodies of the northern and southern armies during the civil war, together with popular and sacred songs.  The latter were sung by the chorus with excellent effect and the selection concluded with "The Star Spangled Banner," which was accompanied by a pyrotechnic display which was even more extensive than the former exhibitions of this nature.</p>
                            <p>Several thousand people filled the plaza during the concert and the climax was greeted with prolonged applause.  Not satisfied with expressing their appreciation in this way large numbers of people crowded about the music pavilion after the concert and congratulated Superintendent Kelly and Leader Sutton of the McCook band upon the success of the performance.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee decided yesterday to devote Monday to an informal visit to the various state buildings on the grounds.

                            <p>The board of park commissioners, at a special meeting yesterday afternoon, unanimously passed the following resolution:</p>
                            <p>Be it resolved, That the board of park commissioners is in sympathy with the desire of the South Side Improvement club to obtain the Minnesota building at the exposition grounds for a permanent building in Riverview park; that said building is substantial, beautiful and adapted architecturally to a site such as is afforded in Riverview park.  The fact that it is built of Minnesota material and commemorates that public spiritedness and good will of the people of Minnesota will give it a perpetual charm and interest.</p>
                            <p>Be it further resolved, That the board regrets that the condition of the park funds and the large prospective expenditures for next year in connection with the exposition grounds and improvements now in progress, renders it unable to purchase said building at this time.</p>
                            <p>Be it further resolved, That if the South Side Improvement club advances the money for the purpose this board will negotiate for said building, remove and reconstruct the same in Riverview park, and as a means of repayment of said money give the exclusive privilege of selling refreshments in Riverview park subject to reasonable restrictions as to quality, price and manner of selling, to be determined by this board, to any proper person designated by said South Side Improvement club until such time as the city shall repay to said club the money advanced as aforesaid and acquire the absolute ownership thereof.</p>

                            <head type="sub">"CODY DAY."</head>
                            <p>This is "Cody day" at the exposition.  The most cosmopolitan city in the world never saw so many races mingling together as may be seen at the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition today.  Twenty different tribes of Indians, soldiers from every civilized country, Chinese, Japanese, Arabs, East Indians, Cubans, Italians, Germans, Irish, English, Scotch, Swedes, Danes, Norwegians, Russians, Bohemians, Prussians, Swiss, Greeks, Turks, Canadians, French, Portuguese, Welsh, Hollanders, Belgians, Armenians, Javanese, Hawaiians, Samoans, Poles&#8212;all these nationalities and many more will be represented upon the exposition grounds today.  It will be a sight never before witnessed, and it may never be witnessed again.</p>
                            <p>But the appearance of Colonel Cody and his "Wild West" will serve to show by contrast with the great exposition the wonderful strides of the Trans-Mississippi region during the last generation.  The life depicted by Colonel Cody and his fellow showmen is within the memory of many who have not yet passed the meridian of life.  There are in the Trans-Mississippi region thousands of men who can remember the time when the scenes depicted in the "Wild West" show were every day occurrences in this region.  And in this short space of time the evolution of the west has reached the magnificent stage presented by the beauties of the great exposition.  The world has never before seen such a wonderful advancement in civilization, in art, science, manufacture and education.  The world will never again see the like.  Colonel William F. Cody is typical of the west.  He is enterprising, full of vim and vigor that forces success and imbued with the western restlessness that is never content with what is at hand, but always striving for something better.  This is the spirit that has made possible the swift evolution from the sod house to the white palace of the exposition; made possible the evolution from a treeless, barren plain to a fruitful garden that invites all men from all climes.  From the "Wild West" to the Trans-Mississippi is a far cry measured in progress; it is but a step measured in time.  No other country could have taken it; no other people could have made it possible.</p>

                            <p>Several weeks ago Dr. George L. Miller conceived the idea that during the "New York days" at the exposition in October it would be a good plan to arrange for special excursions from New York and the New England states.  Dr. Miller made his idea known to exposition officials and thought the ball had been set in motion through S. R. Callaway, president of the New York Central.</p>
                            <p>President Callaway is an old friend of Dr. Miller, and the doctor was surprised that days passed by and no word was received from President Callaway.  Finally Dr. Miller wrote a personal letter to Mr. Callaway, setting forth his plan.  Last night Dr. Miller received the following telegram from the president of the New York Central:</p>
                            <p>"Fulton Chain, N. Y.&#8212;Dr. George L. miller, Deerfield, Neb.: No message received.  Rates will have to be made by agreement with other lines.  Will take up the matter at once.</p>
                            <ab>S. R. CALLAWAY."</ab>
                            <p>This means a great deal to the exposition, and it is believed that Dr. Miller's good effort will meet with realization.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Wednesday of the coming week will be "Second Regiment day" and the energies of the exposition management will be directed toward making the occasion one long to be remembered by the boys who braved all the terrors of death in the fever stricken pest hole at Chickamauga.  The Second regiment of Nebraska volunteers will be the guests of the exposition and a special program will be prepared to serve as an earnest of the good will and appreciation of the people of this section for the self-denial and patriotism displayed by the sons of Nebraska who responded to the calls of arms.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has been in correspondence with Colonel Bills regarding a day to be set aside for the Second regiment, and the idea was very favorably regarded by Colonel Bills, who left the date to be fixed by President Wattles, merely specifying that it should be three or four days after the arrival of the regiment in Omaha.  As the latest reports indicate that the regiment will arrive the latter part of the current week President Wattles fixed upon Wednesday of the coming week as the best day for the celebration.</p>
                            <p>A short program of addresses to the regiment in the nature of expressions of appreciation and gratitude for the spirit of patriotism displayed when the country was in danger will be arranged and men of prominence will be asked to take part in the exercises.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXERCISES AT THE FORT.</head>
                            <p>The regiment will march from Fort Omaha to the exposition grounds in the morning and will proceed directly to the Auditorium, where the short exercises will take place.  The speech making will be followed by a lunch, which will be served to the soldiers in their seats, in the same manner as the Third regiment was served by the ladies of the city.  This lunch will be of a substantial character and the people of the city will be asked to contribute to it within the next few days.  A committee will be appointed to take charge of this matter by the bureau of entertainment and the details will be carried out in the same careful style which characterized the serving of the bountiful lunch to the Third Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>This will conclude the formal part of the day's exercises, and the boys will own the whole exposition for the remainder of the day.</p>
                            <p>The striking feature of the attractions on the exposition program today will be the night exhibition to be given by the life saving crew on duty at the station on the lagoon.  This will be a great novelty and the indications are that the immense crowds which daily witness the exhibitions given in the afternoons will be greatly exceeded in point of numbers by the attendance at the night display.</p>
                            <p>According to the plan as arranged by Captain Knowles the night exhibition will be even more realistic than the daylight drills, which have attracted so much attention.  It will commence promptly at 8 o'clock and will require about forty-five minutes for its performance.  In order to make the exhibition as much as possible like the real thing the lights in the main court will not be lighted until after the rescuing process has advanced somewhat, although the light will be sufficient at all times to allow every portion of the drill to be plainly seen.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROGRAM FOR TONIGHT.</head>
                            <p>About 8 o'clock the member of the life saving crew who is acting as patrol will discover a ship in the offing showing a distress signal by burning a bright light, this being the universal signal in all maritime nations to denote that something is wrong and that the need for <choice><sic>assitsance</sic><corr>assistance</corr></choice> is urgent.  The patrol will reply to the signal by burning the universally understood answering signal&#8212;a red "Coston light."  The patrol will then hasten to the station and give the alarm and the crew will proceed at once to the nearest point with the beach apparatus and throw a line to the vessel.</p>
                            <p>About this time the lights in the main court will be turned on and the remainder of the exhibition will be plainly visible.  The usual maneuvers will be gone through with, including the capsizing of the boat, the rescuing of a drowning man, etc.</p>
                            <p>The maskers who participate in the grand carnival in the main court tomorrow night will be admitted to the grounds at half price, this matter being decided by the executive committee yesterday afternoon.  Those in costume will be admitted at the workmen's gate on Sherman avenue, immediately in the rear of the Auditorium, being the gate on the west side of Sherman avenue and not the one on the east side of the street.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee also decided that the spectacular battle piece which was performed by the McCook band and the exposition chorus so successfully Tuesday night should be repeated Saturday night of this week and orders to that effect were issued accordingly.</p>
                            <p>Chairman William Neville of the Nebraska commission was summoned to his home at North Platte last night by a telegram announcing the serious illness of his wife.  He left for home on the midnight train on the Union Pacific.</p>

                            <p>La Belle Carmen, the Cuban beauty, has created a sensation at the Streets of All Nations in her electrical act.  She appears on the stage decorated with hundreds of incandescent lights of varied colors, and the scene is indeed a gorgeous one.  The handsome Armand, also decorated with colored lights, appears at the conclusion of her dance and the two entertain the audiences with the lovely duet, "Galatia," "La Paloma" and other selections.  Those two stars are great drawing cards at the Streets of All Nations.  Mr. Imre Kiralfy, the noted London showman, visited the Streets of All Nations yesterday to see Mr. Akoun in regard to taking his attraction to the Elscourt exposition in 1899.  Mr. Kiralfy visited Mr. Akoun in Nashville last year on the same business, but on account of the Omaha exposition the matter was postponed.  Mr. Akoun is now considering the proposition and if suitable arrangement can be made he will take his show from here to London.  From there he will go to the Paris exposition and then he will return to America, when his show will be a main feature of the amusement section of the Buffalo exposition.</p>

                            <p>That is a hint of the picture.</p>
                            <p>It was on the Grand Plaza at the exposition, and where prevailed, among a thousand banners, "Old Glory," the most beautiful flag that ever kissed the skies.</p>

                            <p>Colonel Cody came modestly upon the stand before the assembled dignitaries and Major T. S. Clarkson welcomed him in his characteristically eloquent way on behalf of the city and the exposition.  Governor Holcomb followed with a cordial <choice><sic>speeech</sic><corr>speech</corr></choice> of welcome on behalf of the state and Senator Thurston spoke of the early history of the region and time in which the hero of the occasion was winning his way and the way of empire.</p>
                            <p>But when the venerable Alexander Majors, whom Colonel Cody affectionately spoke of as "Uncle Aleck," and who spoke of the gallant plainsman as "My Boy" and embraced him, the scene was one that touched the hearts of all beholders and tears came down the furrows that time has plowed in the faces of those present who have seen the west develop from the "Great American Desert" to a garden that is tinted with the bloom of the rose.</p>
                            <p>He told how forty-four years ago on this day William Cody's mother came to him bringing her 9-year-old boy, asking that the boy be given work to help support his fatherless sisters.  Eloquently the old man spoke of his admiration for the lad and his worthy ambition; how the boy was set to work for $25 a month as a pony express <unclear reason="torn"/> that day across the continent; how faithfully and fearlessly the boy did his work, and how, at the end of two months, Will Cody came into his mother's cabin and taking out the $50 he had earned, "spread it out with his hands all over the table."</p>
                            <p>"And I have been spreading it ever since," Cody interjected.  At which there was a roar of laughter and some one, given to the phraseology of the street, said:</p>
                            <p>"That's no dream."</p>
                            <p>With a kindly and gentle and truthful reminiscence the veteran went on with his stories of Cody, boy and man, and when he had finished Colonel Cody responded to all of this opulence of hospitable and even affectionate sentiment with these forceful words:</p>

                            <p>Governor Holcomb, General Clarkson, Uncle Aleck, Senator Thurston and Fellow Citizens of Nebraska: You cannot expect me to make adequate response for the honor which you have bestowed upon me today.  You have overwhelmed my speaking faculties, for I cannot corral enough ideas to even attempt a coherent reply to the honor which you have accorded me.</p>
                            <p>How little I dreamed in the long ago that the lonely path of the scout and the pony express rider would lead me to the place to which you have assigned me today, and here, near the banks of the mighty Missouri, which flows unvexed to the sea, my thoughts revert to the early days of my manhood when looking across this rushing tide toward the east to the Atlantic, where then I supposed all men were rich and all women were happy.  My friends, that day has come and gone and I stand among you a witness that nowhere in the broad universe are men richer in manly integrity and women happier in their domestic kingdom than in our own Nebraska.  (Great applause.)</p>
                            <p>I have sought fortune in many lands, but wherever I have wandered that flag of our beloved state has been unfurled to every breeze, from the Platte to the Danube; from the Tiber to the Clyde, the emblem of our sovereign state has always floated over the Wild West.  (Applause.)  Time goes on and brings with it new duties and responsibilities, but we old men, we men who are called "old timers," cannot forget the trials and tribulations that we had to encounter while paving the path for civilization and national prosperity.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>The whistle of the locomotive has drowned the howl of the coyote; the barb wire fence has narrowed the range of the cow puncher, but no material evidence of prosperity can obliterate our contribution to Nebraska's imperial progress.  (Applause.)</p>
                            <p>Gentlemen of the directory, I will not assume to comment upon what you have done to make this exposition the peer of all that had gone before.  Far abler testimony than I can offer has sped on electric wings to the uttermost parts of the earth, and what you have done in the interests of Nebraska has been well done.  (Applause.)(</p>
                            <p>Through your kindness today I have tasted the sweetest fruit that grows on ambition's tree, and if you will extend that kindness and let me fall back into the ranks, those rear ranks, as a high private in that rank, that will be honor enough for me.  (Applause.)</p>
                            <p>Now, will you extend that kindness and let me call upon the Wild West, the Congress of the Rough Riders of the World, to voice their <choice><sic>aprpeciation</sic><corr>appreciation</corr></choice> for the kindness that you have extended them today.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>When Colonel Cody closed he called to his assembled riders for cheers for the exposition, and from the throats of Cossacks, Cubans, English, French, German and American troopers, Vaqueros of Mexico, Gauchos of South America, cowboys of the plains and Indians from thirty tribes, went up a shout that was caught up and echoed by the vast multitude of witnesses of the imposing scene; a scene where savages in war paint emphasized the steps of progress from their wigwams of the wilderness to the sculptured architecture of the wonderful White City.</p>
                            <p>After the exercises had been concluded in the Plaza the distinguished guests re-entered the carriages, and the great pageant was quickly again in motion, and marched through the grounds, with the addition to the Wild West's brilliant procession of the United States Government's Indian Congress, bringing together, under command of Captain Mercer, U. S. A., more representatives of American Indians than were ever assembled in the history of the world, or than ever will be again, in all human probability.</p>
                            <p>The mighty cavalcade passed out through the gates, and that part of it belonging to the Wild West entertainment went on to the quarters of the aggregation at Twentieth and Paul streets, and Captain Mercer's contingent returned to its place on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The distinguished guests were escorted to the dining pavilion at Markel's, and there occurred one of the most noteworthy banquets that has ever been given in this city.</p>

                            <p>It being very necessary for Colonel Cody to go on duty at the Wild West entertainment, he made his adieux when the guests had been seated, and Major Burke welcomed the guests to the banquet in behalf of Colonel Cody, and spoke briefly in compliment to those present as being representatives of the genius, enterprise and energy that built up the noble commonwealth of Nebraska, the mighty empire of the west and this great exposition and exemplification of it all.</p>
                            <p>Over the champagne General Clarkson, who acted as toastmaster, called upon those present who were more or less given to oratory for sentiments befitting the occasion, and the result was a number of after-dinner speeches that would have done honor to any occasion that has ever been graced by eloquence in words.</p>
                            <p>The theme was the upbuilding of the west, with Colonel Cody as a factor in guiding empire to the region, and incidentally reminiscences of the times when the pioneers were laying the foundation of the great superstructure of occidental success.</p>
                            <p>Governor Holcomb spoke briefly upon the occasion in general.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Thayer expressed pride in the fact that he had commissioned Colonel Cody on his military staff and sent him abroad to acquaint the old world with Nebraska's opulence of resource, in which the gallant colonel had far exceeded what could have been even so much hoped for in that time.  He had not only carried to the old world and its people the story of the great west, but had in the meantime become the associate of princes and potentates, who learned from this representative of the west in a little time more than decades of reading might have taught them.  The ex-governor closed with an earnest commendation of his gallant staff officer, who, by the way, had been an honor to the military staff of all the succeeding governors of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Saunders paid a feeling tribute to Colonel Cody and was eloquent on the general theme.</p>

                            <p>Colonel W. L. Visscher of Chicago, who was an Omaha journalist a quarter of a century ago, was introduced by Senator Thurston as the "Poet of the Platte," and by request read his poem to Colonel Cody entitled "A Knight of the West," which was frequently interrupted by enthusiastic applause.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Colman of Missouri, ex-lieutenant governor of that state and the first secretary of agriculture of the United States, spoke on the general theme, but alluding to the exposition he said it would be a pity to destroy those buildings after the exposition is over, and declared that they should be preserved and future expositions held in them.</p>
                            <p>General Clarkson grew enthusiastic over this suggestion and delivered a glowing <choice><sic>speeech</sic><corr>speech</corr></choice>, in which he indorsed Governor Colman's suggestions, and declared that he was glad the proposition had come from some one not a citizen of Nebraska nor associated with the management of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>In his <choice><sic>speeech</sic><corr>speech</corr></choice> General Clarkson showed how the exposition, in the face of stringent times and in the excitement of the war, had been a gratifying success in every way, and declared that at least another six months of it should be given next year.</p>
                            <p>The venerable Mr. Majors being called upon, delivered a lengthy address, deeply interesting and full of history, that closely held the attention of every one within hearing.  He described the origin and usefulness of the "pony express" and told delightful stories of freighting over the plains when the company of which he was the head used 4,000 yoke of oxen for draft purposes and employed an army of more than 5,000 men to carry on its business.  Facetiously he spoke of the fact that after a while along came John Creighton with his telegraph construction and threw the pony express out of employment.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Creighton being called, pleaded guilty and would not argue the matter.</p>
                            <p>The hour for adjournment having arrived General Clarkson said some congratulatory things individually of all who had spoken, and as he alluded to them anonymously the guests called their names by acclamation as he approached them.  Finally he reached Senator Thurston and asked him to offer a parting sentiment.  The senator said that, listening to Mr. Majors, his thoughts had taken a serious bent and he had been thinking of the trials and dangers that these old men had passed through to develop the west as it had been developed.  This success had not resulted in so much a survival of the fittest as the destruction of the best in the matter of men, for those who had done the most <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Colonel Norman J. Colman, St. Louis, has been in the city for some days and left last night for home.  While here Colonel Colman arranged for a day for the Missouri live stock breeders, and says there are 8,000 or 10,000 of them in the state, and that he is almost sure that the matter can be so worked up that at least half of that number can be induced to come to Omaha to participate in the exercises of that day and see the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Colman is a leading member of the Missouri state board of agriculture and editor of the oldest and most influential agricultural paper in the west, the Rural World, and with his personal popularity, coupled with his position as a Missouri exposition commissioner, a member of the board, and an editor, he feels that he is safe in promising a large attendance of Missourians at the meeting.  The exposition management gave the date of October 19 for Missouri Stockmen's day and a meeting of the state board of agriculture will be held very soon and all details arranged.  Colonel Colman left feeling that the day was a success already.  A program will be arranged for the day and special railroad rates will be secured at once and the matter thoroughly advertised.</p>

                            <p>Kansas day is celebrated not only by the elaborate program that was prepared by the representatives of that state, but by the attendance of a crowd that even exceeds that of <del>Wednesday</del><add>the previous day</add>.  There were scores of people waiting at the main entrances when the gates were opened this morning, and all day others have been swarming through in constantly increasing numbers.  With a 25-cent admission and the first life saving drill by electric light on the boards tonight the crowd promises to pack the grounds.</p>
                            <p>A fair proportion of the visitors congregated in the Auditorium to hear the exercises of the day, and while they were waiting for the Kansas officials and speakers they were entertained by a very enjoyable concert program by the McCook band.  At 11 o'clock the official party filed in headed by the Caman Military band of Winfield, Kan., and conducted by President Wattles and General Manager Clarkson of the exposition and Governor Holcomb.  After a selection by the band President John E. Frost of the Kansas commission introduced Bishop Frank R. Millspaugh of Kansas, who invoked the divine blessing on all the interests that the exposition represents.</p>
                            <p>The McPherson quintette sang a selection with admirable taste and precision and responded to a well merited encore.  Governor Holcomb then extended the greeting of Nebraska to its sister state and said that his only regret was that all of the people of the whole country could not come and see the evidences of the remarkable achievements of Nebraska during the last quarter of a century.  He suggested that the visitors should feel at home in Nebraska, for the gorgeous emblems of their state grew in profusion to the very gates of the exposition.  The history of the two states is intertwined.  Both were admitted to the union under the same act, under the same peculiar conditions and the same courage and enterprise and endurance has alike characterized the people of each state.  In future as in the past each should be interested in the prosperity and development of the other.</p>
                            <p>The governor spoke enthusiastically of the future that lies before this favored portion of the continent.  With its fertile soil and yet undeveloped resources it will be the granary of the world.  The exposition shows what has been accomplished in one epoch, but other epochs are to follow that will show still greater advancement.</p>

                            <p>In the absence of Governor Leedy of Kansas, who was detained by illness, ex-Governor George W. Glick responded to the sentiments suggested by Governor Holcomb.  He said that Kansans have worked hard and faithfully to build up their state.  They have built 10,000 school houses and over 1,200 churches where the children of the rich and poor sit side by side.  Their agricultural advancement had been marvelous and they have every reason to be proud of the record of their state.</p>
                            <p>Another selection by the quintet preceded the address of President Wattles, who very happily expressed the pleasure it affords the exposition management to welcome such a representative party from the Sunflower state.  He briefly sketched the early history of Kansas, referred to the exciting controversy on the slave question that had accompanied its admission to statehood and had for some years after retarded its progress.  In seven years Kansas had seven territorial governors, approved four constitutions and attracted the attention of the world.  Drouth and grasshoppers brought new misfortune, and the transportation facilities were taxed to the utmost to carry the gifts of the nation to the people of a suffering state.  But good crops brought prosperity and Kansas repaid its debt to the nation by giving more troops in proportion to its population than any other state in the union to defend its flag.  With a soil unsurpassed in fertility by any in the world and with a people imbued with the spirit of originality and progress its prospects were full of promise of immeasurable prosperity.</p>

                            <p>President Thomas E. Wills of the Kansas Agricultural college spoke at some length on the value of higher education as a factor in public advancement.  He contended that higher education does not mean the perusal of a certain number of text books.  It means the development of the intellect, as the blacksmith <choice><sic>developes</sic><corr>develops</corr></choice> his biceps.  The manner in which this can best be secured was discussed at length.  Church, schools and money making schools are not, in his opinion, adapted to the purpose.  The free school is the true system and it should be open alike to all.  To this end it is urged that the state should furnish the schools, the teachers and the means to run them.  It should provide such accommodations as will afford the student the most economical means of living and thus bring education within the reach of the poorest citizen of the commonwealth.</p>
                            <p>This was followed by speeches by C. B. Hoffman, regent of the State Agricultural college, and Thomas Ware of Topeka.  After the exercises the party adjourned to Markel's cafe where an enjoyable lunch was served.</p>

                            <p>The heat that was experienced on the outside yesterday did not compare with the torridity that fairly frizzled the atmosphere in the Service building.  This was the occasion on which the regular monthly passes are issued to concessionists and their employes, and they swarmed in by the hundreds to secure their transportation.  But it developed that a large number of the proprietors were a trifle shy on their percentages, and these were given the option of settling up at once or paying their way into the grounds tomorrow.  Some of them fairly tore their hair for a couple of hours, but their demonstrations did not phase the man behind the grating, who stood pay on the proposition, "No money, no pass."  Some of the concessionists seemed to have the idea that it was a terrible outrage to coerce them into paying up and they expressed their feelings pretty forcibly.  Having vented their sentiments most of them settled their accounts and secured their passes.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEBRASKA'S MEDALS FOR FRUIT.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Some Evidence of the State's Superiority in This Particular Line.</head>
                            <p>Superintendent Youngers of the Nebraska fruit exhibit is furnishing some conclusive evidence that this it not the first exposition where the state has been in the lead in the way of showing first-class fruit.  The evidence is in the form of bronze and silver medals, all of which are in a case close to the fruit tables and under lock and key.</p>
                            <p>The first medal Nebraska won on its fruit was at a horticultural exhibit in Baltimore in 1871.  This was at a horticultural exhibit in Baltimore in 1871.  This was on a general exhibit.  The next was in Boston in 1873, and was given on account of the largest variety of pears being shown by any one state.  At that time Nebraska had forty-three varieties on exhibition.  The next prize was awarded in 1876, at the Centennial, when the state was given a medal for the best collection of fruit.  At the World's fair, Nebraska won a medal for having the best collection of grapes.  Prior to this time the state had won medals at Boston and Philadelphia, where it had shown its fruits.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Shute has arrived for the purpose of making the necessary preparations for the installation of the Colorado fruit exhibit.  The furniture is here and is being put in place.  The fruit will reach Omaha either Saturday or Sunday and the exhibit will be ready for inspection Monday morning.  Mr. Shute says that it will be one of the best exhibits in the building, as the fruit out in the state the he represents is unusually fine this year.</p>
                            <p>Oregon has made several additions to its horticultural exhibit and has the space assigned pretty well filled.  The fruit from that state is coming on in good shape and stands up well after its arrives and is placed upon the tables.  The latest additions to the exhibit consist of pears, Hungarian, Italian and peach plums.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska put eight barrels of old apples upon the tables yesterday and the perfect condition of the fruit was something that proved a great surprise.  Of course they came out of cold storage, but they were as sound and perfect as though just picked from the trees.  Another thing that surprised visitors at the Horticultural building was the fresh cherries.  It was supposed that cherries were out of the market nearly a month ago, but they are still here and are being exhibited by Nebraska, but by no other state.  Superintendent Youngers says that he will be able to show cherries for at least ten days longer.</p>
                            <p>Douglas county keeps right on piling up the grapes and peaches.  There does not seem to be any end to the supply, and with good luck Superintendent Walker says that he will show Douglas county peaches on the last day of the exposition.  Luck or no luck, he says that he will have grapes at that time and lots of them, too.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sacs and Foxes and Poncas from the Oklahoma Agencies Are Here.</head>
                            <p>The Indian congress was reinforced last night by the arrival of upward of 100 additional braves from the Ponca and Sac and Fox agencies, and other parties will arrive constantly during the next few days.  A large party of Kickapoos that were scheduled to appear last night were delayed on the road, but will be here before the end of the week.  Captain Mercer is also expecting a number of other additions, including some of the Northern Cheyennes, Pueblos and additional tribes of Sioux, and by September 10 the aboriginal population of the camp will be increased by fully 400.  Then the congress will be in full blast and Captain Mercer has arranged to make it a big feature during the last two months of the show.  The camp will be enlarged to accommodate that large additional number of tribes, and it will be extended in the direction of the Midway so the interior of the camp will be visible from Twentieth street.  With the assistance of the new arrivals a more elaborate program of dances and sports will be put on every day, and there will always be some interesting feature to amuse exposition visitors.  So far it has been impossible to carry out any set program as the Indians steadfastly decline to dance unless they feel like it, but when there are 600 or 700 of them to draw on this difficulty will be easily remedied.</p>
                            <p>Last night the Wild West show proved more attractive to the bucks than the usual evening dance, and the bulk of the encampment filed off after supper to see Colonel Cody's performance.  Even the new arrivals <choice><sic>joind</sic><corr>joined</corr></choice> the crowd without even waiting to put up their tepees and less than a score of Omahas and Winnebagoes remained to participate in the dance.  As this was a purely social affair it lacked the excitement of some of the big dances that usually occupy the evening.  But it was highly entertaining to several hundred people who congregated around the camp fires and caught their first glimpse of a genuine aboriginal festivity.</p>

                            <head type="sub">August Scoring Shows This Result and Pleases the People.</head>
                            <p>Minnesota people who are here looking after the state's interests at the exposition are in high feather over the August butter scoring contest, which was concluded yesterday.  W. D. Collyer, the butter expert from Chicago, completed his work yesterday afternoon and left for home last night.  In reaching his conclusions, he gave the highest award on creamery butter to E. J. Borke of Owatonna, the marking being 98 per cent.  The second highest exhibitor was Sam Hangdahl of New Sweden.  In the dairy class the highest competitor was Harvey Johnson, Logan, Ia.; second, Mrs. J. H. McRostie, Owatonna.</p>
                            <p>In the contest butter scoring less than 95 per cent was not considered.  Everything scoring above that point will be entitled to a gold medal at the close of the exposition.  Yesterday's contest was the second of the season.  There will be three more before the exposition closes.  At the last scoring prior to yesterday, Iowa won.</p>
                            <p>Those who came out of yesterday's contest with a score of 95 or better are:  S. J. Bork, Steele Center; W. I. Noyes, Moland; C. Hansen, Young America; R. S. Bergsayther, Skyburg; Sam Haugdahl, New Sweden; C. J. Bangs, Blaine; H. T. Sonegard, Litchfield; R. T. O'Brien, St. Martins; George B. Parks, Mrs. J. H. McRostie, Owatonna; Aage Vind, Rochester; Tom Milton, St. Paul; Louis Jorgenson, Stewart, Minn.; Tonganoxie Creamery company, Tonganoxie, Kan.; William Gehrles, Germantown, Kan.; W. H. Smith, Sandwich, Ill.; F. H. Teetor, Wellsville, Kan.; R. T. McCall, Creston; John A. Turnbull, Louis Schack, Atlantic, Ia.; James Haire, Albion; Jerkin Hess, Newman Grove, Neb.: Harvey Johnson, Logan, Ia.; Heston Creamery company, Newton, Kan.; S. S. Merritt, Henry, Ill.; L. N. Moore, Fulton, Kan.; Meriden Creamery company, Meriden, Kan.; W. R. Wiggerton, Hustler, Kan.</p>
                            <p>In the Dairy building, Minnesota is preparing to put in a permanent exhibit.  The state will take space in the cases on the south side, where Mrs. McDonald will do some modeling.  Kansas people have taken hold and have also decided to place a permanent exhibit.  This will use up all of the space in the building.</p>
                            <p>The butter on exhibit and entered for the contest aggregated 2,500 pounds, and after the results of the scoring was announced, the whole lot was sold to one of the downtown grocers.</p>

                            <p>The prospects for an abundant supply of peaches on peach day&#8212;tomorrow&#8212;continue to grow brighter, and the indications are that unless there is an unusually large crowd there will be enough of the fruit to go around and give all a taste.  Uncle Bob Furnas has sent word that he will ship 150 cases and Russell of Wymore has served notice that he will be on hand with 300 cases.  Fruit growers of Utah and Missouri have telegraphed that they have sent consignments, but how many they do not state.</p>
                            <p>The baskets and crates of peaches will be stacked on the space reserved for Colorado, and will be given out as parties enter the building.  The doors will be thrown open at 8 o'clock in the morning and peaches will be given away as long as the supply lasts.  Superintendent Taylor of the Horticultural building desires to say that there will not be enough fruit to last all day, and for this reason, he advises people to come early and enter the grounds at the gates in the rear of the Georgia building on the Bluff tract.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Stanton of the Illinois fruit exhibit in the Horticultural building is running a life saving service of his own.  He made his first rescue yesterday afternoon, when he pulled a girl from the pool in front of the Horticulture building.</p>
                            <p>The pool in front of the Horticulture building on the Bluff tract is about four feet deep and is filled with aquatic plants, many of which have broad leaves.  Yesterday a man and his wife and a daughter were walking along the edge of the pool, when suddenly the daughter, a girl some 13 years of age, stepped out and planted one of her feet on the leaf of one of the plants.  Instantly the plant went down and so did the girl.  Superintendent Stanton, seeing the girl struggling in the water, jumped in, pulled her to the surface and handed her over to the parents, who had concluded that their daughter was certain of being drowned.</p>

                            <p>The big pipe organ that has stood in front of the auditorium of the Iowa state building is a thing of the past, so far as the exposition is concerned.  It was manufactured by a firm at Macon City and was sent here to be exhibited.  After being set up it was the intention to have concert music played upon the thing each morning and afternoon.  From the start the instrument refused to supply the desired music.  Half a dozen experts overhauled the thing until at last it was given up as a bad job.  Yesterday it was removed from the building and shipped back to the maker.  The space which it formerly occupied will be added to that now occupied by Miss Barber, the register clerk.</p>

                            <p>The record of admissions for the third month of the exposition shows a gratifying increase that fully realizes the expectations of the management.  The total attendance during August was 474,176, or an average of 15,296 daily.  In June the total attendance was 289,351, or daily 9,463 daily, and in July it was 231,684, or 10,699 per day.  The aggregate increase in July over June was 42,333 admissions, while the increase in August over that of July was 142,492.  This is an increase of almost exactly 40 per cent and its continuance during the next thirty days will mean 700,000 admissions during September.</p>

In the evening they were tendered a reception at the Japanese tea garden by the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and this was a very enjoyable conclusion of a pleasant holiday.  The reception continued from 7 to 8:30 o'clock and during this time the fraternities had the pretty resort to themselves.  It was prettily decorated in the Kappa colors and light refreshments were served by the local society.</p>

                            <p>Sunshine, sunshades and sunflowers seem to satisfy the street strollers today.  It is Kansas day at the Transmississippi Exposition and over 2,000 sons and daughters of the neighboring state are on hand to take part in the celebration.  They are Jayhawkers in name only and they say that have no kick coming on anything.  Good crops this season, good weather for their excursion and a good time at the exposition <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The Missouri Pacific brought in the biggest crowd of Kansans.  Train No. 1 arrived at 6 o'clock this morning with eight cars well filled with delegations of the visitors from the adjoining state.  It was too early in the day to stop at the exposition grounds, so the excursionists came into the Webster street station.  They were followed in about fifteen minutes by a special train from Winfield, Kan., and this was filled with 400 excursionists from that town and intermediate points in Kansas and Nebraska.  The special train was in charge of E. E. Blockley, passenger agent of the Missouri Pacific at Wichita, Kan.  The Rock Island's morning train from Kansas had several additional coaches attached to it, and on account of the heavy travel came in about half an hour late.  The Burlington road brought in about 300 Kansans on Wednesday afternoon on train No. 2.</p>
                            <p>The mecca for all the folks from the Sunflower state was the exposition grounds, and they didn't lose much time in getting out there.  Those who came in on the early morning trains of the Missouri Pacific railroad had a couple of hours to spend down town before the gates opened, and this time was put in securing breakfast and looking about town.  The other Kansans put in some time down town, stopped at the railroad offices long enough to make sure of their return trains, and then made a bolt for the exposition grounds.  By noon there was scarcely any one of them to be seen down town, although the principal business streets wore the usual animated appearance and were crowded with visitors and citizens all day long.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Passenger travel in and out of Omaha at present is so heavy that nearly all of the lines are experiencing some difficulty in providing the necessary equipment.  During the last week there has been scarcely a day that the passenger departments of the Omaha roads have not seen after the operating departments to secure more cars.  A great number of the exposition visitors are taking trips through various portions of the surrounding country after seeing the big show, and the result is that there is a heavy movement both in and out of the city.  More people are seen at the Tenth street depots now at midnight than during the afternoons a year ago, and the afternoon crowds now are something without parallel.</p>
                            <p>Many of the lines have been forced to run their principal trains in two or more sections for several days, and some of the lines are making arrangements to place additional trains on their regular schedules till the close of the exposition.  On account of the heavy travel to and from the west the Burlington has just decided to put on another train between Omaha and Lincoln.  It makes its first run September 1.  It leaves Lincoln at 1:30 p. m. daily, arriving here at 3:15 p. m.  Returning it leaves Omaha at 5 p. m. and arrives at Lincoln at 6:15 p. m.  It is designed to help look after travel from the Billings branch line and from points about Lincoln.  The train from Billings arrives at Lincoln at 1 p. m. and the new train pulls out for Omaha fifteen minutes later.</p>

                            <p>On Wednesday afternoon the Burlington took out of here one of the longest passenger trains seen about here lately.  It was made up of two locomotives and nineteen cars, and even then seats were at a premium.  For over a week the Union Pacific Northwestern and Burlington have been running trains of from fourteen to sixteen cars each.  The business of the Milwaukee has improved so that another regular Chicago-Omaha sleeper has been added to its express.  The Rock Island trains have been running heavy, and some excursions to the exposition that were contemplated have had to be postponed for awhile owing to the scarcity of passenger equipment.  The operating department of the Burlington has requested the passenger department of that road not to arrange any more big excursions until it can secure more cars for use in and out of Omaha.  The Missouri Pacific is also short on passenger equipment, cars being in demand for hauling troops home from St. Louis and more being needed to bring the people to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>With passenger travel as heavy as it has been for the last few days railroaders are wondering what it will be when the lower rates, effective from September 1 to November 1, become widely advertised.  Most of them think that it is simply a question of supplying cars enough to handle the crowds, and the very officials who six months ago laughed at the idea of their equipment being taxed are jumping around the liveliest now to get hold of cars to carry the people.</p>

                            <p>The outlook for heavy travel on western lines into Omaha on account of the celebration of some state days this month is exceedingly bright.  General Passenger Agent Lomax of the Union Pacific says:  "While it is difficult to tell just what amount of travel there will be on any special occasion until it is close at hand, the reports so far received indicate that we will handle big crowds on Colorado, Utah and Wyoming days at the exposition.  Colorado day especially is going to be big and we are pushing all three hard."</p>
                            <p>Assistant General Passenger Agent Hutchison of the same road has just returned from a western trip.  He devoted a great deal of time to seeing that Wyoming day, which will be celebrated on September 19, is widely advertised.  He says:  "We have exposition advertising matter not only at all points along our line in Wyoming, but have pretty well covered all the stage routes.  We have sent bundles of exposition literature over into the mining camps, forty and fifty miles back from the railroad, and have no doubt about getting a big crowd from Wyoming.  I think we'll have enough Wyoming people to fill a couple of special trains in addition to the regular trains."</p>
                            <p>Only a fair crowd is anticipated by the railroad men on Montana day, September 6, but one of the largest parties of the season is confidently predicted from Colorado on the special day of the Centennial state, September 9.  Colorado has been thoroughly covered by advertising matter by all lines, and the roads have agreed on a round trip rate of $10.80.  It is also thought that Utah day at the exposition, September 14, will be recorded as one of the successes of the series of state days.  It's a long trip from the land of the Mormons, but the railroads have put in a round trip rate of $25, and the passenger men out there are booming the occasion in a lively manner.</p>

A full attendance of society people is now assured and it is hoped that all citizens or guests of Omaha will don fancy costumes and participate in the fun.

                            <p>It has been decided to admit gentlemen to the parade in evening dress or mask, if accompanied by a woman in fancy costume.  Those participating in the parade will assemble at the Auditorium at 8 o'clock.  Attendants will be in charge of the dressing rooms, and every effort will be made to look after wraps, etc., of the maskers.  All people in fancy costumes will be admitted at the gate next the Auditorium for 25 cents.  A special gate keeper will be detailed at this point to admit the maskers.</p>
                            <p>All are asked to bring flowers for throwing during the battle of confetti.  The line of march will be as follows:  North from the Auditorium, past the Electrical and Manufactures buildings, across the bridge and past the Art building to the Government building, where a roped-off space will be provided for the exercises.  The Mexican band will furnish the dance music for the occasion.</p>

                            <head type="main">ART AT THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>It is unfortunate that the imposing south entrance, which was designed by the architects in chief to be the main entrance into the exposition, should be the one with which the public is least familiar.  But the street car route&#8212;which is as unstable as the Missouri river&#8212;was deflected from its straight and narrow course and the people who are dependent upon the street cars as a means of transportation are left at the back door on Twenty-fourth street or at the subway entrance on Sherman avenue.</p>
                            <p>The Brandenburg gate&#8212;that magnificent triumphal monument which forms the entrance to the city of Berlin from the Thiergarten&#8212;has the central passage reserved for the carriages of royalty to pass through.  If this Arch of States had been designed to allow a certain class only to enter under its proud arch, what a crowding and pushing there would be to pass through that way!  As it is, there are probably fewer people enter at the main entrance than at any of the other gates.</p>
                            <p>It really repays one to leave the car at Witt street, walk over to Twentieth street and enter the exposition grounds under the lofty Arch of States.</p>
                            <p>As you approach the main entrance you must close your eyes to all the mean and common looking, unpainted pine building erected as check stands, stables and <choice><sic>restauruats</sic><corr>restaurants</corr></choice>, which seem fastened to each side of the arch like barnacles to a stately white ship.  The general effect of this triumphal arch is unquestionably majestic, the relative proportions are happily determined and the dominant architectural lines are specially commendable.  Near the top is a frieze formed of the seals of the transmississippi states and in the middle above the frieze are two youths upholding the shield of the United States.</p>
                            <p>This offers a worthy entrance to the beautiful lagoon court and the classic buildings which encircle it.</p>
                            <p>The arch is flanked on each side by wings, curving out toward the town like arms hospitably outstretched to all.  In these wings are the booths for the ticket sellers and each wing is crowned at the end by a group of four crouching female figures, holding out toward the four points of the compass the lighted torch of knowledge&#8212;which one finds within the gates.  The statuary, simple though it is, is appropriate in design and is in good proportion with reference to the whole.  It is the work of the sculptor, Mr. Bringhurst of St. Louis, who also did the sculpture work on the Art building.</p>
                            <p>Passing in under the monumental arch, seventy feet high, one discovers opposite, on the other side of the bridge, another arch&#8212;equally adequate&#8212;of the Administration building.  Unconsciously one feels how nicely <choice><sic>theese</sic><corr>these</corr></choice> two arches balance one another and at the same time accent the short axis of the lagoon court by rising as they do high above the larger buildings.</p>
                            <p>The Administration Arch, with its classic arch below, a loggia above and high, steep-pitched roof, with a lantern and corner <choice><sic>pinacles</sic><corr>pinnacles</corr></choice>, is very striking and differentiates itself from all the other buildings.  Although it, too, is designed in the renaissance style and is in harmony with its neighbors, it is different in character and recalls some of the mediaeval gateways to old French towns, or some of the towers which one occasionally sees in northern France&#8212;the tour d'horloge at Rouen, for example.  It is the central feature of the north side of the lagoon court, and with its green roof, ribbed with gold, and pinnacles in green and gold it is very effective and adds a bit of color to the architectural scheme.  The vaulted ceiling of the first story over the archway, pierced by the four principal arches, is brilliantly lighted at night by electric lights which droop like luminous pistils in the dainty flower-like rosettes.</p>
                            <p>The statuary by Mr. Metler of New York is so distributed as to give effect to the whole.  The general character of the building is reflected back in each detail and in these groups and figures the sculptor has not tied to induce himself upon the public by making his work predominant, but rather by the aid of the plastic art he participates in the architectural forms.  There is no other means of habituating the public to the beautiful and making it loved by them, but by presenting beautiful forms as the expression of an idea which arrests their thoughts, engages and interests them.</p>
                            <p>Architecture is, as a certain poet has said, "a book in stone;" then the sculpture must be the illustrations.  In this case the embodiment of the administrative idea is carefully carried out.  The lower part of the Administration Arch, with its Roman arch and its simplicity, suggests strength and power; the upper part&#8212;with the very pointed roof and pinnacles&#8212;lifts the thoughts above the petty cares which sometimes creep in to disturb the peace of mind of an administrative board.  The same idea is again made visible in the central sculptured group above the loggia where the genius of administration is calmly seated, waited upon by two youths.</p>
                            <p>The Administration Arch and the Arch of States were designed by the architects in chief, Messrs. Walker and Kimball of Boston and Omaha, who with such excellent taste designed the general scheme of the lagoon court and one of the most pleasing of all the architectural features&#8212;the colonnades.  They gave to the architects the scale and general style of all the buildings, thus foreordaining the clearness and harmony which delights us without out knowing why.  We cannot but regret that in a short time our "Enchanted City" will be a "City of Dreams."  Still the shortness of its life does not diminish the value<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The sun began to pour down hot yesterday as hot as <choice><sic>o nany</sic><corr>on any</corr></choice> day recently, but people on the exposition grounds felt that, after all, they were in the shade of an enormous sunflower of as great an expanse as the state of Kansas, for it was Kansas day.</p>
                            <p>And the state flower bloomed from thousands of coats and dresses.  It was now in the form of a button and now the real thing, for it is the sunflower season.</p>
                            <p>The Kansas commissioners met the speakers, the band and the quartet of the occasion, at the Iler Grand early in the morning and at 10 o'clock escorted them and exposition officials to the grounds in carriages.</p>
                            <p>Meantime many hundreds of Kansas people had passed through the gates.  The Missouri Pacific train arriving at 6 o'clock had thirteen coaches, all crowded, and a special from Lincoln three hours later had a large company aboard.</p>
                            <p>The procession from down town to the grounds was headed by Caman's Military band of Winfield, Kas., and arrived at the Auditorium soon after 11 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>The audience filled the lower part of the building.</p>
                            <p>Vice President Frost of the Kansas commission presided.  The exercises opened with a selection by Caman's band, followed by prayer by Bishop Millspaugh and a song by the McPherson quintet, composed of Messrs. J. W. Smith, E. R. Falgren, G. H. Kittell, Fred B. Clarke and Carl P. Miller.  The song was followed by an encore.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOVERNOR HOLCOMB'S WELCOME.</head>
                            <p>Governor Holcomb welcomed the visitors for the state.  He said that he felt sure that a way had been prepared for the Kansans to come to the exposition, for in a recent railway trip he had noticed on either side of the track from Kansas to Lincoln and from Lincoln to Omaha a dense growth of sunflowers.  They had, he imagined, been planted by fairies, so that the <unclear reason="torn"/>oining from Kansas should be <unclear reason="torn"/>ed and not feel lonesome and <unclear reason="torn"/> to return.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the interwoven history of Kansas and Nebraska, beginning with the proposition that they should settle their own domestic affairs in their own way, Governor Holcomb said that the people of both commonwealths had been in the habit of doing about as they pleased, being bold, intelligent and industrious.  The two states were more clearly allied historically than any other two in the union and their populations were more nearly alike.  What was to be seen at the exposition was but an evidence of what was to be expected in the future.</p>

                            <p>In the enforced absence of Governor Leedy of Kansas on account of sickness, response was made by ex-Governor Glick, the president of the state commission.  His address was a eulogy of his state.  He referred to the 12,000 school houses and the 1,200 churches in Kansas as showing the God-fearing and culture-loving character of the population.  He mentioned the achievements of his people in agriculture and commerce to show their devotion to the vocations of peace and to their achievements in arms, to show their devotion to the common country in peril.  Kansans, he said, could be depended on to build up a great state for themselves and contribute their share to the prosperity and glory of the whole country.</p>

                            <p>Following another selection by the McPherson quintet, an address was delivered by President Wattles of ht exposition.  It was short.  It was a greeting and dealt largely with respect to the resources of Kansas.</p>
                            <p>Thomas E. Will, president of the Kansas State Agricultural college, followed with an address on "Higher Education in Kansas."  It was a description of the educational spirit and methods of his state, whose efficacy has been attested by the character of the population.</p>
                            <p>The program closed with brief addresses by C. B. Hoffman and A. W. <unclear reason="torn"/>n, with selections by the band and </p>

                            <p>This is Kansas day at the exposition, and the city is full of Kansans, all wearing the familiar Sunflower button, and a large badge.  Some of the prominent people came in Wednesday, but the early morning trains brought in large numbers of people.  There were three trains on the Missouri Pacific, one at 7 a. m., and the other a half hour later.  These two trains brought in at least 1,000 passengers, and the noon train brought 500 or 600 more.  Large numbers came over the Burlington also, and Secretary Greef of the state commission says there are 1,500 or 2,000 Kansans in the city.</p>
                            <p>Governor Leedy is not present, being ill at Hutchinson, and Eugene Ware, the Kansas orator and poet, who was to deliver the address today, telegraphed that he could not come, being detained at home by pressing business.</p>
                            <p>Among the prominent people present are Right Rev. Frank R. Millpaugh, Protestant Episcopal bishop of Kansas; President Will of the state agricultural college, C. B. Hoffman and A. W. Smith, and Commissioners George W. Glick, John E. First, A. C. Lambe and A. H. Greef.  The Iler Grand is headquarters for the Kansas official party.  The hotel lobby was filled this morning with callers, and among those present was Governor Holcomb, who was a center of interest, and in demand, the Kansans being especially interested in seeing Nebraska's popular governor.</p>
                            <p>At 11 o'clock the official party left the hotel for the corner of Fourteenth and Harney where two trains of street cars were in waiting to take them to the exposition.  In addition to the officials of Kansas, the state and commissioners, there were fully fifty or more men prominent in Kansas and Nebraska political life in the cars.</p>

                            <p>The scoring of the butter exhibits in the Dairy building was completed Wednesday by W. D. Collyer of Chicago.  This scoring was for the August exhibits and those scoring above 95 points are entitled, under the rules of the exposition, to a diploma.

                            <p>James A. Harris of Owatona, Minn., superintendent of the Minnesota exhibit in the Dairy building, has gone home for a short visit.</p>
                            <p>The Minnesota dairy exhibit is to be improved by a butter exhibit which will be permanent in its nature and Mrs. McDonald of Minnesota is here for the purpose of modelling in butter in one of the refrigerators in the Dairy building in plain view of spectators.</p>
                            <p>Hayden Bros. bought all the butter that scored high and have put it on sale at their store.</p>

                            <p>The committee appointed by the exposition management to extend to President McKinley the official invitation to be present and participate in the Peace jubilee celebration at Omaha will have an audience with the president at the White house Wednesday morning of next week.  Arrangements for this meeting have been made by the private secretary of Senator Hanna and the majority of the committee will leave Omaha Saturday of this week.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston and General Cowin will start for New York this evening to attend to a business matter in which both are interested and they will meet the others of the committee in Washington Wednesday.  There is some doubt as to Senator Thurston being able to join the committee in calling upon the president, as he is due to appear before the meeting of the Grand Army of the Republic at Cincinnati Wednesday on business connected with the Sons of Veterans&#8212;he having been appointed a committee of one for that purpose.  He may be able to defer this matter until the following day, in which event he will be able to act with the committee.</p>
                            <p>In addition to Senator Thurston and General Cowin, the committee includes Congressman Mercer, John L. Webster and J. C. Wharton.  Colonel E. C. Snyder, Senator Thurston's secretary, will accompany the last named members of the committee to Washington.</p>

                            <p>Another big crowd is filling the exposition grounds and the indications are that the attendance of yesterday will be reached and possibly exceeded prior to the closing of the gates tonight.  All day long there has been a steady stream of humanity through the turnstiles and at times the ticket sellers have been unable to handle the rush.  The crowd commenced to come early and there was not let up during the entire day.  There is not a long list of attractions for the day, but for the evening there is the Mask carnival along the shores of the Lagoon, which is expected to draw thousands out from the city and the surrounding towns.</p>
                            <note type="handwritten">Peaches Etc.</note>
                            <p>It is Nebraska Peach and Pottawattamie County Grape day and this is sufficient to pack the Bluff tract from one end to the other with those who are anxious to secure a taste of fruit raised in this section of the country, that they may compare flavor and quality with that which comes from the south, east and west.  The peaches were given out at the Horticulture building and there were an abundance for all who came.
                            
                            <pb n="134" xml:id="TMISB06-134"/>
                            
                            Something like 1,000 baskets had been sent in by the fruit growers of the state and when the visitors entered the building, they saw the tables covered and the fruit piled almost ceiling high.  The guards kept the crowd back and compelled the visitors to pass between tables, from which Superintendent Younger and his assistants distributed fruit with a lavish hand.  All day long the procession passed along, accepting the gift of the state and still there are enough peaches left to feed a multitude.</p>
                            <p>While there was a crowd at the distribution of peaches, there was one almost as large at the Pottawattamie County Wigwam, where Grape day was being observed.  Here the tables were covered with the fruit, which was given away by Superintendent Graham and his assistants.  Tons and tons of grapes had been sent in by the growers on the Iowa side of the river, many of whom were present to give points upon fruit growing in this section and also to convince the public that it is not necessary to go away from the river states to produce the best that the country affords.</p>
                            <p>Several large excursions entered the grounds during the day, notably the National Press association and the Minneapolis Journal excursion, which had something to do with swelling the attendance for the day.</p>
                            <p>The band concerts were largely attended and the music was well received and frequently applauded, while the amusement features of the exposition caught large and enthusiastic crowds.</p>

                            <p>Eleven Pullman cars carrying the eastern and southern delegates to the convention of the National Press association, which meets at Denver next week, were switched on the Missouri Pacific tracks near the grounds this forenoon.  They carried 400 people consisting exclusively of editors and their wives, who will spend the remainder of the week in seeing the transmississippi show.  The train arrived on the Burlington at 8:30 this morning and was landed at the grounds about 10 o'clock.  The visitors were received by Superintendent Richardson of the Press building and provided with passes and other courtesies that were essential to their enjoyment.  Most of the party called at the Press building before beginning their sightseeing excursions and after a short rest they separated into small parties to make the tour of the grounds.  They had seen but a small portion of the attractions of the exposition this forenoon, but these were enough to make them its enthusiastic admirers.  They will remain in their special cars during their stay and will leave for Denver at 9:30 Sunday morning.</p>

                            <p>William Livingood, telegraph editor of the Los Angeles Times, accompanied by his wife and daughter, called at the Los Angeles exhibit in the Horticultural building yesterday and spent the day with Superintendent Wilson.  Mr. Livingood was delighted with the exposition and said it is much better than he expected to find it.  The exhibits in the Horticultural building he considers exceedingly fine, the fruit showing up about as well as that raised in the semi-tropical climate of southern California.</p>

                            <p>The Leader-Democrat of Springfield, Mo., has some prize girls and they will all be in Omaha next week for the purpose of enjoying an outing at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Some weeks ago Editor J. B. Jewell of the Leader-Democrat worked up a voting scheme for the purpose of ascertaining the popularity of the young women of the town.  The five most popular ones he promised free transportation to Omaha, board for a week at a first class hotel and passes to the exposition during their stay in town.  Then the fun commenced and continued until Monday, when time was called.  In figuring up results it was ascertained that Misses Ella Ashworth, Emma Hunt, May Malone, Kittie Evans and Mrs. George E. Preston has won.  This word was conveyed to Secretary Wakefield of the exposition, who yesterday forwarded the exposition passes to the editor to be delivered to the young women.  There was another young woman who came within 200 votes or such a matter of being a winner.  She is a Miss Maude McLean, and while it is possible that she may not come as the guest of the paper she will have a pass to the exposition grounds.  Along with the other passes Secretary Wakefield sent one for this young woman, requesting that she accept it as a courtesy from the exposition.  The young women expect to reach Omaha next Tuesday.  They will be chaperoned by Miss Ora Cassity, who is connected with the Leader-Democrat.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Realistic Fire Fighting to Be Part of the Program.</head>
                            <p>On the large level space just north of the Belt Line tracks a big force of carpenters and graders are rapidly preparing for the reception of the National Firemen's tournament, which will be the principal feature of next week.  The entire tract has been graded as level as a floor and a commodious track has been laid out and rolled hard for the races that will be features of each day's program.</p>
                            <p>Along the south side a big grandstand that will seat 3,500 people is almost completed and at the other side of the enclosure are the various buildings that will be required during the tournament.  These consist of the fire tower, company quarters, three big stables for the horses and several large buildings of rough construction that will be set on fire to give the firemen an opportunity to display their skill in modern fire fighting.</p>
                            <p>While the tournament is in one respect an incidental feature of the exposition, the enclosure is entirely separate from the grounds.  This will permit people to attend the tournament without going to the exposition unless they want to, but exposition visitors will have to pay for admission to the tournament like anyone else.  The two attractions are not scheduled for one admission.</p>
                            <p>The tournament will begin Monday morning and continue all through the week.  While it is impossible to forecast the exact number of companies that will participate, it is announced that there is no doubt it will be the biggest event of the kind that has ever been held in the United States.  The prizes that are offered in the various competitions will aggregate $10,000 and these are sufficient to enlist the interest of all the crack organizations in the country.  Very low railroad rates have been given for uniformed companies and many of them will be able to pay the entire expenses of their trip with the prize money that they win.</p>
                            <p>The program for the week offers a wide field of novel and exciting amusement.  The competition of the crack hose companies in laying hose, coupling and quick runs will furnish sport of the most exciting description and it is expected that many a record that has stood for years will be shattered during the tournament.</p>
                            <p>One of the most interesting features of the tournament will be the exhibitions of actual fire fighting, which will be remarkably realistic and exciting enough to rouse the blood of the spectators.  The visitors will be given actual spectacles of fire fighting, involving the use of every sort of modern apparatus, and the rescue of imprisoned inmates from burning buildings.  The buildings that are to be sacrificed for this purpose are three stories high, and while they are not deep, they present a good sized elevation on the side that faces the grandstand.  They are built of wood throughout and will furnish a thorough test of the abil-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>At intervals during the tournament one of these buildings will break into flames.  Then every detail of a genuine conflagration will follow.  The alarm will be given and at the stroke of the gong the firemen will dash to the spot with the apparatus.  Hose will be laid and couplings made with the utmost rapidity and precision that human skill can produce, and the firemen will fight the flames as desperately as though they menaced the safety of half a city.  Just as the entire building is enveloped in smoke and flame half a dozen frantic people will appear at the third story windows and clamor for assistance.  Then the life saving apparatus will come in play and the firemen will show how it is used.  The whole proceeding will be perfectly genuine and will be as interesting to the spectators as though it had not been carefully planned beforehand.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Thousands Take Advantage of the Special Rate to See Big Program.</head>
                            <p>The 25-cent admission, a cool breeze blowing across the lagoon, two band concerts, the exhibition given by the United States life saving crew, special fireworks and the attractions at the Indian village were some of the attractions that drew an immense crowd to the exposition grounds last night.  The 25-cent admission rate became effective at 6 o'clock and for the two hours following every car leading to the grounds was crowded to the foot boards.  Hundreds walked to the gates, where there was a jam, such as has seldom been seen.</p>
                            <note type="handwritten">Kansas</note>
                            <p>The <del>work</del><add>Exhibition</add> of the life saving crew at night was something not heretofore seen on the lagoon and it proved a great card as a drawer.  Every inch of space along the viaduct rail from the bridge down to the Government building was occupied.  The shot fired over the spar carried the rope just where it was intended.  The shipwrecked crew was saved and carried in safety to the shore.  The swamping of the boat elicited loud cheers and the entire program was enjoyed hugely by those who witnessed it.  Many regarded it even more interesting than when conducted during the afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The fireworks on the north tract were special for Kansas day and were witnessed by a crowd that occupied every seat in the grand stand.  Although he had not been given much time in which to manufacture the fireworks, John Due, chief of pyrotechnics, set out and completed what by many was considered the best display since the opening of the exposition.  The set pieces were Governor Leedy in colored fire, "Welcome Kansas," the man pushing the barrow, "Yankee Doodle," a zig zag design, revolving planets, a spiral wheel in four colors intersected by thirty-six inch scrolls with revolving wheels at the back of each.  Then there were 100 fountains with fifty stars each.  Rockets and bombs were much as have been heretofore exploded, with the exception that there were a number of double shells, throwing gold and silver fire.  The red in the rockets was unusually fine and of a much deeper hue, the color remaining until it reached the earth.</p>
                            <p>After the fireworks about everybody seemed to visit the Midway <del>and all of the concessionaires did a good business</del> until the hour for closing.</p>
                            <p>The Indians had their usual dance, but there were so many other things to attract attention that few people visited the camp.  The dance was in the nature of a friendly gathering and was participated in by the Crows, Sioux and Assiniboines.</p>

                            <p>A movement has been started by a number of prominent members of the Grand Army of the Republic to have a Grand Army week in October at the exposition.  Several of them met together last night and talked the thing over with the result that it was resolved to call upon State Department Commander Majors to invite the posts generally to participate in an encampment here from October 10 to 15 and an invitation is to be sent to General Gobin, national department commander, and through him calling upon ex-union soldiers of the country generally to pay Omaha a visit and take part in a mammoth Grand Army of the Republic demonstration.</p>
                            <p>It is believed no time could be more propitious for a grand reunion of old veterans than now as the magnificent record of the administration in the late war with Spain and the happy termination of this most recent conflict afford reason for an enthusiastic gathering.</p>

Lewis &amp; Co. of Waterloo, Ia., who will put in an exhibit consisting of supplies and tools used in the cultivation of bees and the handling of the honey.  The building is more completely filled than the Apiary buildings at any of the former expositions and the exhibits are said to be of a better class.</p>
                            <p>The honey in the Apiary building is admired by all who visit the structure.  While it has been an off year for bees, owing to the extreme heat and the wet weather during the early part of the season, the honey is excellent and is said to be as fine as any every placed on exhibit.</p>

Wednesday is Galesburg and Port Arthur day and Friday is Colorado, Woodmen of the World, Hoo Hoo and Lumbermen's day.</p>
                            <p>A largely attended concert was given at the Kansas state building this afternoon, the Winfield band and a quartet furnishing the music.  Most of the Kansas people are on the exposition grounds today.  They are all pleased with the exposition and many of them will remain until next week.</p>
                            <p>The members of the National Editorial association will be on the exposition grounds tonight and will meet at the Illinois state building on the Bluff tract at 9 o'clock, where a reception will be held.

                            <p>A notable party were enjoying a ride in the electric carriage of Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. yesterday.  Admiral Brown, a real live admiral of the United States navy exhibit at Omaha exposition, a representative of Winchester Arms company and a representative of Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.  Men of this character make very little show of themselves therefore the crowd about knew nothing of their identity.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday General Manager Clarkson extended a formal invitation to the concessionaires and their wives to participate in the masked carnival in the main court tonight.  This event has inspired more than ordinary local interest and its success is regarded as assured.  People in evening dress or costume who wish to participate in the parade will be admitted at the Auditorium gate for 25 cents and the maskers will leave that building as promptly as possible after 8 o'clock.</p>

It is said to have been a mistake on the part of the San Francisco officials to permit the Chinamen to land, and as they came to Omaha without previous knowledge on the part of the officials here, they would not be received.  The Celestials have been corralled during the last week, but will now be turned over to a concessionaire at the exposition.

                            <p>B. D. Caldwell, chairman of the Western Passenger association, has addressed a confidential note to each of the general passenger agents of the lines represented in the association asking them to the rescue of the association and to do all in their power to avert its threatened disruption.</p>
                            <p>The action of the Omaha terminal lines in taking independent action of the association when that body declined to grant reasonable rates to this city during the last two months of the exposition has had a deleterious effect on the association, and the chairman appears to be worried about its further usefulness.  The independent move of the Alton to place Kansas City on the same basis with Omaha during the rest of the exposition has also served to weaken the association.  And then appears as a certain climax the formation of the Transmissouri Passenger association, which will take the territory west of the Missouri river out of the control of the Western Passenger association and diminish at least Mr. Caldwell's authority.</p>
                            <p>The committee charged with drawing up the agreement on which the new association for the transmissouri territory will be formed has not yet made its report, and it is presumed has not completed its task.  The committee consists of General Passenger Agents Lomax of the Union Pacific, Francis of the B. &amp; M. and Buchanan of the Elkhorn.  As a majority of the committee represent railroad systems directed from Chicago, it is not believed the agreement for the new association will be radically opposed to the Western Passenger association.  It is now thought that the latter association, which is practically non-active now and is likely to be for a couple of months, will be entirely reorganized after November 1.</p>

                            <p>S. J. Ellison, district passenger agent of the Great Northern railway at Des Moines, Ia., is in the city to see the exposition.  He considers the showing so far made as something wonderful, and predicts an enormous attendance during the remaining two months.  He bases his belief on the opinions he has heard expressed in the territory through which he travels.</p>
                            <p>In speaking of the passenger traffic on his own line Mr. Ellison says:  "Travel on the Great Northern has been very good this summer, but it has been moved at such ridiculously low rates that there is little or no revenue in it.  With a rate of $10 from the Missouri river to Portland it can hardly be expected that the passenger department is going to earn a mint of money.  Of course this is the second class rate, but then a large share of the business is moving in that class.  Klondike business has about dropped to nil, and so far as I can learn the $10 rates did more to hurt it than to help it."</p>

On account of the reduced rate made for Kansas day at the exposition 2,656 passengers were brought in on the trains of that road alone, or about three times the number that were expected.

There were exactly 100 excursionists in the party, and they filled two sleeping cars and one first-class passenger coach on the morning express of the Rock Island road.  The cars were decorated with large banners suspended from the windows informing the public that the party was under the auspices of the Minneapolis Journal and was headed for the transmississippi exposition at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The visitors were met at the union depot by General Manager Clarkson of the exposition and Special Advertising Agent McGarvie of the Department of Publicity and Promotion.  Frank Beech, traveling passenger agent of the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis railroad, and A. W.

A number of the excursionists went directly to the exposition grounds, but most of them proceeded to the headquarters of the party at the Dellone hotel, and took lunch there before going out to the big show.</p>
                            <p>Some of the party will leave for home over the Rock Island route at 5 o'clock on Saturday evening, but as the tickets of all are good for use until Monday night, many of the visitors will stay longer at the exposition.  This is the twenty-seventh excursion run by the Minneapolis Journal in the last five years, and during that time 11,296 persons have been given trips through various parts of the country.</p>

                            <p>During August the floating indebtedness of the exposition was reduced $122,623.17.  The balance now standing against the association exclusive of the expenditure that has been ordered for the Firemen's tournament and the Live Stock show is $57,834.40 as compared to $180,457.57 a month ago.  At the beginning of August the floating indebtedness of the association was distributed as follows:  Warrants outstanding, $32,360.44; bills payable, $45,112.91; balances on contracts, $71,499.37; overdraft on treasurer, $31,484.85; total $180,457.57.  Since that time the warrants outstanding have been cut down over $20,000.  More than 50 per cent of the contract balances and bills have been taken up and the overdraft on the treasurer has been wiped out.  The record now stands:  Warrants, $12,242.28; bills payable, $20,680.03; contract balances, $32,777.62; current bills, (estimated), $7,500. total, $73,199.93; less $15,365.53, cash on hand, $57,834.40.</p>
                            <p>A large proportion of the visitors who have been in the city during the week left last night and this morning in order to get home before Sunday, and the result was a rather light attendance this forenoon.  There is nothing in particular to induce people to remain who had already seen the permanent features of the show and the local attendance is largely reserved for tonight, when the battle piece will be repeated by the McCook band.  This will be the last appearance of this organization and their farewell concert promises to be one of the best musical features of the week.  The McCook band will be followed by the Musical Union band of this city, which will play a two weeks' engagement.  There has been a continued demand from some quarters for a more general employment of local musicians and the two weeks' engagement will give the Omaha band a full opportunity to establish its claim to consideration.</p>
                            <p>The exercises and reception that were to have been held in the Auditorium this morning in recognition of Editor's day were called off at the last minute as the purpose had been practically served by the reception which occurred at the Illinois building last evening.  As this was not decided on until this morning, a large audience, including most of the visiting editors, assembled in the Auditorium and waited until it became apparent that no program was to be rendered.  They were entertained by an excellent <choice><sic>concrt</sic><corr>concert</corr></choice> by the Mexican band, which they seemed to consider ample compensation for the absence of more elaborate exercises.</p>
                            <p>The visit of the Second Nebraska volunteers next Wednesday will not be signalized by any elaborate speechmaking.  The management takes the position that the soldiers will not be inclined to listen to any long-winded speeches, as this will be the

                            first time that any of them have had an opportunity to see the exposition and the exercises of the the day will be brief and informal.  The regiment will enter the grounds through the north gate about 10:30 o'clock and will march through the Midways to the Horticulture building and then to the Plaza, where they will be massed in front of the band stand.  President Wattles will briefly bid them welcome and Colonel Bills will respond.  Then they will break ranks and the entire regiment will be dined at Markel's cafe.  After dinner the visitors will be left to their own resources in order that they may have an opportunity to enjoy the numerous attractions of the show.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Parade of the Maskers Around the Brilliantly Lighted Grand Court.</head>
                            <p>The carnival that was given last night by the women of the Bureau of Entertainment transformed the main court into a scene of enchanting beauty.  In addition to the electric illuminations, thousands of Japanese lanterns were stretched in a double circle around the lagoon and similar decorations threw a soft light over the water from the launches and gondolas that skimmed over its surface.  When the vast court was packed from end to end with thousands of people in which the fantastic costumes of the maskers were here and there perceptible like flowers in a somber landscape, the effect was bewilderingly beautiful.  The background of glistening greensward, the gorgeous foliage of the oleanders and the life and movement of the tremendous crowd contributed to make the scene a fantasie of light and color that charmed each sense alike.</p>
                            <p>Nearly everyone on the grounds was attracted to the court by the carnival ceremonies, and so dense was the crush that it was with difficulty that the prearranged program was carried out.  The maskers congregated in the Auditorium at 8 o'clock and a little later they were formed into line behind the McCook band by General Manager Clarkson, who acted as marshal, and Assistant Marshals Dudley Smith, W. G. Schriver and Harry Thomas.  Mr. and Mrs. Clement Chase headed the maskers, followed by the members of the Bureau of Entertainment, with their escorts, and then by the general crowd of visitors in mask.  There were several hundred of them altogether and the costumes comprised a variety of pretty and fantastic designs.  There were shepherds and flower girls and imps and clowns and a score of novel characters that were delightfully original.  Among these one of the most ingenious was that of R. S. Berlin, who had transformed himself into a huge sheaf of Nebraska wheat fully eight feet high, which seemed to move in the pageant independently of any living agency.  Officers of high degree with swords and top boots and resplendent with decorations escorted pretty peasant girls in the costumes of the Alps and the Tyrolean mountains, and princes in flowing robes and flowers walked side by side with gnomes and clowns in heathenish garb.  Altogether it was a very pretty spectacle, but it was but a feature in the grand ensemble of the court, which was more beautiful in its entirety than any of its features.</p>
                            <p>The fantastic <choice><sic>calvalcade</sic><corr>cavalcade</corr></choice> proceeded around the head of the lagoon, thence west to the bridge and across to the other side, on which it marched to the wide space in front of the Government building, which had been roped off for the exclusive use of the maskers.  But the crowd was so big and so enthusiastic that it swept over the ropes and interfered somewhat with the subsequent proceedings.  The battle of confetti furnished amusement for a few minutes and then the band played a selection of dance music while those who felt inclined danced on the wide brick pavement.  Then the pageant moved back to the head of the lagoon and broke up.</p>
                            <p>Most of the maskers went to the Illinois building, where a reception was tendered the Editorial association and dancing was indulged in.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contest for Lumbermen's Day is Developing Intense Interest.</head>
                            <p>The log rolling contest that will be one of the features of Lumberman's day, September 9, is developing a rivalry between a number of the big lumber firms of the northwest that promises to result in substantial benefit to the exposition.  It was necessary to go to Eau Claire, Minneapolis and other big lumber centers to secure experienced men to enter in this contest.  A number of the big firms will send one or more men each and each is naturally anxious that its men should win out.  A great deal of interest has been created in the prospective competition in this event and the local lumbermen have received assurance that a large number of people will come to Omaha in addition to the heavy representation of lumber dealers from Nebraska and adjacent states.  As Lumber-<unclear reason="torn"/>day and Colorado day, it is believed that it will be one of the biggest occasions of the exposition.  The railroads are assured of a big crowd from Colorado and the Woodmen expect to be represented by several thousand members of the order.  These special features, with the Firemen's tournament and the permanent features of the exposition, are expected to bring a crowd that will rival that of the Fourth of July.</p>
                            <p>The local committee in charge of the lumbermen's celebration has announced that the special meeting of the Nebraska Association of Lumber Dealers will be held at the Nebraska building at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  The log rolling contest will occur on the Mirror at 3 o'clock, the parade at 7:30, fireworks at 8:30 and the concatenation of Hoo Hoos at the Minnesota building at 9:09.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Antelope State Saves the Day After the Others All Back Out.</head>
                            <p>Nebraska got to the front yesterday and monopolized all of the honors that went with the observance of Peach day; that is, Nebraska was the only state that had peaches to give away.</p>
                            <note type="handwritten">Peach Day</note>
                            <p>Some weeks ago when it was proposed to have a Peach day at the exposition, a number of the transmississippi states proposed to come in and make it a great event.  They promised carloads of peaches and it was supposed that there would be any quantity of the fruit, each state contributing its share.  Nothing was known to the contrary until a few days ago when the representatives of the several states commenced to serve notice upon the exposition managers that it would be impossible to furnish the peaches.  This information was conveyed to Superintendent Taylor of the Horticultural building and Superintendent Youngers of the Nebraska fruit exhibit.  They were asked if it would not be advisable to abandon the Peach day features and let everything in this connection go by default.  They replied in the negative and the work of having a Nebraska Peach day was started.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Youngers wrote personal letters to most of the peach growers in the state, telling them of the conditions existing and asking them what they could do.  All of them responded that they were ready and willing to help sustain Nebraska's reputation as a peach raising state.  Thus assured, Superintendent Youngers laid his plans and when the gates of the exposition grounds opened yesterday morning, he had more than 1,500 baskets of peaches to give away.  During the previous night he and his assistants had removed the fruit from the tables in the Nebraska space, had moved them close together, leaving an aisle to pass between and upon these he had piled baskets and boxes of peaches ceiling high.  As the crowd commenced to file through the building, these baskets were opened and the contents given out to the men, women and children.  All day long the line continued to be unbroken and everybody was served.</p>
                            <p>It is estimated that not less than 12,000 persons passed through the building during the day and sampled the peaches raised in Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>While there was a crowd at the distribution of peaches, there was one almost as large at the Pottawattamie County Wigwam, where Grape day was being observed.  Here the tables were covered with the fruit, which was given away by Superintendent Graham and his assistants.  Tons and tons of grapes had been sent in by the growers on the Iowa side of the river, many of whom were present to give points upon fruit growing in this section and also to convince the public that it is not necessary to go away from the river states to produce the best that the country affords.</p>

                            <p>The people who visited the Agricultural building yesterday were surprised to see so many of the exhibits containing fresh vegetables.  A few days ago Kansas commenced to show vegetables grown this year and now it appears to be the correct thing to put in a collection of the big pumpkins, squashes, beets and such things.</p>
                            <p>Oklahoma has added largely to its exhibit within the last few days and is now showing some vegetables that are mammoth in proportion.  Kansas has done the same thing and Missouri has fallen into line, showing some fine specimens of the field and the garden.</p>
                            <p>Douglas county has replenished its stock of vegetables during the last two days and continues to exhibit a collection that is hard to beat.  The farmers of the country are beginning to realize the benefit to be derived from a fine exhibit and many of them are gathering the best products and forwarding them to be put up alongside those things sent by their neighbors.</p>

                            <p>The hospital on the exposition grounds did a rushing business yesterday and the ambulance was kept on the go from morning until night.  Up to 7 o'clock last night there had been forty-two calls.  None of the persons taken in were in a serious condition <unclear reason="torn"/> partially overcome by the heat.  There was a man from the Wild West who had a broken leg, but it was a fracture of a former setting.  He was sent to one of the down town hospitals.  The same course was pursued with reference to a man from the Midway, who was afflicted with heart failure.  He had been in the emergency hospital half a dozen times.</p>

                            <p>The roads east of Chicago have notified Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation that they will only make a rate of one and one-third fares on the certificate plan for Sons of Veterans' week.  The fare from Chicago is one fare plus $2 for the round trip.  The eastern roads proposed some time ago to make a rate of one fare plus $4 if the Omaha city authorities would enact legislation that would protect the tickets from the operations of scalpers.  In their more recent communication they state that they are satisfied that the protection they require cannot be provided and that they have consequently to make the one and one-third fare rate.  This is exploited by the roads as a concession, but in exposition circles it is taken as an indication that the eastern roads are not likely to make reasonable rates at present.</p>

                            <p>In spite of the notices that have been put up at all the exit gates to warn people that when they pass through they are out of the grounds, out of town visitors persist in going outside and then kicking because they cannot get back.  Yesterday a woman with three children came in at the Sherman avenue gate and deciding to visit the Bluff tract first they went through one of the exits, expecting to reach the state buildings by that route.  They had paid four admissions and found themselves in the street after a mere glimpse of the main court.  About half a dozen similar cases occur every day and the officials are puzzled to discover a way to prevent it.  The only effective preventative seems to be to station a guard at every exit to call attention to the sign and this would be a pretty expensive system.</p>

The address of welcome will be made by Mayor Moores.  Colonel Alexander Hogeland, president of the National Home and Employment association, will be one of the speakers.  It is expected that other distinguished speakers from abroad will be present and that home talent will contribute to the interest of the occasion.  Steps were taken yesterday to secure first class vocals and instrumental music.  Governors of transmississippi states have been invited.  Mayors of cities are requested to come or send delegates.  All charitable and benevolent associations are requested to send at least one delegate to take part in the discussions of the curfew law.</p>

During the evening they got out and put up some dances that were highly enjoyed by the spectators.</p>
                            <p>There were no new arrivals at the Indian camp yesterday, but a number are expected today.

Her first work at the exposition was placed in the cooling rooms on the south side of the building yesterday and elicited much favorable comment.  She does not do statuary, but instead devotes her time to building up flowers and fancy designs out of butter.  Yesterday she modeled some bunches of roses, a cluster of fruit and some flowers.  Her work attracts a crowd and is regarded as fine as has ever been seen at any exposition.</p>

It is a photograph, 4x6 feet, and represents a cotton blockade in the switch yards of one of the roads entering Houston.  The picture was taken in the fall of 1895 when cotton came in so fast that it was found impossible to keep it moving out in sufficient quantities to clear the yards.  The picture shows ten trains on the tracks, all loaded with cotton and thousands of bales lying about, corded up like wood.</p>

Over 7,000 invitations have been sent out to attend the various trade conventions that are scheduled for that week and it is believed that a large proportion of them will be accepted.</p>
                            <p>This evening the magnificent battlepiece that was received with such marked approbation Wednesday night will be repeated on the Plaza with the usual pyrotechnical finale.  This is the most interesting fantasie that Superintendent Kelly has yet devised and it assures a big evening crowd.</p>
                            <p>The naval exhibit in the Government building is jammed full of people every forenoon to see the exhibition of the working dry dock model.  The battleship Illinois is docked and undocked at 11:30 every day and the spectacle of the ship actually moving through the water seems to possess a remarkable fascination for the average visitor.</p>
                            <p>Next Wednesday there will be a big crowd from Shenandoah, Ia.

                            <head type="sub">National Editorial Association en Route to Annual Meeting at Denver.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Will Spend Three Days Seeing the Exposition---Booming Porto Rico for the 1899 Annual.</head>
                            <p>Four hundred editors are <choice><sic>i ntown</sic><corr>in town</corr></choice>, and they are here from every state in the union, and are out for a good time, and if they do not have it they will have no one to blame for it except themselves.  The eastern party, six coach loads, arrived at Chicago Thursday morning at 7 o'clock, and spent three hours in that city, during which time the northwestern, Ohio, <unclear reason="torn"/>tors came.  In the afternoon two additional coaches were added to the train and the party started westward.  Another coach load of Illinois editors was added at Galesburg, and at Burlington Thursday the Missouri, Arkansas and southern editorial coach was attached, making eleven full coaches of editors.  There are at least 400 editors in the party, and in almost every instance one or more ladies accompany the editor, the lady being wife, sister or somebody else's sister.  The delegation was a happy one, and, as one member stated, they are having bushels of fun.  It was sing and play and fun all last night, and, as he said, "If anybody got any sleep he or she was a good one."</p>
                            <p>The train pulled into the depot at Omaha at 8:30 yesterday, nearly one hour behind time.  Colonel F. W. Richardson of the exposition press department, was on hand at the depot, and presented to Secretary Page of the association the tickets of admission to the grounds for each editor and lady present, and was ready with blank tickets to fill out the names of those whose names had not been forwarded to him by Secretary Page.  Secretary Page had made up his list three days ago of those who were coming and closed the report by saying, "and many others who have neglected to send their names."  Secretary Richardson was prepared for this and all were quickly supplied.</p>
                            <p>The special train was switched to the exposition track, and after a ten minutes' wait at the depot run to the exposition grounds.  Secretary Page had appointed a captain over each coach, and this captain had the names and all necessary information relative to this delegation.  These captains had full charge of the coach, and made all reports to Secretary Page.  At the depot the bundles of tickets and badges were presented to each captain, and he gave them to his party.  Each editor and lady was presented with a badge admitting him or her to the Midway attractions, and with smiling faces and snow white badges the party entered the exposition ready for a good time.  The work was most systematically arranged and demonstrated Secretary Page's wisdom in handling in an advantageous manner a big crowd.  There was no confusion, and probably no mistakes, and surely no delay or hitch any place in handling the large and merry party.</p>
                            <p>These are delegates to the National Editor al association annual meeting, which convenes in Denver next Tuesday for a three days' session.  President Louis Holtman of Brazil, Ind., is along and ready for an interesting meeting.  The Denver people have arranged for many excursions about Denver and in Colorado, and most of the editors will spend a week or ten days in Colorado.</p>
                            <p>They will remain in Omaha until Sunday night, their effects will be left in their cars, and those who wish will occupy their cars while in Omaha.  Some, however, preferring to get some rest, will come to the city and take rooms at some of the hotels, many having already engaged quarters in advance.  Omaha will give them a warm welcome, and do everything possible to make their stay a pleasant one.</p>
                            <p>A large number of editors from the northwest came in yesterday to join the party for a Denver trip; Secretary Page thought it probable that they would leave Omaha on two special trains instead of one, as they came in on, and that not less than 200 or 300 editors would join the party here.  They are expecting a great outing.  There are many notable and distinguished editors in the party.</p>
                            <p><del>There is a strong movement on foot to have the next meeting of the association held at Porto Rico, and the matter will be vigorously urged at the Denver meeting.  The next meeting will be held in February, 1899, and the watchword is "On to Porto Rico in 1899," and many badges were displayed with those words on them.  The eastern delegates are especially enthusiastic for Porto Rico.</del></p>
                            <p><del>Two men are being boomed for president of the association at Denver.  One of these is a Massachusetts man, Joseph B. McCabe, and about half of the editors are wearing McCabe buttons.  The southern editors have a man from New Orleans whom they are booming, and the presidential problem is narrowed down to these two&#8212;Massachusetts and Louisiana&#8212;and workers are losing no time.</del></p>

                            <p>A telegram was received at the United States custom office yesterday from the secretary of the treasury, O K-ing the forty Chinamen who came here a couple of weeks since as an attraction at the exposition.</p>
                        </div2>
                        <div2 type="article">
                            <head type="sub">MORE CHINAMEN COMING.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Chinese Concessionaire Says He Is Entitled to Bring More People.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The forty-one Chinamen who arrived in the city early this week are a part of the original allotment of the Chinese commissioner, Wong Chin Foo, who was authorized by the treasury department to bring 250 Mongolians into the United States to carry out his plans for making an extensive exhibit of Chinese goods and manufactured articles.  When Foo failed to carry out his agreement with the exposition management the concession was transferred to the Sing Nan company, which erected the building on the Bluff tract and installed the Chinese exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Under the permission to bring 250 Chinamen the company brought 238, including the recent arrivals.  The representative of the company in charge of the exhibit, Wong Aloy, claims that the company is entitled to bring in twelve more people.  Wong Aloy is a very intelligent Chinaman and speaks English fluently.  He has been in the United States several years and is entirely familiar with the laws and customs of the country.  In discussing the right of his company to bring in more people than have already been received, he produced a copy of a telegram received by President Wattles from Assistant Secretary Howell of the treasury department on May 30, stating that his company was at that time entitled to bring in 188 Chinamen.  Of this number 176 have been landed in Omaha and the remaining twelve are now on the ocean en route to the shores of the United States.  These twelve people will arrive at San Francisco within the next ten days.</p>
                            <p>When the forty-one Chinamen heretofore referred to arrived in Omaha the collector of the port refused to receive them on the ground that the full number allowed to enter the country on account of the exposition had already been received.  A lengthy telegraphic correspondence with Washington has been going on for several days and this culminated yesterday in an order from the assistant secretary of the treasury to the collector directing him to admit the Chinamen.  The telegram also contained the information that the collector at San Francisco had been instructed to not admit any more Chinamen on account of the Omaha exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese Village company on the Midway was given authority during the early stages of the exposition to bring 400 Chinamen, making a total of 650 Mongolians who were authorized to be brought into the country on account of the exposition.  In some way the local customs office was given the impression that the total number to be admitted was 400 and the records of the office show that there have now been admitted, including the recent arrivals, 441 people.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ANOTHER NEBRASKA DAY.</head>
                            <p>October 19 has been fixed as Nebraska day, and arrangements for the proper celebration of the event will be provided for at the next meeting of the Nebraska exposition commission.  A committee consisting of Chairman Neville and Commissioner Bodyston was appointed at the last meeting of the board to confer with the exposition management and fix a date for the second state day, and this matter was arranged yesterday by Commissioner Boydston and President Wattles.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boydston says that the people of Nebraska will undoubtedly attend the exposition in great numbers on the day fixed, as the farmers will have completed their harvesting operations by that time, and will have their affairs at home in such shape that they can easily take a brief holiday and come to the exposition with their whole family.</p>

                            <p>The spectacular concert which attracted so much favorable comment Tuesday night will be repeated tonight by the McCook band and the Exposition chorus.  The selection is entitled "An American Battle Scene," and is a very ambitious composition, representing the conditions in connection with the civil war.  The peace which prevailed before the great conflict is told in musical story, and then follows the transition to bloody war, with the popular war songs of both armies and a representation of a battle, ending with the songs of peace and the "Star Spangled Banner."  The first rendition of the piece on Tuesday night was a surprise to those who had witnessed the performance of selections with similar names, and the latest production was pronounced superior to all predecessors.</p>

                            <p>The Kansas exhibit of honey in the Dairy building has been duly installed and is attracting the attention of all visitors to the building.  The exhibit is composed almost entirely of alfalfa honey, which is rapidly growing in favor as its virtues are becoming better known, and bids fair to outstrip the old reliable white clover honey in popularity.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Harry J. Daveler of Elgin, Ill., lost a pocketbook containing some loose change and three diamonds on the exposition grounds yesterday afternoon and immediately notified the exposition guards of her loss.  The pocketbook was subsequently found near the Montgomery Ward building by F. R. Heft, an employe in the building, who returned it to Mrs. Daveler intact.</p>
                            <p>The monthly report of the concessions department for August shows that at the close of business on August 31 the charges against concessionaires on account of space charge, percentages, etc., amounted to $192,490.39, of which amount $187,854.21 had been paid, leaving a balance unpaid amounting to $4,636.18.  Superintendent Wadley stated that the amount charged against the concessionaires exceeded the entire amount collected from these people at the Nashville exposition by $67,000, and exceeded that at Atlanta by $72,000.</p>
                            <p>Mr. W. S. Livengood of the Los Angeles Times and family stopped over Thursday to see the exposition.  Mr. Livengood, who formerly edited a paper at Thayer, this state, is justly pleased with the attention paid the Los Angeles county exhibit, which, as he says, has to stand for all California.</p>

                            <p>To give a formal character to the occasion, a short period of speechmaking was indulged in and short talks were made by Major Hambleton, President Holtman of the Editorial association, President Wattles, A.

                            <p>This was the cry that greeted the ears of the street railway passengers to the exposition grounds yesterday as the cars stopped at the Bluff tract entrance, and a larger number than usual alighted at that point.</p>
                            <p>It was peach day, and those in charge of the Nebraska fruit display owned it all, for they did everything that was done to make it peach day.  There has been lack of harmony among the exhibitors about this occasion.  When the project was first suggested it was the desire of the Colorado, Missouri and Utah people that the date be early in September.  The Nebraska men did not want this because the peach crop here is not at its best until the middle of September.  But the date was fixed for today, and the Nebraska fruit exhibitors determined to make the best of it.  They were left to do it all because the people from the other states were not prepared to furnish peaches of the kind they had expected.</p>
                            <p>The peach crop is short everywhere, but the Nebraska growers sent in as large a quantity as possible and it was distributed over the Nebraska tables.  Apples were added, so that all comers were served.  The distribution was under the direction of Peter Youngers, George Marshal, Charles Nownes and Frank Clark, assisted by the force at the Nebraska state building.</p>

                            <p>Shortly before noon yesterday the Minneapolis Journal's Excursion party came in on the Rock Island road.  The party occupied two sleepers, and left Minneapolis at 7:30 Thursday night.  It was made up largely of Minneapolis people and was a happy set, 100 strong.  From the depot the party was taken directly to the Dellone hotel, where lunch was served promptly at noon, and at 1 o'clock the party was taken to the exposition on the Sherman avenue cars, three trains being in waiting at Fourteenth and Capitol avenue.</p>
                            <p>The party is under the charge of A. W.

The program arranged is as follows:  The exposition yesterday and tomorrow, all expenses paid by the Journal, the rate from Minneapolis is $13.50 for the round trip, hotel bill, exposition tickets for the two days being provided, and all to be covered by the amount named.  The tickets are good for all who wish to remain over until Monday, but the paper's contract for expenses closes with the arrival of the special at Minneapolis Sunday morning.</p>
                            <p>A. C. Cutts, general passenger agent of the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis road, accompanied the party.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The masque carnival at the exposition last night was one of the most notable and successful events from a social and artistic standpoint of the many interesting and successful demonstrations which have taken place on the grounds since the opening of the exposition.  They surrounding conditions were perfect and the whole affair passed off without a hitch in any particular.</p>
                            <p>The night was an ideal one, albeit the temperature was a little higher than was absolutely essential, and the gentle breeze from the south added to the comfort of the thousands of people who assembled to witness the ceremonies.  Lowering clouds in the west about 8 o'clock threatened to bring the rain for which all good citizens have been praying there many days, but the alarm proved to be false so far as the carnival was concerned, for no moisture appeared to dampen the ardor and costumes of the frolickers.</p>
                            <p>The threatening aspect of the heavens did not lessen the great tide of people which set in toward the exposition grounds long before the hour <choice><sic>anonunced</sic><corr>announced</corr></choice> for the festivities to commence.  The street cars on all lines were filled to overflowing as soon as evening set in and fully an hour before the time announced for the parade to start the wide walks about the lagoon were filled with people.  They crowded into the open space in front of the Government building which had been roped off for the festivities and all the efforts of a large force of guards were scarcely sufficient to clear this space.  The steps of the Government building were reserved for the officers of the board of control of the building and their families and friends and this point of vantage was quickly filled with these people.</p>

                            <p>The surpassing beauty of the scene which lay before them was enough to enthrall the attention of the assembled crowds while waiting for the maskers to appear.  Never had King Carnival such a setting for the festivities of his court.  The beautifully classic buildings all about formed a setting for the scene which excelled in magnificence the fondest dream of the esthetic and recalled the fabulous stories of the Arabian Nights.  Thousands of incandescent bulbs sparkled like diamonds and the myriad reflections in the glittering surface of the rippling lagoon multiplied the glittering gems until there seemed to be millions of them.  The soft plash of the fountain breached a fairy symphony which held the rapt attention of the admiring thousands while the hundreds of brightly colored Chinese lanterns added a touch of gay color to the scene which harmonized beautifully with the general tone of the picture.</p>
                            <p>These lanterns were suspended at short intervals between the clusters of incandescent bulbs which line the lagoon and to still further add to the gaiety of the scene flags of bright colors were placed on temporary staves along the lagoon railing and stretched in long strings above the colonades at either end of the main court.  Altogether, the setting for the gay scene of the carnival was artistic to a degree.</p>

                            <p>The maskers commenced assembling shortly before 8 o'clock and the vicinity of the Auditorium was soon crowded to overflowing.  The formation of the line was in charge of Major Clarkson and Dudley Smith, W. H. Thomas and W. G. Shriver as aides.  The participants were marshaled with little trouble and the procession started about 8:30 with the McCook band in the lead, and about 500 people in the line.  The line of march was via the north side of the lagoon to Twentieth street and thence to the south side and west to the Government building.</p>
                            <p>All along the line of march the maskers were greeted with applause and shouts of approval as some well known character appeared.  When the Government building was reached the applause was doubled and amounted to an ovation.  The band b<unclear reason="torn"/>ed at one

Confetti was produced from mysterious recesses, and everybody seemed to have it.  Soon the air was filled with the flying bits of colored paper and the mimic battle was fought with all the vigor of a genuine conflict.</p>
                            <p>The variety of characters represented by the participants in the carnival covered a wide range.  There were representatives of all nations, with the oriental predominating.  Some were dignified in their gorgeous splendor, but the great majority were of the frivolous sort, befitting the occasion.</p>

                            <p>After the battle of confetti the line was again formed and the procession marched east along the north side of the lagoon to the east end of the court, where the line was dismissed.</p>
                            <p>The participants in the carnival had all kinds of fun with one another and with their friends and acquaintances in the crowd of spectators.  Nearly all of them removed their masks on account of the heat, but the disguise was so perfect in many cases that the uncovering of the face furnished little clue to the identity of the individual.</p>

A great proportion of the increased attendance of the last week consisted <unclear reason="torn"/> for the first time able to spare the time to come and attractions that were only given a superficial glance by preceding visitors are becoming popular features as the farmers and their families congregate on the grounds.  The north tract with its exhibits of implements, dairy products and honey fairly divides the crowd with the more magnificent attractions of the main court.  The city visitors who came earlier in the season were contented to merely rush through these building and then return to things that more nearly harmonized with their tastes, but now they are full of people every hour of the day.  The farmers more thoroughly appreciate the immense display of vehicles and farming implements and machinery and many of them are contented to spend an entire day in the Transportation building, studying the new types of labor-saving farm machinery and learning something every minute that will some time be of advantage to them in their vocation.  Here he can inspect a hundred devices that have been invented during the last few years, each of which represents a distinct advance in agricultural facilities.  He finds attendants ready to explain all the intricacies and advantages of the modern improvements, and if there was nothing else on the grounds he would consider himself well repaid for his trip.</p>
                            <p>The increased tendency of the crowds to patronize this part of the grounds has also resulted in a decided increase in the visitors to the Indian encampment.  All day hundreds of people loiter through the enclosure watching the domestic life of the aboriginals with all the interest that attaches to an entirely novel spectacle and in the evenings when the red men congregate to indulge in their fantastic dances, the entire surrounding space is filled with people.  As the encampment is continually being extended by the addition of new tribes that bring their own peculiar forms of life and amusement, the entertainment never becomes tiresome and new features are constantly being introduced.</p>

                            <p>A happy result of the handsome patronage that the exposition has enjoyed during the last two weeks is the reduction of the floating debt by $122,623.17.  The balance now standing against the association exclusive of the expenditure that has been ordered for the Firemen's tournament and the Live Stock show is $57,834.40 as compared to $180,457.57 a month ago.  At the beginning of August the floating indebtedness of the association was distributed as follows:  Warrants outstanding, $32,360.44; bills payable, $45,112.91; balances on contracts, $71,499.37; overdraft on treasurer, $31,484.85; total $180,457.57.  Since that time the warrants outstanding have been cut down over $20,000.  More than 50 per cent of the contract balances and bills have been taken up and the overdraft on the treasurer has been wiped out.  The record now stands:  Warrants, $12,242.28; bills payable, $20,680.03; contract balances, $32,777.62; current bills, (estimated), $7,500. total, $73,199.93; less $15,365.53, cash on hand, $57,834.40.</p>
                            <p>A large proportion of the visitors who have been in the city during the week went home before Sunday, and the result was a rather slim attendance yesterday.  There was nothing in particular to induce people to remain who had already seen the permanent features of the show.  The exercises and reception that were to have been held in the Auditorium yesterday morning in recognition of Editor's day were called off at the last minute as the purpose had been practically served by the reception which occurred at the Illinois building the preceding evening.  As this was not decided on until yesterday, a large audience, including most of the visiting editors, assembled in the Auditorium and waited until it became apparent that no program was to be rendered.  They were entertained by an excellent concert by the Mexican band, which they seemed to consider ample compensation for the absence of more elaborate exercises.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Second Nebraska Will Be the Exposition's Guests on Wednesday.</head>
                            <p>General Manager Clarkson called on Colonel C. J. Bills of the Second Nebraska volunteer infantry at Fort Omaha yesterday afternoon to discuss the arrangements that had been made by the exposition management for the reception and entertainment of the soldiers on the grounds next Wednesday.  After the general plan had been outlined Colonel Bills stated that it met with his hearty approval and expressed his appreciation of the courtesy extended.</p>
                            <p>The regiment will arrive on the grounds soon after 10 o'clock and remain until the same hour in the evening.  This will permit them to take in the whole show, including the fireworks and the Midway, and to spend the entire day in mingling with their old friends and acquaintances without the restrictions of camp life.  Their visit will not be signalized by any elaborate exercises.  It was believed that the boys <unclear reason="torn"/> exposition more fully if they were left to their own devices and the society of their relatives and friends.  Consequently the speechmaking of the occasion will be confined to a short but hearty welcome and the only additional ceremony will be a big dinner at Markel's cafe, which will fill any gaps that may remain after the hospitality that they enjoyed at the hands of the Omaha women yesterday.</p>
                            <p>The regiment will march from the north entrance through the Midways to the Horticulture building and thence back past the band stand, where they will be reviewed by Governor Holcomb, the exposition officials, Mayor Moores and various other dignitaries.  Then they will be massed on the Grand Plaza, where Governor Holcomb will very briefly bid them welcome home.  President Wattles will probably add a greeting in behalf of the exposition.  Colonel Bills will respond and then the soldiers will break ranks and make a combined assault on the big dinner that will be ready in the cafe.</p>
                            <p>After dinner the visitors will be turned over to their friends and this will be one of the most important features of the day.  Hundreds of parents and friends and sweethearts are expected to come in from all over the state to spend the day with their soldier boys and as in most cases this will be their first meeting since the Second regiment marched away to answer President McKinley's call the occasion will be a happy reunion of family ties that will touch the heart of every onlooker.  An especially brilliant display of fireworks is being prepared for the evening, which will include a number of special designs that will be particularly appropriate.</p>

                            <p>The total attendance during the last week was 135,792, an increase of about 20,000 over the preceding week.  The average attendance per day was 19,399, as compared with 16,549 during the week before and 14,813 during the week ending August 20.  Every day registered a material improvement over the corresponding day of the previous week, except Wednesday and Saturday.  On Wednesday it was very nearly the same in each week, but as yesterday was featureless, as compared with the big Bohemian day celebration a week ago, the balance is decidedly in favor of Bohemian day.  The attendance each day during the last three weeks is a graphic illustration of the manner in which the crowds are booming.</p>

                            <p>Rev. Raphael Awaring, recently from Moscow, Russia, arrived in the city last night and will spend several days at the exposition, the guest of his old friend, Gaston Akoun of the Streets of All Nations.  For years Rev. Awaring has been a bishop of the Orthodox Greek church of Russia.  He met Mr. Akoun when the latter was in Moscow in 1891.  Since that time the two have been warm friends.  The noted divine has recently established a church in New York City and will make America his home.  When he reached the exposition grounds yesterday afternoon he was met at the gates by Mr. Akoun and the people of the streets and conducted to the concession, where an elaborate dinner was served.  Later in the day he was escorted about the grounds and appeared to be well pleased with the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the exposition Rev. Awaring said:  "It is a magnificent exhibition of the wealth, science and ability of the Americans.  It shows that when they undertake a thing they can carry it through, no matter what obstacles are thrown in their way.  War and hard times do not seem to have interfered with this great exposition.  Notwithstanding these obstructions it has gone ahead and is as near perfection as it is possible for man to build."</p>

                            <p>There have been any number of dances given out at the Indian village on the exposition grounds, but the one that was put up last night was the prize winner.  It was a war dance and was called at 6:30 o'clock and continued for nearly four hours.  It was participated in by representatives from all of the tribes with the exception of the Arizona Apaches, who refused to take a part for the reason that they regard the war dance a sacred function which should not be observed in the presence of any except their own people.</p>
                            <p>To start the dance at the Indian village last night, a ring of some 150 feet in diameter was roped off to keep the whites back.  Into this fully 200 <unclear reason="torn"/>

                            bedecked with bright-colored paints and feathers entered and squatted upon the haunches around the musicians, who were provided with drums.  Then followed the old men and the women of the tribes.  They, however, did not enter the charmed circle but contented themselves by sitting just outside the ropes.  Like the braves who had shed their blood on the battlefields, they were robed and painted in gay and striking colors.  Still they wore more clothing and seemed to better enjoy the cool breeze that drifted in from the north.</p>
                            <p>At a signal that nobody but an Indian could understand, Crow Dog, a Ponca, jumped into the center of the ring and letting out a whoop that tore a three-cornered hole in the night and at the same time caused the white women to cling more closely to their escorts and drive some of the small children almost into hysterics, recounted some of the acts of bravery that he had performed.  With gestures much like those of a ward politician, Mr. Dog told of a time some twenty-five years ago when he went on a hunting tour into the northwest and with a number of companions surprised and scalped fifteen Blackfeet.  He said that they brought the scalps home, and as evidence of the fact, pulled out a small piece of skin with long hair attached.</p>
                            <p>Right at this point there was a break in the oratory of Mr. Dog.  A brave from the Blackfeet tribe intimated that the alleged scalp was nothing but a chunk of skin cut from the back of a black dog.  Mr. Crow Dog was about to argue the point, when he was informed that he had better keep still, as the Blackfoot was only playing a part.</p>

                            <head type="sub">White Wolf's Story Stands.</head>
                            <p>Whether Mr. Dog was telling the truth or simply running in a bluff was not decided, for before there was an opportunity of settling the matter the master of ceremonies called time and the dance was on.  One hundred half naked Indians, wearing huge war bonnets of eagle feathers stuck into red flannel, bounded to their feet and commenced to dance, keeping time to the sound of the drum.  This dance and music continued for some fifteen minutes, the Indians jumping around like a lot of frozen footed chickens.  Then they retired to the ropes and some Indian who was too old to dance passed the hat and gathered up the pennies.  After a long wait, White Wolf, an Assiniboine, clothed in a girdle and a bunch of eagle feathers, entered the arena and in a voice that sounded like the filing of a saw told of an occasion when he at the head of a company of braves swooped down upon an Indian camp and run off with a lot of ponies that belonged to the Omahas.  He said that he and the members of his party were followed for twenty miles and that while ten brave young men did the following none of them returned.  A number of the old Assiniboines who were sitting about the circle declared that the tale told by White Wolf was true and there was not an Omaha who entered a denial.</p>
                            <p>White Wolf having furnished evidence that once upon a time he had killed his man, was declared entitled to dance and consequently he led the set.  He danced until he was exhausted, but not so with the others who were in it with him.  They kept it up for a few minutes and would have kept right along had not Big Brown Bear, a Sioux, motioned for a cessation of the festivities.  In the best Sioux that he could muster, he said that he wanted to talk.  He was given a chance and commenced to tell how glad he felt to think that he had been enabled to meet with so many of the braves from the different tribes.</p>
                            <p>"How about having tasted blood?" asked an old man who was sitting by one of the posts that held the rope in place.</p>
                            <p>"Had forgotten that, but was just coming to the point when I was interrupted," responded Mr. Big Brown Bear.  "I have killed all kinds of people in my time and I have the evidence with me and will show you."  Suiting the action to the word, Mr. Bear pulled from a girdle, his only article of clothing, aside from a war bonnet, a notched stick and after flourishing it over his head a few times, brought it down on a level with his eyes and counted off twenty-six notches.  Then looking at the old man, while a withering smile played over his lips, he asked, in a sneering way, "Is that enough?"  The old man suddenly discovered that he had important business at his tepee and slunk away, while the Indians, both young and old, males and females, hooted as him as he disappeared in the darkness.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mr. Bear Made a Hit.</head>
                            <p>Big Brown Bear, having established the fact that he was a brave man, motioned for the head drummer to beat his tomtom and, leading the dance, he whisked about the circle like a mustang pony, while the other Indians followed.  The little incident caused Bear to be the center of attraction.  It is said by those who know something about Indian customs that had the man who offered the insult to Mr. Bear been <unclear reason="torn"/> been blood upon the face of the pale September moon, but as he is on the shady side of 90 it will pass unheeded.</p>
                            <p>Brave Bear had been itching to tell of some of the brave things that he had done and when he got a chance he said that he had the record to show how he had won the right to dance.  Being an influential Indian, his proof was not required and he was invited to set the hot foot for the younger men of the different tribes.  The dance that he figured in was one of the emotional of the evening.</p>
                            <p>Numerous other Indians detailed the hair raising acts that they performed in their younger days and the old men and women vouched for them, so that none who attempted to be first to set the pace for the dance were deprived of the pleasure.</p>
                            <p>There is a peculiarity about the Indian war dance.  It is a religious, but not a sacred ceremony.  Any man who has taken a human life in battle may participate, but others are barred from the charmed circle.  In olden times it was an incentive for young men to go out and make records for themselves.  It is also said that half a century ago no Indian maiden would look with favor upon a man who was not entitled to take part in the dance.  That is the story told by some of the old men of the different tribes, but with the young and intelligent Indians it is taken with a grain of allowance.  At the dance last night a number of young boys participated, but it is said that they were let in just for fun and that they might play a part.</p>

                            <p>The popularity of the Caman Military band from Winfield, Kan., was pretty fully established yesterday afternoon when Prof. Caman took his boys over to the Press building to serenade the working newspaper men and the occupants of the building.  The band was lined up in front of the structure and played a selection, but that was not enough.  The musicians were invited in and played another piece, during the rendition of which the members of the National Press association dropped in to enjoy the music.  After playing for half an hour, there was an intermission, during which several speeches were delivered by the editors, after which there was more music, the band rendering "America."</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Greef of Kansas was called upon and after discussing the exposition, designating it as the biggest thing of its kind ever seen in the United States, he said the band is the biggest and best thing outside of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Three cheers were given for the Caman band and three more for Kansas, after which "Dixie" and "Yankee Doodle" were played.  This music was followed by three more cheers for the Sunflower state and the Sunflower band.  It is conceded by all that this is one of the best bands that has visited the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The fantasie, "American Battle Scene," was rendered on the Plaza last night by the McCook band and the Exposition chorus and it made the hit of the season.  Fireworks and music added to the occasion, but the climax was reached when a detachment from company C, Second Nebraska, marched in and was escorted to seats on the stage.  The boys had come down from the camp at Fort Omaha.  They were not in their dress uniforms, but that made no difference.  They were cheered as they ascended the stage and they were cheered and cheered when the band struck up and played "America."  The people were not ready to quit, but instead demanded more of the same but instead demanded more of the same kind of music and would not be satisfied until "Yankee Doodle: and "Dixie" had been played as encores.</p>
                            <p>It was apparent that the soldier boys were the lions of the evening and after the concert they were surrounded by the crowd and given a reception that must have gladdened their hearts.  Their hands were grasped by men, women and children and as they marched off the grounds they cheered again.  Nothing was too good for them and on the Midway all of the doors swung open to them.</p>

                            <p>Last Tuesday about fifty orphan children from St. James' orphanage, Benson, enjoyed an exceedingly agreeable visit to the great Transmississippi Exposition.  The little ones were treated right royally by the various managers and agents, both of the Omaha &amp; Benson Street Railroad company and of the exposition.  Everywhere on the grounds they were welcomed with the greatest kindness and courtesy.  The concessionaires of the various attractions on the Midway vied with one another in extending the freedom of the whole show to the children and their escorts.  They shot the chutes and visited the lions and tigers; some of the youngsters, though, nearly had fits when the huge elephant extended his trunk to <choice><sic>welome</sic><corr>welcome</corr></choice> them.  In fact they saw everything worth seeing and left as the <unclear reason="torn"/>nations of the fairy dream court of honor, a well contented crowd of children.  Who may tell what glowing dreams filled their little brains that night when each was tucked away in its own little cot and was gathered in the arms of nature's sweet restorer!  The orphans thank sincerely their many kind friends for that ever memorable treat and ask God to bless them for their generosity.</p>

                            <p>Further arrangements for the celebration of Jubilee week are hanging on the result of the interview of the special committee with President McKinley and the announcement of the exact date on which the president will visit the exposition.  The general plan of the celebration has been very largely worked out, but it will not be positively settled until the management knows which day will be McKinley day and then the other celebrations will be arranged to harmonize with the big event.</p>
                            <p>One very pretty feature for Jubilee week is being worked up by the Women's Board of Managers.  This is a living flag of school <choice><sic>chidren</sic><corr>children</corr></choice>, which will be formed by grouping several hundred children in the form of a flag, the color design being worked out by the costumes of the children.  It has not been decided just how many children will be utilized in the design, as this will depend very largely on the occasion on which the spectacle will be used and the space that can be devoted to it.  The matter has been placed in the hands of a special committee, of which Miss Fannie Arnold is chairman, to be worked out with the co-operation of the exposition officials.</p>

                            <p>In the minds of a great many people the burning question is what shall the exposition do for a very high class musical entertainment in the closing weeks when the weather is cool and pyrotechnic sonatas have ceased to please.</p>
                            <p>It is a question.  Some of those who are loudest in their clamor for something "good" did the least to support the good things when they were here in June.  Witness the Thomas orchestra concerts, the Congress of Musicians, the recitals which went begging for an audience.  Many an afternoon when the doors of the exposition auditorium were thrown open to the public, without extra charge, the orchestra was obliged to play largely for its own delectation.  The Apollo club, which appeared here under Mr. Tomlins of Chicago, an organization of which Chicago may be justly proud, did not get the attention which it deserved.  And then, to think that the club was accompanied by the best men, the very cream of the Thomas orchestra, and had as soloists Jenny Osborne, Katharine Fisk, George Hamlin and Frank King Clark.  This quartet would have been sufficient to satisfy, even if there had been no chorus, no orchestra or no conductor, whose reputation was far reaching.  The afternoon concerts were poorly attended.  There was not a concert given that did not develop into a promenade concert.  Shall then, the exposition insist on forcing upon the people something which they will not have or will the people show that they want art?  Had the people something which they will not have or will the people show that they want art?  Had the people come out and clamored for high class music when it was here there would be no thought of having anything else than a repetition of the programs of June.</p>
                            <p>But, alas, Beethoven was not as potent as the band stand, nor Mozart as the Midway.</p>
                            <p>And many students left the Auditorium long before a Wagner program was over, fired with an ambition to discover perchance a sympathetic touch in the symphony orchestra of the Chinese village which <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">National Association Will Hold a Competition in Omaha During the Present Week.</head>
                            <p>Members of the National Firemen's association in the city are making large plans for the firemen's tournament which will be held north of the exposition grounds from September 5 to 10.  From assurance received by the local committee the convention will be one of the largest to be held this summer and several thousand firemen with equipment are expected to attend.  Over 100 companies, averaging about thirty each, have entered their names for the different events and they will be accompanied by a large number of friends and backers.  A very favorable rate of 1 cent a mile has been obtained and teams will attend from as far east as Pennsylvania and from almost every town of importance in the transmississippi country.  Arrangements are being made for the accommodation of the visitors and about fifty companies have decided to camp on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The grounds, which include a strip about four blocks wide and one-half mile long, have been fenced and provided with suitable buildings and accessories.  A pompier tower, five stories in height, has been erected and two buildings, three stories high, have been put up to be sacrificed in showing the fire fighting ability of the firemen and their equipment.  Several engine houses are on the ground, as well as temporary structures for the protection of stock.  A track has been prepared for straightaway events, 350 yards long, and it is expected to witness some new records.</p>
                            <p>The tournament will open Monday with a grand parade, to be given in connection with the Labor day demonstration, when there will be liberal cash prizes for such features as the best appearing fire department, that attending from the longest distance and the largest representation from one city.  In the afternoon there will be races and ladder climbing contests.  Tuesday will be termed Nebraska day and only teams from this state will be entered.  The events will be races and hitching contests and the rescuing of people from burning buildings.  The remainder of the tournament will be devoted to quick hitching and tug-of-war contests, pompier life saving, drills and engine races.</p>
                            <p>Arrangements are in charge of Fred A. Wood, president, and E. W. Barkman, secretary, and they have already received notice of the engagement of twenty special trains.  The last meeting of the sort was in Chicago in 1878, when there were more than 10,000 firemen in attendance.</p>
                            <p>Today the bulk of the competing companies will arrive and get ready to enter the Monday events.  Secretary E. W. Barkman of the National Firemen's association says that practically all the firemen who will participate in the tournament will arrive some time today, and that he is assured that the representation will be extraordinary considering the disadvantages in the way of railroad rates that were encountered.  The bulk of the companies will come from Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas, although Missouri, Colorado, South Dakota and various other states will also be represented.  His correspondence indicates that aside from the numerous departments that will send from two to a dozen men the following towns will be represented by teams that will average twenty-five men each:  Malvern, Harlan, Guthrie Center, Grinnell, Corning, Cherokee, Marian, Dyersville, Shenandoah, Chariton, Red Oak, Creston, Villisca, Manning, Atlantic City and Wilton Junction, Ia.; Farmington, Polo, Canton and Mount Carroll, Ill.; Plattsmouth, Wisner, Blair, Minden, York, Grand Island and Neligh, Neb.; Galena, Winfield, Junction City, Ottawa, Marysville, Pittsburg, Beloit and Ashland, Kan.; Vermillion, Central City, Niggenville, Sturgis and Yankton, S. D.; Webb City, Joplin, Carthage and Chillicothe, Mo.; Denver, Aspen and Central City, Colo., and Jefferson and Oconomowoc, Wis.</p>

                            <p>An exhibit possessing as much dramatic interest as any in the Government building is the collection of photographs sent by soldiers of the civil war to friends at home, and which be reason of incomplete address never reached their destination.  At the end of the war the Postoffice department had on hand 5,000 photographs of this sort, which were placed on exhibit at the dead letter office in the hope that they would be identified by visitors.  In the years which followed 2,000 of them have been claimed by those for whom they were intended, and there were many pathetic and dramatic incidents in connection with their discovery.  Wives and sweethearts came across the pictures of loved ones who had disappeared without a word, and it was possible by the index on the photographs to put them in possession of the letters which had been attached.  For some time after the war these identifications were of almost daily occurrence, but in the last few years such discoveries have been growing less and less as the ante-bellum generation has faded away and the soldier boys of the civil way have outgrown their appearance at that time.</p>
                            <p>Although the collection has been exhibited at all the recent expositions, identifications of the pictures have been of rare occurrence, and the department has given up hope of locating the greater part of those remaining.  During the last three months several of the collection have been partially identified by people who imagined they saw a likeness to some person they knew, but in only one case has the assurance been sufficient to justify the official in charge in surrendering the portrait.</p>

Gorman, assistant superintendent of the Omaha Street railway company, was examining the cabinet of war photographs when she came upon one which she recognized as her father's.  It had been sent in a letter from the military camp at Indianapolis, Ind., to his family at South Bend, Ind., shortly before Mr. Gorman's regiment had been ordered to the front.  He left shortly afterward for the south, and had no opportunity to communicate with his friends for a long interval.  The letter had miscarried, and the photograph had occupied its place in the dead letter exhibit for over thirty-five years.  Colonel Brownlow, in charge of the exhibit, has received the following acknowledgement from Mr. Gorman:</p>
                            <p>W. G. Brownlow&#8212;Dear sir:  I received today from my daughter the photograph that she found at the Government building at the exposition grounds.  It is the same I sent through the mail when I was in the army.  I belonged to the Eighty-sixth Indiana volunteers, Company D, and I am greatly obliged for the return of the picture.</p>
                            <ab>J. J. GORMAN.</ab>
                            <p>The dead letter exhibit contains a vast number of other relics which have accumulated owing to the haste and carelessness of the American people.  As an example of these traits there is a collection of souvenir exposition postals which have been mailed at the branch office in connection with the exhibit, and which can never be delivered.  Over 100 have been mailed in the last three months, an average of over three daily, containing interesting communications on one side, and on the other no address whatever.  Most of these are from country people anxious to send word to their friends, but who are in too nervous a state to attend to the detail of inscribing the address.  Most of them are signed "Father," "Brother," or "Your Loving John," and hence there is no way of locating the senders.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Confiscates a Bomb.</head>
                            <p>One of the most interesting specimens in the postoffice exhibit is a bomb addressed to Senor Don Antonius Eulate, commander of the Vizcaya, intended to be delivered to him while his ship was anchored in New York harbor.  The package excited the suspicion of the department, which was on the lookout for matter of the sort, and had used its privilege of opening anything in the form of a package addressed to parties liable to suffer at the hands of fanatics.  The bomb, which had evidently been sent by some enthusiast in the cause of Cuba's freedom, was made of a strong pasteboard box, and contained enough <unclear reason="covered"/></p>
                            <p>Another interesting death machine was a revolver contained in a box with the trigger so connected that the weapon would be discharged in the direction of the person undoing the lid.  It had been designed by a rejected suitor in Baltimore, Md., whose proposals had not been favorably received by an heiress of that city.  He accordingly mailed her the infernal machine, which she opened without harm, as the suitor had proved a poor machinist, and the trigger connection had not been well adjusted.</p>
                            <p>A number of practical jokes have also found their way into the collection which the intended recipient was too acute to accept.  The method usually used is to send some ponderous piece of freight, like a brick, with the postage insufficiently paid.  The person for whom it is intended is notified by the department that a package addressed to him is held for postage, and the amount is usually forwarded to the supposed satisfaction of the joker.  The amount of postage collected on such goods sometimes amounts to several dollars.</p>
                            <p>One envelope in the collection contains a lock of Guiteau's hair, which he sent to a wealthy widow in New York, from whom he hoped to obtain assistance.  The woman had gone to Europe, however, and after following her for some time on her travels the token landed in the dead letter office.</p>
                            <p>Under another case is a valuable porcelain tray, containing a painted landscape burned into the surface with remarkable skill.  It is the work of a famous Russian, and is valued at several hundred dollars, but was sent by parties traveling abroad with an erroneous address.</p>
                            <p>A curious method of sending money through the mails were adopted by a Georgia man who wished to remit $1 to the director of the geological survey for a Manual of Topographical Methods.  He pasted paper on both sides of the coin, writing the address on one side, with the stamp, and the order on the other.  The communication reached its destination.</p>
                            <p>Every two years a grand auction sale is conducted at Washington to dispose of the accumulated merchandise.  The articles on hand are done up in packages containing general information as to the contents, and bids are received either at the sale or previously from the list catalogue.  The purchase is largely a lottery, and it is found that the articles bring 50 per cent more when sold on only a partial knowledge of their character.</p>

                            <p>The World-Herald believes that under proper provisions the exposition can be successfully reopened and held during September and October of next year.</p>
                            <p>It is even now not too early to consider this idea and the board of directors ought to appoint a committee to consider and report upon the matter at an early date.</p>
                            <p>The exposition, if held for sixty days next year, could be enlarged and improved.  It would be already well advertised and would not be forced to do business in competition with an exciting war.  The present buildings and grounds would not require much expense in improvement or repair.</p>
                            <p>There being no other exposition scheduled for 1899 we see no reason to doubt that a great success could be scored.</p>

                            <p>Labor day on the exposition grounds is in decided contrast to the bustle of pushing crowds, the blare of bands and the array of marching battalions that filled the down town streets.  In deference to these demonstrations no effort has been made to organize any celebration on the grounds and the day is entirely without feature.  But the superiority of the exposition as a drawing attraction is again demonstrated, for if thousands of visitors remained down town to see the parade, other thousands went to the show, and it enjoyed very nearly the usual Monday patronage.  A large number of excursionists who had come to participate in the Montana day celebration tomorrow are on the grounds today and numerous excursions from less distant points brought several thousand new admirers to the White City.  There was a crowd in front of each of the main entrances during most of the forenoon and after lunch the people who remained down town in the morning came out in large numbers.  Tonight the admission will be 25 cents after 6 o'clock, and it is expected that thousands of the workingmen who are participating in the Labor day demonstration will take advantage of the reduced rate to end their day's enjoyment with an evening at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>At no time since the gates were opened have the grounds been more attractive.  While the complete covering of turf and gravel made it impossible for any amount of dust to accumulate inside the enclosure, the adjacent streets had become so dry that the wind carried the fine particles over the fence and deposited them impartially over flowers, foliage and white buildings.  All this was washed away by the rain and this morning the landscapes reveled in a brilliancy of coloring that excited the undisguised admiration of every visitor.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sunday at the Fair.</head>
                            <p>There was a tide of travel northward yesterday that induced pedestrians to believe that it would be necessary to knock a few more holes in the exposition fence to admit the crowd.  Street cars were packed and even women and children hung timorously on the footboards until there was no room for more.  But the exposition was not the only attraction in sight, for a large proportion of the travelers rode past its gates to the barracks where the soldier boys were encamped waiting for the order to be mustered out.  Consequently the turnstiles that were already in place were able to handle the business very comfortably and the transmississippi show was compelled to be contented to a very fair division of honors with the martial magnet at Fort Omaha.</p>
                            <p>In spite of the great counter attraction it was far from being a dull day on the grounds.  There was about the usual Sunday crowd and the numerous attractions were fairly patronized.  The burst of rain that came during the afternoon was rather agreeable than otherwise.  A few pretty dresses were caught unawares and lost some of their attractiveness and there was a hurried scamper for shelter.  But the buildings afforded ample protection and the people watched the rain through the windows and congratulated each other that the dust that had made life a burden for the last few days was effectually disposed of.  The Mexican band was playing in front of the Government building when the rain came pouring down and scattered its audience.  But the musicians huddled on the wide portico <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>In half an hour the clouds scattered and a magnificent rainbow arched over the bluff tract and under its prismatic hues the white architecture of the buildings presented as pretty a picture as ever lay out of doors.  From the other end of the grounds it looked as though the aerial illumination was expressly moulded to benison the exposition and the superstitiously inclined pointed it out as an omen of continued prosperity for the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>The Sunday night crowd suffered somewhat on account of the indications of another storm, but under the dark blanket of cloud the electric illuminations were more than ordinarily beautiful.  Every ray of incandescent radiance was emphasized against the somber background and the numberless lines of light that outlined the buildings stood out clearly in the purified atmosphere.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Features that Will Fill the Days with Pleasure.</head>
                            <p>In some respects the current week will be more fully occupied with features of special and general interest than any that have preceded it.  While there have been one or two events of <choice><sic>grater</sic><corr>greater</corr></choice> significance no week has offered so great a variety of attractions.  Fully a dozen special events, each of which is of interest to a large proportion of exposition visitors, will mark the last five days of the week and several of them have already attracted attention all over the transmississippi country.</p>
                            <p>These features do not include the National Firemen's tournament which begins today and continues during the week.  This is regarded as entirely distinct from the exposition, but it will incidentally bring thousands of visitors to the show during its continuance.  In addition to this novel and interesting entertainment only a couple of rods from the exposition enclosure, every day after today will be marked by from one to four celebrations of more than ordinary interest.</p>
                            <p>There will be no Labor day celebration on the grounds today on account of a difference of opinion between the management and the labor leaders in regard to the extent of the concessions that should be made in return for the location of the celebration on the grounds.  The labor unions decided to hold their celebration down town and the exposition has refrained from organizing any demonstration that might be considered an effort to interfere with the labor program.</p>
                            <p>Tuesday is Montana day and Governor Smith and a large party of state officials and prominent citizens will assist to make the occasion remembered.  The exercises will be held in the Auditorium and with a special railroad rate in force from all Montana points a large attendance of Montana people is anticipated.</p>
                            <p>The reception of the Nebraska soldiers Wednesday will be one of the big events of the week and although the exercises of the day will be abbreviated in order to give the visitors ample opportunity to see the show it is believed that thousands of relatives and friends of the volunteers will congregate on the grounds to assist to make their holiday enjoyable.  A large excursion from Galesburg, Ill., is also scheduled on the same day and in the evening there will be a big fireworks display.</p>
                            <p>Thursday will be signalized by the celebration of the Nebraska Pharmaceutical association and the Fraternal Union of America and Colonel Alexander Hogeland will deliver an address at the Auditorium at 2 o'clock in recognition of which the day has also been featured as Curfew day.</p>
                            <p>Friday will be made notable by a quartet of attractions that should pack the grounds.  The Woodmen of the World will congregate to participate in a big celebration and the local committees are confident that this feature alone will secure the attendance of fully 5,000 members of the order.  It will also be Lumbermen's day and a large proportion of the lumber dealers of this and adjoining states, as well as representatives of the big lumber interests of the northwest, are expected.  The Nebraska Lumberman's association and the Hoo Hoos will meet in special sessions on the grounds and a log rolling contest on the lagoon and various other features will assist to amuse the crowd.  Not least in interest will be the distribution of thousands of luscious melons by the Rocky Ford people and to add additional interest to the day several big excursions will come from Colorado to celebrate Colorado day with the usual ceremonies.  The fireworks display at night will be a revelation and unless all indications fail the Fourth of July record will be endangered.</p>
                            <p>Saturday a big excursion will come from Norfolk, Neb., to spend the day on the grounds and some appropriate celebration of their visit will be provided for.</p>

                            <p>The Orientals in the Streets of All Nations were entertained yesterday by a sermon by Rt. Rev. Archimandrite Raphael, one of the distinguished and learned bishops of the Orthodox Greek church.  Bishop Raphael was born and educated at Damascus, but is of ancient Greek lineage.  He has traveled extensively and is well known throughout the Levant for his piety and culture.  He came to the exposition direct from Russia, where he has spent many years, and is staying at the residence of Mrs. M. J. Wood, 2111 Pinkney street, where he was tendered a banquet in the Greek style Saturday night by G. T. Jassons of this city.  Covers were laid for ten guests, which included the principal members of the Greek church in this city.  Although the company was small, seven languages, Greek, Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian and English, were spoken around the board.  Prior to the dinner mastica, the national liquor of Greece, was served in small glasses.  The wine also came from the Holy Land and several of the dishes were purely Oriental.  Of these the most notable was the Turkish piloff, a favorite dish in all the Mediterranean countries.</p>

                            <p>Exhibitors in the Agriculture building made another raid upon the sparrows that have been inhabiting that structure.  The slaughter was commenced early yesterday morning and continued until the people commenced to arrive during the afternoon.  The little pests have been causing the Agriculture building exhibitors considerable annoyance and Saturday night, Moore of the Cotton Belt exhibit and Clark of the Hawaiian section chose sides and organized a sparrow hunt to be pulled off yesterday morning.  There were ten men on each side.  Each men was armed with a 22-caliber rifle, the cartridges being loaded with the smallest shot obtainable.</p>
                            <p>It was just after the daylight when the whistle blew the signal for the beginning of the deadly work and from that time until nearly 2 o'clock in the afternoon no person was safe inside the building.  After the hunt an account of stock was taken and it was ascertained that three birds had succumbed to the murderous fire.  As the agreement was that the losers should buy a supper for the winners, Moore and his associate hunters were compelled to pay for the sandwiches and liquid refreshments that were disposed of during the evening.</p>

                            <p>President Sutherlin of the Montana commission is anticipating a big crowd of people here from Montana on Tuesday when the building of that state is to be dedicated.  Secretary of State Collins is already here and is assisting President Sutherlin in working out the details.  He says that the event will be a red-letter day in the history of the exposition and will be one that will not be soon forgotten.</p>
                            <p>Advices have been received that one train of six sleepers and a number of coaches filled with Montana people will leave Billings tonight, coming over the Burlington.  The party contains between 500 and 600 people and another train is expected to leave tomorrow.  It is estimated that close to 1,000 Montana people will be here to participate in the exercises.</p>

                            <p>Canada is adding a large quantity of fruit to its exhibit in International hall.  The fruit comes from the orchards of Ontario and consists of apples, peaches, pears, grapes and plums.</p>
                            <p>A movement is on foot by which during the last month of the exposition Canada expects to have an unusually large exhibit of fruit and vegetables.  The agricultural fairs of Canada are nearly all held during the latter part of the present month.

                            <p>People who visit the fisheries' exhibit in the Government building are often surprised at the immense number of small carp, perch, sunfish and catfish shown in the big tank.  These fish come from the lagoon, which is fairly alive with the little fellows, that are rapidly reaching proportions that make them valuable for frying purposes.</p>
                            <p>Last spring when the fish exhibit was placed there were thousands of little fish from an inch to two inches long.  Not having any use for them, the people in charge of the exhibit placed them in the lagoon, where they have since remained.  They have grown very rapidly and now many of them reach six inches in length.  It is necessary to restock some of the tanks with fresh water fish occasionally and at such times two men with dip nets can catch the required quantity in a few minutes.</p>

                            <p>The exhibit that is being gathered in Oklahoma by Commissioner Riley will reach Omaha about Friday of the present week.

                            <p>There were no Indian dances scheduled for last evening and consequently the Indians spent their time in visiting or sitting about the camp fires, rehearsing the events of other days.  With the Indians who are in the village on the exposition grounds, Sunday is too sacred a day to puncture with dances, notwithstanding the fact that nearly all of the dances have some religious rites running along with them.</p>
                            <p>Today several bands of Indians are expected from the south and west, while still more are looked for within the next few days.  After the camp is complete, Captain Mercer will begin making his arrangements for another sham battle, in which only the Indians will participate.</p>

                            <p>Some of the firemen who have arrived to participate in the tournament came to the exposition yesterday with the impression that they were to be admitted free.  They collided with the gatekeepers, who could not see it in that way, and some of them were indignant because arrangements had not been made to admit them.  They said that they had been assured that they were to have the freedom of the exposition grounds.  If such an impression was given out it was unauthorized by the exposition officials.  And the officers of the firemen say they have never at any time given any one reason to think they would be admitted free to the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <p>Another carload of exhibits from Hawaii has arrived and will be put in place in the space in the Agriculture building as soon as the stuff can be taken out of bond.  Although Hawaii has become a part of the territory of the United States, exhibits sent from that country still have to come in bond, owing to the fact that the necessary official order of recognition has not been issued.  The consignment now in the warehouse consists of dried and canned fruits and the agricultural products of the island.</p>

                            <p>Miss Copeland and Mrs. Thayer, who have been guests at the Iowa state building during the last week, have returned to their home at Chariton, Ia.</p>
                            <p>The success of the carnival Friday night is indicated by the fact that there were 2,919 paid admissions after 6 o'clock.  Of these at least 2,000 are credited to the drawing power of the carnival.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Sutherlin, wife of President Sutherlin of the Montana state building, who has been confined to her room for a number of days on account of injuries sustained by falling from a street car, is able to be out again.</p>

                            <p>Secretary James T. Bradshaw of the Southwest Missouri Editorial association, was in the city yesterday, spending most of his time upon the exposition grounds.  He likes the exposition very much and is so well pleased that this year he will bring the southwestern Missouri editors, 250 in number, here.  They will arrive about October 1 and will remain several days.  The annual meeting, or at least a portion of the sessions, will be held in this city.</p>

                            <p>The Missouri Pacific report that <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> outlook for a large attendance at the exposition on Friday is exceptionally bright on account of numerous parties of Woodmen of the World who will visit here on that day.  The Union Pacific, Burlington and Rock Island railroads also expect to bring in big crowds of Colorado people on the same day to celebrate their state day at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A remarkable illustration of the publicity of the exposition in Montana is shown by the arrival of a party of thirty-eight people from Lewiston, Mont., to help celebrate Montana day at the exposition on Tuesday.  The little town of Lewiston is somewhat over 120 miles remote from the nearest railroad station, and the party drove overland to Billings, Mont., to take the train for Omaha.</p>
                            <p>There is a good chance that the reduced rates made for Modern Woodmen day at the exposition will be extended.  The Omaha passenger men have joined in a request to extend the limit on the tickets for this occasion from two to five days, and to increase the radius in which the tickets may be sold from 200 to 300 miles.  Modern Woodmen day will occur on September 22, but tickets for the occasion will be sold as early as September 21.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 6.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;President McKinley has consented to go to Omaha October 12, during the week of the peace jubilee at the Transmississippi Exposition.  He said this much to a delegation of Nebraska citizens who called upon him at the White House at noon today.  The delegation was composed of Senators Thurston and Allen, John L. Webster, John C. Cowin and W. J. Broatch.  Mr. Webster delivered the formal invitation to the president in a short speech which was supplemented by Senator Thurston who said the people of the west wanted to see the president.  Senator Allen said that his people wanted the presidents to come to Omaha and see what triumphs peace had brought.</p>
                            <p>President McKinley hesitated for a moment about replying, but finally said that if public duties would permit he would leave Washington, October 10, in order to reach Omaha Wednesday, October 12.  He was especially anxious to know whether the invitation came from all classes of citizens and from representatives of all parties.  He was assured by both Senators Allen and Thurston that the invitation was universal <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>"In case of my possible coming to Omaha," said the president subsequently, "I have been invited by both William Wallace and General Manderson to be their guest, but I feel that I am wholly in the hands of the committee and have therefore not accepted these kind offers."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Thurston stated that arrangements would be made with the Omaha club to turn the entire club over to the president and his guests during his stay in Omaha, members of the club having consented to be excluded for forty-eight hours.  Senator Thurston said that the club house was most commodious and could easily entertain ten to twenty guests.  This struck the president most forcibly and he said that these arrangements would suit him immensely.</p>
                            <p>Before the delegation left President McKinley said:  "Now, gentlemen, I want it understood that my going to Omaha is at the request of all citizens and of no particular faction.  My visit must be non-political.  I shall bring with me as many of my official family as can be spared from their departments.  The ride is a long one, but I have no doubt inconveniences will be reduced to the minimum."</p>
                            <p>When asked as to whether he would like to stop in Chicago the president expressed a wish that the train by run through to Omaha without any great loss of time, as he wanted a good night's rest on Tuesday if such a thing were possible.</p>
                            <p>The president looked bronzed and rugged, there was the light of health in his eye and to those about him he said his outing from which he returned this morning had been vastly beneficial.</p>
                            <p>Postmaster General Emory Smith, who was present when the delegation presented the invitation to the president, together with Secretaries Gage and Alger, said that while he was booked for a speech in Omaha on Pennsylvania day, October 5, he was somewhat tempted to go with the president on his trip and abandon the proposed visit during the first week of October.</p>
                            <p>The committee assured President McKinley that a train would be provided for himself and his guests and that a hearty western welcome should be his.</p>

                            <p>While Montana did not send quite as big a crowd to celebrate its state day as has been contributed by nearer and more populous states, there were enough of its citizens on the grounds to make a conspicuous and thoroughly representative addition to the usual exposition crowd.  They were almost without exception entirely new to the exposition, and with weather that was fairly suggestive of their own invigorating climate they were among the most enthusiastic visitors that have been welcomed to the transmississippi show.  There were enough of them to form a very respectable audience in the Auditorium irrespective of those who found it impossible to remain inside when there were so many attractions to invite them elsewhere.  They were hugely delighted with the resemblance between Governor Holcomb and Governor Smith which was very noticeable as they sat together on the platform and each of the executives caught the crowd by relating his experiences on the occasions when he had been mistaken for the other.</p>
                            <p>Preliminary to the exercises of the day the Omaha Concert band, which has just begun a two weeks' engagement on the grounds, entertained the crowd with a short program.</p>

                            <p>Its performance compared very favorably with those of the larger bands that have been heard at the exposition and each selection was heartily applauded.  The official party arrived soon after 11 o'clock accompanied by Thiele's Musical Union band and after more music Vice President Sutherlin of Montana, introduced Governor Holcomb, who welcomed the visitors to Nebraska.  He declared that their greeting is no less sincere because they have not come in as large numbers as the people of more adjacent states.  Nebraska is honored that so many of them have come so far.</p>
                            <p>The speaker called attention to the fact that the two states no longer seem foreign to each other.  The development of the railroad has brought them close together and they are now neighbors.  While it represents the entire transmississippi country, this exposition is no less an exponent of the resources and products of Montana.  These the speaker briefly eulogized and proceeded to compliment Governor Smith and again expressed the welcome with which he had prefaced his address.</p>

                            <p>In replying to the sentiments of the previous speaker, Governor R. B. Smith of Montana said that this year has proven to the world a part of the greatness of our nation.  A foreign war has been successfully prosecuted and at the same time a few sparsely settled states in the west have brought together one of the most magnificent expositions the world has ever seen.  Montana feels a just pride in being invited to participate in these exercises, and also that it has been able to contribute towards building this exposition.  Its people are warmly appreciative of the hearty welcome they have received and they can be depended on to stand for the interests of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Continuing Governor Smith spoke of the vast resources of his state in proportion to its population.  He quoted the annual product of gold and silver, coal, wool and other staples.  In 1897 with a population of only 250,000 it produced over $70,000,000.  It is the greatest mineral producing state in the union and if its arable land was put in a compact body it would make a state bigger than Iowa that would produce more bushels of grain per acre than any other soil in the United States.  Even its own people do not realize the agricultural possibilities of the state.  Its climate is salubrious and its people are rugged, hearty and honest.  In the recent war it furnished the first volunteer regiment to be mustered in.  Allotted a <choice><sic>quoto</sic><corr>quota</corr></choice> of 524 men, it furnished 1,366.  He commented on the fact that of these only one had died and very few had been sick, and contended that this is the result of the sturdy health of which the climate of Montana is productive.</p>
                            <p>In behalf of the exposition management President Wattles emphasized the welcome previously extended by Governor Holcomb.  He declared that no state in the union is entitled to more credit at this exposition than Montana.  Although one of the youngest states in the union and burdened by the expense of creating and constructing state institutions, it responded to the invitation to participate in the enterprise in a manner that left no doubt of the public spirit of its citizens.  Particular mention was made of the $15,000 contribution of Marcus Daly that had made the handsome exhibit of the state possible.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles spoke in enthusiastic terms of the natural resources of Montana, which could furnish sustenance to half the population of the nation and predicted for the state a future of unexampled prosperity.</p>
                            <p>There were several other speakers on the program, but on account of the hour they decided that lunch would be more enjoyable than further oratory.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee devoted last evening to making a series of formal calls upon the representatives of the various states at the state buildings on the Bluff tract.  Owing to the fact that some of the buildings are not provided with faculties for lighting them at night the committee started on its rounds before dark, taking in these buildings first.  The others were reached after dark and it was after 9 o'clock before the demands of formal etiquette had been complied with.  This visit was the first the committee had made as a body to the state buildings and it was also the first time some of the members had been in some of these buildings.  This fact was so plainly in evidence in some of the buildings that bystanders made remarks about it.</p>
                            <p>No especial preparations had been made at any of the buildings to entertain the visitors, as the notice of the coming of the committee, sent out last week, expressly stated that the visit was to be an informal one.  The people at the Nebraska state building had a punch bowl filled with the ingredients commonly contained in such vessels and the discussion of the contents of this served to slightly thaw the ice which has existed between the executive committee and the Nebraska commission.</p>

These guns are expected to arrive some time this week.</p>
                            <p>The war balloons have been shipped from Tampa and are due to arrive in Omaha this week.

                            <div3>
                            <p>Today promises to be one of the landmarks in the history of the exposition, having been set apart as a time for doing honor to the members of the Second regiment of Nebraska volunteers.  It is expected that large numbers of people will visit the grounds to spend the day with the soldiers, inspecting the exposition and taking part in the exercises which will form a part of the day's program.  Members of the regiment have been visiting the grounds singly and in small parties since the arrival of the regiment in Omaha, but the boys will own the entire show today, and they and their sweethearts and friends will be given a hearty welcome.</p>
                            <p>A slight change has been made in the arrangements for bringing the regiment into the grounds.  Instead of entering at the north gate the regiment will enter at the Twenty-fourth street gate and march through the main court to the bluff tract, passing in review at the music pavilion and listening to a few short speeches from Governor Holcomb, Mayor Moores and others.</p>

                            <p>Another big war dance took place on the Indian congress grounds yesterday afternoon in the presence of a larger crowd than had ever before assembled on these grounds to witness the ceremonies which are exemplified by the representatives of the many Indian tribes which constitute the congress.  The dance was one of the best which has been given, and the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the novelty of the sight, while the historic interest of the ceremony was not lost sight of.</p>
                            <p>It was nearly 6 o'clock before the dance was at its height, but from that time until long after dark the wild gyrations were kept up with short intervals of rest, and the interest of the spectators was maintained to the last.  Nearly 200 Indian braves were in the ring and the sight was awe-inspiring to those whose residence on the western frontier during the early days served to <choice><sic>remnd</sic><corr>remind</corr></choice> them of similar ceremonies when the wild sight was no idle dream.</p>
                            <p>The music (?) for the occasion was furnished by the Crows, certain of the members of this tribe being considered singers of great ability.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MIMIC NAVAL BATTLE.</head>
                            <p>Arrangements have been made between the exposition management and Imre Kiralfy by which the great naval spectacle now creating such furore at the Madison Square garden in New York City will be reproduced on the exposition grounds during the month of October.  This spectacle is a faithful representation of a naval conflict, thirty fighting ships of various kinds taking part in the battle, and the booming of cannon, the bursting of shells and all other accompaniments of a naval battle being produced in the most realistic manner.  Mr. Kiralfy will reproduce the noted battles of the Spanish-American war.</p>
                            <p>These battles will take place on the north tract of the exposition grounds at the point where the fireworks have been displayed.  The lake will be enlarged and the grounds will be enclosed.  The boats used in this spectacle are about thirty feet in length and the whole affair is on a grand scale.</p>
                            <p>This spectacle will be one of the features of Peace Jubilee week, October 10 to 15, and it is expected to prove a strong drawing card.</p>
                            <p>They would not command very extensive salaries on the operatic stage, although their execution was on a par with that of certain alleged operatic comedians who have afflicted Omaha audiences.</p>
                            <p>The war dance is a great favorite with the Indians and they never miss an opportunity to indulge in it.  They are not allowed to perform this dance on any of the reservations, all of the Indian agents being under instructions to prevent it by force, if necessary.  The ghost dance is placed in the same category by Uncle Sam and his wards are not allowed to indulge their fondness for these ceremonies.  The opportunity to gratify their taste to the utmost is, therefore, eagerly seized upon by the Indians and the amount of satisfaction depicted upon even the expressionless faces of the old men is interesting to behold.  It is urged that the indulgence of this dance will counteract the civilizing influences which have been thrown around the Indians on the reservations and arouse the old spirit and a thirst for new victories.</p>
                            <p>Officers connected with the congress who have made Indian affairs the study of a lifetime, while opposing the idea of allowing these dance to be given, say that the demoralizing influence will not be as great as is claimed by those who are urging that they be abandoned.  These officers say that the civilizing effect, even upon the old Indians, of the exposition will more than offset any evil effects which might otherwise follow these dances.</p>
                            <p>The number of Indians at the congress is constantly increasing, representatives of new tribes arriving every week.  Within a few days a delegation of about twenty of the Pueblo Indians will arrive at the exposition, being the first representatives of this tribe to arrive.  Among other tribes which <unclear reason="torn"/> Northern Cheyennes from Montana and the Pawnees and Otoes from Oklahoma.  Mr. James Mooney, one of the officials of the Indian bureau, is now in the southwest securing representative Indians from the tribes of the Kiowas, Comanches, Wichitas, Delawares and others now living on reservations in that section.</p>

                            <p>W. N. Nason, manager of the Free Masons' headquarters in the Nebraska building, has been devoting his leisure moments to compiling a tabulation showing the states from which the Free Masons hail who daily visit the rooms and register their names in the big book for the purpose.  This book is to be filed among the archives of the Omaha Masonic bodies and preserved as a memento of the exposition, and the compilation made by Mr. Nason shows that the book will contain the names of members of the craft from every quarter of the country.</p>
                            <p>This tabulation shows that up to date 2,560 Free Masons have registered, and Mr. Nason says that only about one in five stop to register.  The states represented in this tabulation are as follows, the number showing the number who have registered:  Nebraska 1,346, Iowa 401, Missouri 142, Kansas 140, Illinois 123, Minnesota 64, South Dakota 54, Wisconsin 35, Colorado 30, Pennsylvania 22, Indiana 18, Ohio 15, New York 17, California 13, Texas 19, and many other states with a lesser number, representing every state in the union.</p>

                            <p>The exhibit of Los Angeles county, California, in the Horticulture building, has been increased by the addition of a new supply of fresh fruit, including several varieties of grapes, apples, pears, plums, etc.  Among the grapes which are especially noticeable are the Black Morocco, the Flame Tokay, Cornishon and Muskat, the bunches in each case being simply immense and the flavor delicious.  In apples there are the Western Beauty, Alexander, the old Bellflower and several others, all of large size and splendid flavor.  A decided novelty is the Kelsey Japanese plum, a dark green fruit, resembling a pear in appearance and size.</p>
                            <p>A new departure in this exhibit is the addition of a lot of canned fish, illustrating an extensive industry in Southern California.  In order to demonstrate the excellence of this product visitors to the exhibit will be served at intervals with small samples of the dainty morsels.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Preparing to Advertise the Great Event of the Year's History.</head>
                            <p>The announcement that President McKinley will be here on October 12 to attend the Peace Jubilee at the exposition was received nowhere more heartily than in railway circles.  The date of the president's coming has been awaited with great interest by the advertising agents of all the lines entering the city, and they immediately began work on a great amount of advertising material of various forms.  No other special occasion of the exposition has been as widely advertised by the railroads as the president's coming will be, and the passenger men are already predicting that they will bring in more people to Omaha than <choice><sic>ony</sic><corr>on</corr></choice> any former occasion within the history of the city.</p>
                            <p>Reduced rates for the Peace Jubilee have not yet been made.  The committee of the Western Passenger association having the matter in charge has been waiting to learn the exact date of the president's coming before taking any action.  The committee consists of Assistant General Passenger Agent Smith of the B. &amp; M., Merrill of the Milwaukee and MacRae of the Omaha road.  It will meet in Omaha this week.</p>
                            <p>There has already sprung up a rivalry among the four Omaha-Chicago lines for transporting the presidential party between the two cities.  It is expected that President McKinley and his party will occupy a special train of the Pennsylvania road.  The Pennsylvania connects directly with the Burlington and with the Milwaukee lines in Chicago and many railroaders think one of these two roads will be sure to capture the honor.  It would be easy to transfer the train to any other road, however, and the Union

                            Pacific officials are of the opinion that the Northwestern will secure the party.  It's understood that Vice President Truesdale of the Rock Island will personally endeavor to convince the president that he should come over that line.  General Manderson will advocate the use of the Burlington and General Western Agent Fred A. Nash of the Milwaukee has gone to Chicago to lay his lines for the party.  In this he will be assisted by General Cowin, who is the legal representative of the Milwaukee road and who is a close friend of the president.  There is no money in the haul for any of the roads, but all of them are head-over-heels in the scramble to have the honor of announcing that President McKinley and party will use their line from Chicago to Omaha and return.</p>

                            <p>Marching columns of sun-browned soldiers in the blue and brown of the volunteer service, shrill bugle calls, and the glint of the bright sunlight on innumerable rifle barrels, endowed the exposition with a martial interest today.  The officers and men of the Second Nebraska regiment received a royal welcome to the great enterprise that their state had produced while they were languishing under a tropical sun.  Nothing was lacking that could add to the hearty sincerity of their greeting.  One of Nebraska's most beautiful September days, speeches of welcome that briefly expressed sentiments that were heartfelt, and the more informal greeting of thousands of their friends, combined to make their day at the exposition a holiday of unalloyed enjoyment.</p>
                            <p>The presence of the soldiers brought out their relatives and friends from all over the state to assist in making them welcome and during the morning the people poured through the gates by thousands.  All the attractions of the show were apparently forgotten and the crowd lined up in solid phalanx along the main court to catch the first glimpse of the soldiers as they entered the grounds and express its greeting in hearty cheers.  The regiment arrived at the Twenty-fourth street entrance a little after 10 o'clock, and here it was met by Governor Holcomb, Adjutant General Barry and Military Secretary Ayris, who carried the Nebraska colors.  They were mounted on three perfectly matched white horses, and as the head of the parade entered the grounds they fell into line and preceded the soldiers on their march to the reviewing stand.  The Second Regiment band came next and was followed by Colonel C. J. Bills and staff and the three battalions of the regiment in platoons.  They swung around the mirror in magnificent alignment, while the crowd that was massed on the bridges and along both sides of the lagoon vented its enthusiasm in a succession of cheers.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Some Perfect Evolutions.</head>
                            <p>The line of march was along the north side of the lagoon to the viaduct, where the regiment fell into columns of fours and passed over the bridge and down the Bluff tract to the Horticultural building.  Thence back to the Plaza, where it was reviewed by Governor Holcomb, the exposition officials and others.  The regiment fell into company formation as it reached the Plaza and executed one or two very pretty movements as it circled round the open space and fell into line in front of the band stand.</p>
                            <p>From the band stand Governor Holcomb, Adjutant General Barry, President Wattles and Manager Babcock of the exposition, Mayor Moores, Governor Smith of Montana and other admired the excellent appearance made by the volunteers and as it dropped into the solid formation Adjutant General Barry stepped forward and very briefly made them welcome to their state.  He complimented them on their magnificent appearance and on the splendid record that they had made during their absence and introduced Governor Holcomb who gave them a somewhat more elaborate greeting.  Governor Holcomb declared that in doing this he was not merely expressing an empty sentiment.  It was a greeting that was heartfelt.  "You have won," he said, "a warm place in the heart of every citizen of Nebraska, and I but bespeak the sentiment of all when I say that they are proud of their soldier boys who went to the front in this war.  They have done nothing but credit to themselves, their state, the nation and the flag that we all love."</p>
                            <p>The speaker emphasized the statement that although the regiment had not been engaged in active hostilities, it had done its full duty and contributed its share to the glorious results achieved.  The question is not whether they were at Santiago, or Manila, but whether, when the call was heard, they had left their homes, shouldered their rifles and marched away to do their duty.  This they had done and done it nobly.</p>
                            <p>Continuing Governor Holcomb said that it was observed with sadness that the ranks were thinned.  This emphasizes the sacrifices they have made.  Not all the sacrifice of war is made in actual combat.  They are made every day by everyone who has been engaged in the war, and every officer and private has contributed toward the glorious result.  In conclusion the governor paid a high tribute to the volunteer soldiery of this country that has been its defense from 1776 to 1898.</p>

                            <p>Mayor Moores then extended a brief but very happy welcome in behalf of the city of Omaha.  He said that thirty-three years ago he and his comrades had come marching home again as they had done now to receive the welcome of the girls they had left behind them.  He emphatically declared that the heroes of the Second regiment could have the freedom of the city and everything it contained.  What other country could, in six months, raise an army of 200,000 men and lick the enemy, as we have licked them?  And then in this struggle every trace of the Mason and Dixon line had been wiped out and the victory had been won by the boys in blue and gray, who marched shoulder to shoulder.  He repeated his welcome in the heartiest manner and assured the soldiers that if they wanted anything they did not see, to apply to the mayor.</p>
                            <p>Then the Omaha Concert band struck up the "Star Spangled Banner."  Colonel Bills lifted his hat and in an instant every head on the Plaza was bare while the inspiring melody continued.  After the music Colonel Bills was introduced to respond to the addresses of the previous speakers, which he did in a particularly graceful manner.  He repeated the wail of the French soldier after the Franco-Prussian war, who said:</p>
                            <lg>
                                <l>When the battle is on and danger is nigh,</l>
                                <l>God and the soldier is all their cry;</l>
                                <l>But when all is over and the wrong is righted,</l>
                                <l>God is forgotten and the soldier is slighted.</l>
                            </lg>
                            <p>He said that that might be true in France, but we live under the Stars and Stripes.  "I am proud," he continued, "that we have been welcomed home with the same enthusiasm with which we were bidden god-speed when we started.  I want to tell the people of Nebraska that their soldiers have done their duty.  You boys did not get into a battle but you have performed what makes a man a soldier.  You have obeyed orders, and no soldier can do more."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">And They All Cheer "Dixie."</head>
                            <p>The regimental band played a patriotic medley, and as the music ran into "Dixie" the concert band on the platform joined in the chorus, and this elicited another burst of cheers from the soldiers, in which they received enthusiastic co-operation from the crowd.  President Wattles ended the exercises with a short address, in which he gave the soldiers a hearty welcome to the exposition.  He eulogized the record that they had made during their service and extended to them an urgent invitation to again enjoy the freedom of the grounds on the occasion of a great Peace Jubilee, which their efforts had made possible.</p>
                            <p>As President Wattles concluded the buglers sounded the "mess call," which was greeted with a rousing cheer by the volunteers.  The companies marched off and stacked arms on each side of the Plaza and were thence conducted to the south casino, which had been reserved exclusively for the banquet that was tendered them by the exposition.  The First battalion and half of the Second <unclear reason="torn"/> dined first and then the remainder of this regiment, which had been waiting with as much grace as it could muster, succeeded them at the tables.  There was no ceremony about the dinner.  It was a case of supplying provender to hungry soldiers in the quickest possible time and the task was very satisfactorily executed.  After dinner the soldiers were turned loose to enjoy the afternoon and evening free from restraint or discipline, and most of them were received by groups of personal friends, who left nothing undone to make the remainder of their holiday equally enjoyable.</p>

                            <p>Everything is hurry and bustle at the Indian camp on account of the preparations being made for the sham battle that will take place next Saturday evening between the Sioux on one side and the allied forces upon the other.  During these days the Indians are up before daylight and are rehearsing for the event and never was there a time when any theatrical company worked harder.  Each morning, shortly after 5 o'clock, Bill Liddiard, better known as "Rattlesnake Pete," blows a fog horn whistle and a few minutes later the Indians roll out of their tepees.  For an hour they skulk through the grass, among the trees and perform all of the acts Indians are supposed to indulge in when upon the warpath.</p>
                            <p>At the last sham battle, Captain Mercer took a lot of white men into his confidence to play a part, but he will have no more of that.  At the next fight, only Indians will take a hand and they will make the battle the most realistic ever seen.  It will be fought upon the grounds in front of the quarters now occupied by the tepees.  The tepees will be torn down or moved back, so that the whole field can be occupied by the contending forces.  All of the Indians, some 300, will be mounted.  The Sioux will be stationed on the open ground at the east end while the representatives of the other tribes will be scattered from the central portion down into the little grove in the extreme southwest corner.  As yet the general plan of battle has not been arranged, though it is known that the Sioux will charge the camp.  These Indians of the plains will be presumed to be returning from an incursion into the enemies' country, and when reaching the borders of their own land, they will observe a party of hostile Indians and will at once prepare for the attack.  The Sioux will be mounted, as will nearly all of the other Indians.</p>
                            <p>At the practice yesterday morning the scalping act was performed to perfection, and seemed to real to some of the Indians that the interpreters had to produce pretty strong argument to assure the participants that it was not a hair raising occasion.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Imre Kiralfy to Produce His Great Spectacle on the Lagoon.</head>
                            <p>In addition to the great attractions that have already been scheduled for the last month of the exposition Kiralfy's mammoth spectacle, "Our Naval Victories," is now assured.  This will be put on the mirror at the west end of the lagoon, which will be surrounded by a temporary amphitheater which will seat 12,000 people.  Beginning October 9, two performances of this big production will be given daily, and exposition visitors will be given a portrayal of the battles of Manila and Santiago and the maneuvers of the fleets that will be almost equal to an actual view of the conflicts.  The contract with Mr. Kiralfy provides for a fleet of over thirty ships representing every type of fighting vessel.  These miniature ships are from fifteen to twenty-one feet long and are exact reproductions of the ships that they are designed to represent.  The North Atlantic squadron will be represented by the New York, Brooklyn, Oregon, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Texas, Montgomery, New Orleans, Marblehead and Gloucester.  Of the Pacific fleet, commanded by Admiral Dewey, there will be the Olympia, Boston, Baltimore, Raleigh, Concord and Petrel.  There will also be eight Spanish ships, including the Cristobal Colon, Vizcaya, Maria Teresa, Reina Mercedes, Furor and Terror.  In addition to these war ships there will be dispatch boats, sailing craft and newspaper yachts.  There will also be an exact reproduction in miniature of the collier Merrimac, which is constructed after designs furnished by Lieutenant Hobson himself.</p>
                            <p>By an elaborate system of stage settings and mechanical devices the various scenes of the war are depicted with a realism that is said to be marvelous.  Naval officers who have seen the production in New York declare that it is absolutely accurate in every detail.  The first scene represents the North Atlantic fleet on the eve of war.  Two squadrons appear in a series of maneuvers in which the handling of the ships and the use of signals is illustrated.  Then a third squadron composed of the big battleships arrives, followed by the flagship New York, and then by the Nashville with the Buena

                            Ventura, the first prize of the war.  The fleet then departs to blockade Havana and its departure is accompanied by an exhibition of gun and torpedo practice in which the accuracy of the American gunners is demonstrated.</p>
                            <p>The next scene is laid in the Pacific and finds the Boston and Concord reconnoitering outside Manila bay.  The Spanish fleet is dimly visible inside the harbor and Spanish merchantmen are passing back and forth over the water.  The Boston and Concord report to the flagship and the fleet then enters the harbor, led by the Olympia.  Then the guns speak and the miniature ships go through the identical maneuvers that Admiral Dewey used during the fight.  Every detail of the battle is brought out, even to the rest for breakfast.  Then the forts are silenced, the Spanish ships are burned and sunk and the white flag is raised over Cavite.</p>
                            <p>The battle of Santiago is portrayed in the third scene and preliminary to the bombardment a number of familiar incidents of the blockade are introduced.  Spanish vessels are seen chasing American ships and among others the press boat Anita is pursued and fired on.  Then a great storm impend and during the play of the elements Cervera's fleet is discovered making its way into the harbor.  This is reported to Schley and Sampson and the forts are bombarded.  Then the Oregon joins the fleet after its long trip around the Horn and two Spanish torpedo boats which attempt to blow up the Brooklyn and Texas are sent back demoralized by their quick-firing guns.  The incident of the sinking of the Merrimac follows and every detail is graphically reproduced.  Then the firing of the soldiers who are storming El Caney is heard and the Vesuvius stirs up Morro castle with its dynamite shells.  There is a pause in hostilities and then follows the attempted escape of the Spanish fleet and the terrific attack of the American ships.</p>
                            <p>The fourth scene represents peace and the victorious navy celebrates its successes in a grand naval review, which terminates with magnificent illuminations and fireworks.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Officials and Other Interested Rejoiced at News from Washington.</head>
                            <p>Not only the exposition officials, but everyone on the grounds were delighted to learn yesterday that President McKinley had consented to come on the very date that the management had desired.  If another day had been selected it would have been necessary to make an entire change in the program that had already been arranged, but now the enterprise can be carried out under the most favorable conditions.</p>
                            <p>The first intimation of the successful result of the visit of the special committee was received by President Wattles yesterday afternoon in a telegram from John L. Webster, which stated that the committee had met the president and the members of his cabinet and that the president had consented to come October 12 and bring all the members of his cabinet who could be spared from their official duties at Washington.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Webster also wired President Wattles that there is now on exhibition at Minneapolis a collection of interesting war relics, which could be secured for the exposition at a small expense for express charges.  President Wattles answered at once, directing Mr. Webster to make the necessary arrangements and it is expected that the collection will be in Omaha as soon as it can be packed and shipped.  It includes a number of valuable relics of the Santiago fight, including the flags of the Oregon and Christobol Colon and relics of the Vizcaya, Reina Mercedes and Maria Teresa.  Among other articles are a mine from Guantanamo bay and a flask which was previously the property of Maximo Gomez and was used by him in the field.</p>

                            <p>DENVER, Colo., Sept. 5.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  In justice to the Illinois commission and others concerned permit me to correct a misleading report in your paper of the proceedings at the Illinois building Friday evening, where the reporter speaks of the "elegant entertainment and dance tendered by Major and Mrs. Hambleton at the conclusion of the masked carnival, which was one of the leading events of the week."  The report should have read something like the following:</p>
                            <p>The Illinois commission extended courtesies in the way of an informal reception at its magnificent building Friday evening, September 2, to the members of the National Editorial association of the United States, suggested more especially because of the genial and efficient corresponding secretary, Mr. J. M. Page, of the Jerseyville Democrat, being an Illinois man.  The hours for the reception were between 9 and 11 o'clock and scores of the editors and their ladies promptly assembled.  Refreshments in abundance were served and the occasion <unclear reason="torn"/> with music by a first class mandolin orchestra.  Many of the officials of the exposition were present, including President Wattles, General Manager Clarkson, Edward Rosewater and others.  At about 10 o'clock the assemblage was called to order in the north parlor by Mr. C. H. Keeler, a representative of the Illinois commission, also a member of the editorial association, having been requested by President Carr, Chairman Harper and other members of the executive committee to make arrangements for the event.  Mr. Hambleton, the secretary, was introduced and in his usual felicitous manner delivered a few well chosen words of welcome, which were <choice><sic>respended</sic><corr>responded</corr></choice> to by Louis Holtman of Brazil, Ind., president of the association.  Others were called upon, the first to respond being President Wattles, followed by Edward Rosewater, Mr. Chappell of Boston and others.  The short talks concluded, the party dispersed delighted with what they were pleased to call one of the most pleasant experiences of their visit to the great exposition.</p>
                            <p>It hardly seems fair to me, Mr. Editor, to ignore the real feature of the evening and give such prominence to a little matter that was merely incidental to it.</p>

The executive committee has decided to make this a concession and it will be handled like any other concession contract.  The maximum prices which the successful bidder will be allowed to charge exhibitors are designated in the following scale:  Choice prairie upland hay, $10 per ton; good straw, baled, $7 per ton; cracked and ground corn, $16 per ton; corn and oats, chopped (quarter oats), $16 per ton; bran, $14 per ton; oil meal (old process), $30 per ton; tame hay, $12 per ton; shorts, $14 per ton; oats, white No. 3 or better, 30 cents per bushel; corn, shelled, No. 3 or better, 40 cents per bushel.</p>

                            <p>Twenty-five Indians from the Rosebud agency have arrived at the Indian camp and have been located in the vicinity of the other Sioux.  They are all fine looking Indians and closely resemble the members of the other Sioux tribes.</p>
                            <p>The Sioux Indians now outnumber all others combined and their camp at the east end of the grounds is the favorite resort for the visitors.  While they are not very talkative, they are more friendly and sociable than some of the others and consequently they are the favorites.</p>
                            <p>Joe Tesson and his band of Sacs and Foxes have returned to the agency near Tama City, Ia., where they will remain until their crop of corn is harvested.  It is expected that a number of them will return next month to remain until the close of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Captain Mercer has gone to the Omaha reservation, where he will remain several days, looking after some business matters that demand his attention.  He will return in time for Saturday's sham battle between the members of the Indian tribes.</p>

                            <p>Music Director Kelly has made a change in the music arrangement.  Instead of having the entire concert of the Omaha Concert band given in one place the band played half an hour in front of the Government building.  After the life-saving exhibition it moved on to the Fine Arts building and played fifteen minutes, then a similar length of time at the Liberal Arts, another at Mines and Mining and finally at the Auditorium.  This plan is especially well received by the exhibitors, as it has a tendency to keep the people moving from one building to another instead of holding them in one place.</p>

                            <head type="sub">People of World's Fair City Urged to Make It Memorable.</head>
                            <ab>Chicago Chronicle.</ab>
                            <p>The managers of the splendid Omaha exposition have set apart October 1 as Chicago day.  It should be made a memorable event.  There should be an effort in Chicago and in all northern Illinois to make it the greatest day of the season.  It will be an unusual opportunity for the citizens of this part of the country to form or to renew an acquaintance with the people who live west of the Missouri river.</p>
                            <p>A statement of the accounts of the Omaha exposition shows that it will be successful in financial affairs.  The receipts will be sufficient to pay off the debt incurred in all the work of preparation, the floating debt of the management and other obligations.  Three-fourths of the amount has been already discharged.  The daily receipts are increasing and the prospect is that a surplus will remain after all the expenses of the fair shall have been paid.</p>
                            <p>It will be recollected that a somewhat similar experience was met by the managers of the World's fair in Chicago in 1893.  The great panic followed the opening of the fair.  Receipts were light and a prospect of bankruptcy was presented to the corporation having charge of the great display.  But in August and later the attendance, increased, the gate receipts formed daily an immense fund and the last two months of the fair more than made up for the losses of the first three months.</p>
                            <p>Something like this appears to be the experience of the enterprising managers of the Omaha exposition.  The first months were discouraging.  But the later months give promise that the enterprise will in the end meet all the expectations of the managers.  The interests of Chicago, of its trade to the great west, of the business houses which send stocks of goods to the commercial centers of the Missouri valley, of every industrial establishment, will be served by a grand display at Omaha on Chicago day.</p>

                            <p>Records have demonstrated that aside from the special crowds that are attracted by features of particular note Thursday is the best day of the week in point of general attendance.  Most of the people who came in during the first of the week still remain and on that day there is usually a considerable influx of visitors who come about the middle of the week intending to remain until its close.  The combination of these elements with the regular quota of visitors from adjacent towns who come merely for a day or two and return later on usually insures a good Thursday crowd, irrespective of the attractions that are scheduled.  Although there are three celebrations scheduled for today, none of them are of the first magnitude and the drawing power of each is limited to its peculiar circle.  The bulk of the delegates to the convention of the Nebraska State Pharmaceutical association are on the grounds today with their families, the Fraternal Union of America is represented in some degree and Alexander Hogeland is scheduled to speak in the Auditorium this afternoon

                            on subjects suggested by his work among the newsboys.  But these features are secondary to the main show which is bringing in the usual good Thursday crowd.  The morning attendance was decidedly heavy and with a recurrence of the magnificent weather that has made exposition visitation a delight during the last few days there is every indication that the grounds will be well crowded before night.</p>

                            <head type="sub">After the Ex-Presidents.</head>
                            <p>There is an encouraging prospect that all the living ex-presidents of the United <choice><sic>tates</sic><corr>States</corr></choice> will join President McKinley in participating in the celebration of President's day of Jubilee week.  As there are only two of them the retired executives will not constitute a numerous party, but their presence will make the occasion memorable as the only time since the revolutionary days when the president and all the living ex-presidents have been brought together to participate in a common undertaking.  President Wattles has received assurance that induce him to believe that both Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland can be induced to come to Omaha during Jubilee week and he telegraphed to the special committee that went to Washington to proffer the formal invitation to President McKinley to proceed to Princeton and extend a similar invitation to Mr. Cleveland.  On the return trip the committee will stop at Indianapolis and endeavor to secure the consent of Mr. Harrison to add his presence to the occasion.  Even the World's Fair included no event of such paramount importance as the Jubilee now promises to become and the managers of the exposition are thoroughly elated over the prospect.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has made one or two changes in the program that has previously been outlined, which will make it even more elaborate.  It is now proposed to begin the Jubilee Sunday, October 9, instead of Monday, and to have the opening exercises partake of a religious character.  Monday will then be a general reception day and Tuesday will be Governors' day.  President Wattles will at once send formal invitations to the governors of all the states to be present with their official staffs and it is believed that with very few exceptions these will be accepted.  Wednesday will be President's day as previously decided, but the army and navy celebrations including the reunion of the veterans of the north and south and soldiers of the recent war will be massed in a big celebration Thursday.  Friday will be marked by a civil celebration in which the cabinet officers, judges of the supreme and federal courts, all federal officials, senators, congressmen and government officials generally will participate.  Saturday the Jubilee will close with a great industrial demonstration and will be known as Peace day.</p>
                            <p>Arrangements have been made by which the members of the Second Nebraska regiment, who were the guests of the exposition yesterday, will be sent home on a thirty days' furlough to rest and recuperate.  Then they will be brought back to Fort Omaha to be mustered out and this will bring them here at the right time to participate in the Jubilee celebration.  President Wattles is also negotiating to secure a detail of cavalry to represent that arm of the service.  He has received the assurance that he can have two troops of cavalry and the band from Fort Meade if the exposition will bring them here and take them back again.  He is now figuring with the railroads on the question of transportation and if this can be satisfactorily adjusted these troops will be here for the entire week.</p>

                            <p>Plans for the Melon day festivities which will be observed tomorrow were completed last night and today everything will be ready for the crowd that will feast on melons furnished by the Rocky Ford Melon Growers' association of Rocky Ford, Colo.</p>
                            <p>The melons that are to be given away arrived yesterday and will be taken to the exposition grounds this afternoon.  There are twenty-two carloads of the fruit.  The number of the melons aggregate 312,500, of which 150,000 are watermelons and the balance cantaloupe.  The tent in which the melons are to be served has been located on the lawn just south of the gate in the rear of the Georgia state building.  It is a whopper, being 60x90, with walls eight feet high.  Around the walls on the inside tables two feet high and three feet wide have been placed.  On top of these tables the melons will be carved by twelve experts who have been brought from Colorado for the purpose.  They will be stationed at regular intervals and will hand out both kinds of melons to all who pass down the aisles.  The surplus melons will be piled under the tables and in great heaps in the center of the tents.  Anticipating a great rush, extra guards will be detailed to keep the crowd moving in order that the space within the tent may not become <choice><sic>conjested</sic><corr>congested</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>Senator Swink, president of the Rocky Ford Melon Growers' association, together with Members Mumford and Dawley, will have the distribution of melons in hand and will look after the handling of the fruit and will see that no person goes away without being satisfied.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of Melon day, President Swink said yesterday: "We have millions of melons out in the vicinity of Rock Ford and we propose to show the people who visit the exposition that they are of the best quality and as free as water.  This year the Rocky Ford melons are unusually fine and abundant and our people will feel great pride in having them sampled by the people from the transmississippi states.  The location of our tent is superb, being just inside the gate near the Horticulture building.  People can leave the street cars at this point and eat their fill of melons before starting out on a tour of the grounds."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Beautiful Display Given to Wind Up a Busy Day.</head>
                            <note type="handwritten">Second Nebraska</note>
                            <p>It would be hard to conceive of a more fitting close for Military day than the display of fireworks on the North tract last night.  The members of the executive committee of the exposition informed John Due, the chief pyrotechnicer, that they wanted him to put up something appropriate for the entertainment of the soldier boys, and he did so.  The soldiers saw the fireworks and so did everybody else apparently, for all <del>of Cummins'</del> reserved seats were occupied, as was all of the standing room for blocks around.  The soldiers occupied 1,000 camp chairs at the northwest corner of the grounds, <del>the use of which was donated by Concessionaire Cummins, who hauled them on the grounds and had them in place long ere the first bomb was fired.</del></p>
                            <p>The flight of rockets and bombs was double that of former nights and the three-shot shells were the first tried.  They worked to perfection and exploded just at the right time to produce the desired effect.  There were fifty of these.  They were shot 1,000 feet into the air and on exploding sent out red fire, from the center of which dropped a ball, which in its downward course <choice><sic>bursted</sic><corr>burst</corr></choice> and shot out silver stars.  This in turn dropped a ball, which when exploded gave out a shower of red, white and blue stars.</p>
                            <p>The first set piece was a picture of President McKinley, with a floral wreath around his name.  The likeness was good and was loudly cheered, but the cheers for it were no louder than for the piece designated as "Our hero, Dewey," which showed the head and shoulders, together with the insignia of his rank.</p>
                            <p>The feature of the display was the sea fight between two war ships, one an American battleship, another a Spanish battleship and the third an American torpedo boat.  The bombardment commenced by the American ship throwing a broadside of shot and shell at the Spaniard that returned the fire.  After this the little torpedo boat sailed out on the lake and let fly a volley of shells at the enemy, several of which struck in the rigging.  The Spaniard sent in another volley, after which the American boats opened with broadsides, keeping it up until the enemy apparently sunk in the lake.</p>
                            <p>The jeweled fan, which has been seen upon former <choice><sic>ocasions</sic><corr>occasions</corr></choice>, was added to the display, this time burning silver fire in connection with the other colors.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ponca Indian Gets Into the Ring Under Suspension of the Rules.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Indians gave another of their war dances last night, fully 150 taking part and trying to keep time to the doleful music pounded out of a drum built for the occasion.  The dance was identical with those given on former occasions, but it drew the crowd just the same.</p>
                            <p>Just as the sun was sinking behind the bluffs, painted a bright red and wearing little else aside from a pair of leggings and a war bonnet of eagle feathers, Knows-no-Fear, a Sioux Indian, jumped into the roped circle and after uttering a war whoop that was distinctly heard down on the Grand Court, recounted some of the deeds of valor that he had performed years ago.  He said that somewhere in the neighborhood of 1860 he met a party of Pawnees down on the South Platte and engaged seven of them single-handed and alone.  There was a fight that lasted two hours, at the end of which four of his assailants bit the dust.</p>
                            <p>The tale told by Mr. Knows-no-Fear seemed to meet with the approval of all of the Sioux of the camp, for they all echoed their approval by giving vent to a number of grunts.  As there were no Pawnees present the story went as gospel truth and the master of ceremonies for the evening.  Little Black Dog, declared the warrior was entitled to lead the dance.  He did lead it and he set a hot pace for some of his associates.  He whirled about the circle with the grace of a whirling dervish and the velocity of a Dakota tornado.  He tired out half a hundred of the other Indians and then seemed to be as fresh as the breezes that blew in from the north.</p>
                            <p>Comes-a-Running is a Cheyenne Indian who has a limp in his gait and also one in his voice.  These impediments are relics he carries around as evidence that once upon a time he was a fighter instead of a coffee cooler, as he is now.  Thirty years ago he was a young man full of a desire to drink blood and take scalps.  So one day when he was in the <choice><sic>heydey</sic><corr>heyday</corr></choice> of youth he left his home at the head of a band of Sioux and started west to add some scalps to his string.  He got out into the wilds of Montana and there met some Indians, but who they were he never knew.  He knows now, however, that they were too many for him and his companions, for after the fight that ensued he found himself with an arrow shot through one leg and another through his cheek, piercing his tongue and carrying away a portion of the member.  He also found that he was the only one of his band who was alive.  Crawling through sage brush, over rocks and along streams he finally struck a band of friendly Indians and was nursed back to life.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">He's a Hummer, Too.</head>
                            <p>After telling the wild and weird tale heretofore detailed the master of ceremonies argued that Comes-a-Running was good enough to participate in most any dance.  All of the other Indians felt the same way and did not hesitate to say so and the old man was let into the ring, the drummer beating out a more doleful sound, if possible, than he had done before.  Comes-a-Running bounded to the front like a rubber ball and all of the Indians followed, though none of them tried to catch the step, nor did he try to keep step to the music.  He had a step of his own and it was one that was fearfully and frightfully made.  He hopped stiff-legged and then on one foot, after which he whirled and whirled, uttering sounds that bore a close resemblance to the dying groans of a cat.  The other Indians tried to pattern after his style, but finding it useless, they set their own pace and kept it up, much to the amusement of the crowd.  This was declared to be the best dance of the evening and if any medals are awarded for dancing this Indian, Comes-a-Running, will get the biggest one in the whole lot.</p>
                            <p>The prettiest dancer of the evening was Little Head, who is the dude of the Poncas.  He is a tall, slim fellow, nearly six feet high and as lithe as a willow.  Upon his shoulders there is a knot that goes for a head.  It is not much larger than a coffee cup, but it is said to be filled with brains of an excellent quality.  Instead of having the awkward shambling movement of the other Indians, this one moves about as lightly as a cat and in his dance last night he skimmed over the ground with the swiftness of a sparrow and the grace of a young man just from a dancing school.  His toggery was similar to that worn by the Indians when dressed for a feast.  Red was the prevailing color and in this he was clad from head to foot, even the feathers in his war bonnet being dyed a bright red hue.  Little Head led the dance, but just why will never be known, unless some Indian gives it away, for he will do nothing of the kind.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Of Course He Could Dance.</head>
                            <p>As has been frequently stated, to entitle an Indian to participate in a war dance, he must have taken a scalp, killed his man or committee some act of bravery.</p>
                            <p>Last night when Little Head stepped out
                            
                            <pb n="149" xml:id="TMISB06-149"/>
                            
                            to tell his story and received permission to start the hot foot, he recounted some of the deeds that he had performed.  He said that he had whipped his mother-in-law, nearly choked the wind out of his father-in-law and had even assaulted his own father.</p>
                            <p>"What about killing your man?" asked some old brave who hung onto the ropes to keep from being crowded off his feet.</p>
                            <p>Little Head replied by acknowledging that he had never shed human blood.  He admitted that he had stolen any number of horses from the Winnebagoes and had had the smallpox and the measles.  Upon making the last remark an attempt was made to hoot him from the ring, but a delegation of Apaches, who are too religious to take an active part in the war dance, prevailed upon the master of ceremonies to let the man shake his foot.  After a good deal of thinking and some urging upon the part of the Indians, Little Head was allowed to go on and he danced so well that everybody felt glad that the concession had been granted in this particular instance.</p>
                            <p>There will be another Indian dance tonight, beginning about 7 o'clock.  It will continue until the Indians are exhausted or until the supply of pennies possessed by the audience is exhausted.</p>
                            <p>Saturday night the Indians will not dance, but instead they will participate in a sham battle that will be called promptly at 5 o'clock.</p>

                            <p>North Dakota will add to its exhibit in the Agriculture building by showing a fine line of vegetables raised in that state.  They will be here this month and will come in great abundance.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Lounsberry of North Dakota has written to Miss Ford, who is in charge of the exhibit, that he has arranged with the managers of about all of the county fairs in the state to send the best of their agricultural exhibits here to be shown.  He says that the vegetable crop is very fine this year, and that he will have no difficulty in securing an exhibit that will be as good as any in the building and better than many of them.  Touching upon other matters, Commissioner Lounsberry says that the attendance upon the exposition will be very large from North Dakota the last of this month and during the whole of October.  Crops have been excellent in that state, and farmers have plenty of money.  Many of them, he says, having read of the exposition, express a desire to see for themselves.</p>
                            <p>During the last few days some artistic changes have been made in the North Dakota section.  The dead walls have disappeared by having been covered with bunting and flags.  A number of new exhibits in the way of grain have been received and placed, until now the display is about as interesting as any in the Agriculture building.</p>

It was the intention to have appropriate exercises for the Galesburg people at the Illinois building and for the Shenandoah folks at the Iowa building.  But when they reached the grounds and the leaders of the parties conferred with the exposition officials the former decided that their respective contingents would prefer going through the buildings and grounds to listening to speeches and bursts of oratory.</p>
                            <p>For a time during the early morning the members of the two big excursions from Galesburg and Shenandoah kept together, but later in the day they separated and their bright badges were visible at about every place upon the grounds.</p>

                            <p>September 15 will be the birthday of President Diaz of Mexico and the members of the Mexican band have applied to the executive committee for permission to be relieved from their usual evening concert on that occasion in order that they may properly celebrate the occasion.  The committee has practically decided to meet the request by giving the members of the band a banquet on the grounds after the concert.  In this manner the wishes of the musicians would be carried out without depriving the patrons of the exposition of their usual concert and inasmuch as the band was secured merely for its transportation and expenses, it was suggested that it would be a very appropriate thing to help them to celebrate the birthday of their executive.</p>

                            <p>Douglas county is making a big addition to its exhibit in the Agricultural building.

                            <p>Heretofore the great difficulty in reference to the Douglas county exhibit has been the lack of <unclear reason="torn"/> any two of the states, with the exception of Nebraska, but still it has been cramped.  The reason has been that it has had such an endless variety of products to show, but now with the additional space it can spread out and make a still more creditable display.</p>

The precise days were not set, but each of the three battalions will drill in turn, and as the soldiers will be sent away very soon a drill will probably be given each afternoon.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;With tonight's work of the committee representing the Transmississippi Exposition invitations came to an end, Messrs. Cowin and Webster leaving for the west tomorrow.  In results the efforts of the committee cannot help but be far reaching.  Never was a committee of citizens so cordially received, and it is very much doubted if any committee sent to Washington for a definite purpose ever met with more flattering results than the delegation headed by Senator Thurston.</p>
                            <p>As it looks now the government of the United States will be transferred to Omaha during the week of October 10.  President McKinley stated to friends today that he was looking forward with much pleasure to his trip west and to show his appreciation of the invitations showered upon him has consented to stop at Chicago on his return from Omaha to join with the Chicagoans in their peace jubilee exercises October 19 and 20.  Omaha, he said, was first and he was glad to accept so warm an invitation as was accorded him on Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>Secretary of Agriculture Wilson returned from Iowa this morning and he had hardly got comfortably settled in his seat when Messrs. Webster and Cowin called upon him to extend him a like invitation as had been accorded other members of the cabinet.</p>
                            <p>"Your invitation, gentlemen," said Secretary Wilson, "is most thankfully accepted.  The president informed me this morning that I would be expected to accompany him to Omaha and I will be with you on October 12."</p>

                            <p>Of the exposition he had only the most glowing reports to impart to the committee and said the whole of Iowa was interested in the success of the enterprise, which in the face of almost insurmountable obstacles promised to be a financial winner.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner of Indian Affairs Jones also stated he would try to be present, as did Major Powell of the Department of Ethnology, and so it went.  Every department of the government will be represented as it looks now and it will require the most earnest effort of the management to take care of the crowds that will be present during Peace Jubilee Week.</p>
                            <p>While it was expected that courteous treatment would be accorded the committee on behalf the servants of the people of America, the treatment at the hands of the diplomatic corps, seen today, was even more captivating.  Minister Wu Ting Fung of China said to the committee, who were accompanied by Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn, that he would like very much to go to Omaha if business allowed and inquired closely as to the arrangements for the trip, time of leaving etc., indicating that he would leave nothing undone to make the trip with the president of the United States.  Minister Wu asked especially after the young women whom he met socially last winter and the winter before in Washington and when General informed him that they all joined in the invitation for him to come to Omaha he nodded his head pleasantly and said such an invitation was hard to resist.  The Turkish minister also said that if the situation permitted he would accompany the distinguished guests west, never having seen any portion of the country west of the Ohio river.  Nearly 200 invitations have been delivered by the committee personally since Tuesday morning and they leave tomorrow, feeling they can make a most satisfactory report to the Board of Directors.</p>

The Mexican, Omaha Concert and Second Nebraska regiment bands will take part, together with the Sons of Veterans drum corps, the exposition chorus and the male chorus, while the stereopticon will be utilized as heretofore to illustrate the different phases of the proceedings on canvas.  The pyrotechnical display will be the largest that has yet been given in connection with any of the concerts.</p>

                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/>Kiralfy's Grand Naval Spectacle, that closes at Madison Square garden on the 25th inst., will be put on at the exposition, a telegram having been received from Imre Kiralfy yesterday afternoon by President Wattles to that effect.  Mr. Kiralfy stated that he accepted the terms offered by the exposition, which are that the latter shall prepare the lake and seating capacity for a percentage.  The production will be put on at the lake on the north tract at the fireworks location, the lake to be considerably enlarged for the purpose.  It was first proposed to have it on the lagoon, but the parties could not agree on terms.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kiralfy stated that he had already placed the order for a lot of special scenery, and asked that President Wattles meet him in Chicago on Saturday to arrange certain advertising features.  This will not be necessary, however, as the exposition's representative is already in Chicago and has been instructed to secure 30,000 pieces of special illustrated advertising matter touching on both the Kiralfy spectacle and the peace jubilee.</p>
                            <p>The Naval Spectacle is to be put on from October 9 to the close of the exposition, October 31.  Mr. Kiralfy will endeavor to get ready to open a few days earlier than that if possible.</p>

                            <p>The same courtesies extended to the Second regiment on Wednesday were tendered yesterday to Lieutenant Dinsmore of company I and the fifty-seven soldiers of the guard and hospital corps who were left at the fort to take care of things while the regiment proper was enjoying its outing.  The detail was accompanied by the regimental band, but the men did not carry their accoutrements.  All had the freedom of the grounds, and were served a lunch at Markel's.  During the day the band gave three concerts, one being a serenade at the Administration building.  The organization received a number of flattering compliments, and it is stated that it is the intention to close a contract if possible for one week's engagement of the band at the exposition during the thirty days' furlough that begins next week.</p>
                            <p>George Pattee of Ackley, Ia., was in a peck of trouble yesterday.  He reported to the guards that he had been robbed of $25 in cash and $4,000 in notes.  From the statements made, Commandant Llewellyn advised him to go home and see if he had not left his wad there.  He did so and found that he had left it on the dresser.  He felt considerably relieved, but still showed traces of heart disease when he returned to announce his find.  He was more lucky than Henry Stockton, a Burlington &amp; Missouri fireman from Lincoln, who was on his wedding trip, and stopped to see the exposition, and was relieved of his pocketbook, containing $900, with which he had intended to furnish a home for his bride.</p>

                            <p>After 100 days, during which Nature lavished her merriest smiles, the 101st day of the exposition brought a combination of discomforts that threatens to detract materially from its success.  This is the first day since the exposition opened on which it has not been possible to enjoy the show without inconvenience, and it unfortunately occurs on the very occasion that had been anticipated as one of the big days of the enterprise.  Four big features combine to make it notable, but these are overwhelmed in a ceaseless drizzle of freezing rain drops that seep through an atmosphere that chills like November frosts.  But while the unfavorable weather undoubtedly kept thousands away from the grounds, there could be no more emphatic indication of the merit of the show than the fact that in spite of conditions that would apparently kill the attendance entirely, there are enough people on the grounds to make a respectable showing.  The buildings are all well occupied with visitors and processions of men and women in winter wraps and protected by umbrellas move up and down the avenues apparently oblivious of the chilling rain.  They came to Omaha to see the show and they evidently do not propose to let exterior discomforts interfere with their plans.</p>
                            <p>The dubious outlook was most discouraging to the people who have been working for weeks to provide the special attractions of the day.  Some of these were of more than ordinary interest and their projectors confidently expected to be rewarded by the approbation of upwards of 30,000 spectators.  But it is announced that the various events of the afternoon will be carried out as projected, and it is possible that some of them may be repeated when the conditions are more favorable.</p>
                            <p>The production of Imre Kiralfy's big spectacular show, illustrating the naval battles of the recent war, is now considered assured.  After the contract had been supposed to be closed Mr. Kiralfy wired that he would have to be given a $15,000 guarantee or else he would go back to Europe the next day.  He was promptly informed that the executive committee would not stand for any guarantee whatever, but he evidently reconsidered his European trip, for yesterday he wired President Wattles that he would come west at once to conclude arrangements.</p>
                            <p>The idea of having the special committee now in the east call on ex-Presidents Harrison and Cleveland to invite them to attend the Jubilee has been reconsidered, and President Wattles has been authorized to designate another committee for this particular purpose.  It is understood that Dr. George L. Miller will head this committee, and the remaining members will be appointed as soon as President Wattles can consult with Dr. Miller.  This committee will probably leave for the east early next week.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Red Men Will Engage with Each Other in Mimic Warfare.</head>
                            <p>The Indian sham battle that is to be fought tomorrow night promises to be a history making event in connection with the exposition.  It will be the first time that Indians have engaged in a mimic affray.  The battle will be fought as near 5 o'clock as possible and upon the forty acres of ground lying just west of the Apiary building and on which the Indians are encamped.</p>
                            <p>For days the Indians have been drilling and practicing for the fight that will occur tomorrow night and those who have the matter in charge feel that the redmen will cover themselves with glory.  The fight will be between the Sioux on one side and the allied forces on the other, about 300 engaging in the contest.  The Sioux will occupy the open field on the east side of the grounds and their opponents the wooded lot down where the majority of the tepees are located.  Nearly all of the Indians will be mounted and all will be armed with rifles.  They will have an abundant supply of blank cartridges, as Captain Mercer has secured from the arsenal at Rock Island, Ill., 300 rifles and 10,000 rounds of blank ammunition.</p>
                            <p>The plan of attack has practically been agreed upon.  The Sioux of the different bands will send out a scouting party, the members of which will return and report the enemy encamped in the woods and brush.  Immediately after this a dash will be made into the camp of the enemy, the purpose being to surprise the foe.  However, the surprise will not be complete, as the Indians in the <choice><sic>wods</sic><corr>woods</corr></choice> will be expecting something of the kind.  They will meet the Sioux and drive them back, capturing a number of men and ponies.  The men will be tortured at the stake, but before life becoming extinct they will be rescued by their friends, who with reinforcements will renew the attack.</p>
                            <p>In the second engagement it is arranged that the Sioux shall be victorious and in addition to perching a victory high upon their banners, they are to capture a few Indians who will be tied up by the thumbs, scalped and treated to about all the torture known to the Indians of the plains.</p>
                            <p>That the scalping act may be made more realistic, it has been practiced until the Indians have it down just about as fine as they did some forty or fifty years ago, when they were the monarchs of the country west of the Missouri river.</p>
                            <p>The grand finale and the scalping will take place in the open space in front of the office buildings on the Indian congress grounds and in full view of all who happen to be in that vicinity.</p>

                            <p>The 25 cent rate scored another success last night in spite of the fact that the chilly atmosphere had a tendency to minimize the audience at the Plaza concert.  A great many of the people who had been on the grounds during the day went home soon after sundown and this prevented the evening crowd from showing its full strength.  It appeared about the same as during the afternoon instead of largely exceeding it, as it would have done had it not been for the unusual volume of the early departures.  It was an exceptionally good night for the Midway attractions that had inside performances, but the gardens and other out-of-door resorts did not profit in the same proportion.</p>

                            <p>The increase of attendance at the exposition gives constant evidence of the efficacy of the work of the Department of Publicity.  With the prevailing war and high railroad rates throughout the three first months of the exposition the net result shown is indeed remarkable.  Since the close of the war the metropolitan dailies are devoting liberal space to the attractive features of the exposition.  The New York Tribune illustrated supplement of September 4 presents a full page of half-tone pictures made from official photographs.  The San Francisco Daily Call, August 28, devotes half a page to the exposition, with line drawing cuts made from official photographs.  The Buffalo Daily Courier is publishing half-tone pictures of the exposition from time to time.  The Wave of San Francisco, August 20, presents a whole page of half-tone pictures, with descriptive matter.  The Youth's Companion of recent date, with its immense circulation, presents nearly a page, in the center of which is a fine half-tone view of the Grand Court.  Remarques of New York devotes a page to a large half-tone cut of the medallion representing a composite picture of the forty-four beautiful American women

                            whose features adorn the medal commemorating the exposition.  August 27 the Scientific American gives up its first page to half-tone views of exposition architecture, and on another page a descriptive article of considerable length.  The Inland Printer, noted for the artistic reproduction of photographic views, in its last issue presents a descriptive article, with a group of photographs of the main buildings and Midway structures, and also three night scenes, showing the illumination of the Government building, the Fine Arts building and the electric fountain.  The Western Newspaper union is publishing news matter furnished by the Department of Publicity throughout all its lists in the states of the central west&#8212;about 2,600 weekly newspapers.  The American Press association is handling from day to day the news features of the exposition and serves the daily papers in the smaller towns of the west, as well as many weeklies.  The Des Moines, Kansas City, Denver, St. Paul and Salt Lake papers are showing great liberality, and nearly every community within 500 miles of Omaha is well aware of the importance of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

                            <p>The druggists of Nebraska, with a little assistance from those of adjoining states, made an excellent showing on the grounds yesterday, and their celebration was a fitting conclusion of the entertainment that they have enjoyed during their stay in the city.  The local committee had made every possible arrangement to insure a delightful holiday, and their guests were apparently thoroughly appreciative.</p>
                            <p>The first event on their program was a dinner at the cafe, at which fully 200 covers were laid.  The spread was thoroughly satisfactory and was followed by an elaborate program of toasts, over which N. A. Kuhn of this city presided.  Most of the speeches referred particularly to matters connected with the profession and they abounded in happy hits, personal and otherwise, that enlivened the occasion.  The following toasts were offered:  "Our President," E. J. Seykora, South Omaha; "No King's Domain <choice><sic>E're</sic><corr>E'er</corr></choice> Covered all the Earth," Charles M. Ford, Denver; "For Courage Mounteth with Occasion," Mrs. Belle C. Heilman, Sterling, Neb.; "Our Sister State," A. H. Miles, Des Moines; "Pharmacy Laws," H. R. Gering, Plattsmouth; "Our Friend the Wholesaler," C. F. Weller, Omaha; "On the Banks of the Wabash," D. J. Moran, Council Bluffs; "Our Impromptu Orator," James Reed, Nebraska City; "A Forty-Niner," H. H. Barth, Omaha; "Impromptu Address," A. A. Broadle, Waverly, Ia.</p>
                            <p>The sports on the Plaza occupied nearly the entire afternoon and included a variety of amusing events.  Some have become familiar as incidents of similar celebrations, but others were decidedly unique and interesting.  There was a big field of entries in each event and the program was run off without a hitch.  The very excellent system was adopted of having each event in charge of a particular set of judges and this saved a good deal of time and prevented the confusion that would probably have resulted if one set of judges had been required to pass on the entire program.  This is the list of events and winners as announced by the committee:</p>

                            <head type="sub">EIGHTEEN PUEBLO INDIANS ARRIVE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Representatives of a Most Interesting Race Join the Congress.</head>
                            <p>The numerical strength of the Indian congress was increased yesterday by the arrival of the eighteen Pueblo Indians from Espanola, N. M., who arrived on one of the early trains in charge of Pedro J. Baca, the interpreter.</p>
                            <p>The Pueblos are without doubt the most interesting Indians on the grounds and are rapidly becoming the drawing card.  They are not so large as the Sioux and other northern Indians, but they are much different in every respect.  Instead of having the swarthy features of the Indians of the north, they are more on the classic order, lighter in color, more sociable and anxious to learn the ways of the whites.  While they are Indians, they believe that they are the remnants of an almost extinct race that once inhabited this entire country and was highly civilized and educating in the arts and sciences.  With them they have brought large quantities of pottery, some of which they contend was made centuries ago.</p>
                            <p>Among the Pueblos who arrived yesterday are some noted men of the race.  There is Diego Navanjo, the governor of the nation; Pedro J. Baca, lieutenant governor; Jose de Jesus Haraijo and Doloses Haranjo, head men, who have both held down the gubernatorial chair, and Jose Guadalupe Haranjo, the sheriff.  These men comprise the executive and judicial departments, as well as the legislative.  The system of elections is simple, the <choice><sic>men men</sic><corr>men</corr></choice> who have passed the gubernatorial chair having the power to elect the governor, who in turn appoints the other officers.  The present governor is serving his second term of office.  The term is one year and all of the officers step down and out when the chief executive leaves his seat.  The head men, or those who have been governors are the advisers of the governor and assist him in making the laws that govern the tribe.</p>
                            <p>The present governor is a small man, bright and quick in speech and is a good conversationalist in Spanish.  He understands the English language, but cannot speak it.  While the laws of the tribe are sacred, they are not so much so as a cane that is regarded as a portion of the property that goes with the office.  This cane is an ebony stick with a large silver head, upon which is inscribed, "Lincoln, President of the United States, to Santa Clara, 1863."</p>
                            <p>The cane was a present from President Lincoln to Santa Clara, who at that time was the governor of the Pueblos.  By him it was handed down to his successor and has since been turned over by one governor to another.  It is priceless and is carefully guarded day and night and is seldom out of the custody of the man who is charged with its safe keeping.  When not being exhibited, it is kept in a buckskin sheath and is never out of sight of the custodian.</p>
                            <p>The Pueblos who are upon the Indian congress grounds are not the Cliff Dwellers, though they say that they are descendants of that race.  Centuries ago they left their abodes in the mountains and became tillers of the soil.  Those who are here are all farmers residing some fifty miles from Santa Fe, in one of the rich valleys, where they raise grain, fruits of all kinds and sheep and goats.  Like their forefathers before them, they irrigate the land and say that they have done so for years, contending that they were the original parties who hit upon the plan of turning streams from their beds and causing the water to flow over the fields.</p>
                            <p>The Pueblos have their own peculiar dances, but little of the war dances of the other tribes of Indians.  They have been at peace with the world for unknown ages, and have forgot the arts of war.  Like other Indians, however, they dress in fancy colors and are as partial to beads and red blankets as the Sioux.  For a few days they will live in the building intended for a jail, as they have no other place to stay, not having brought along their houses.  They would have brought them could they have done so.  Instead of living in tents, when at home, they inhabit houses built of sundried brick.  As soon as they get around to it, they will construct such a house on the Congress grounds.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon the Pueblos called on the other Indians and expressed much surprise at seeing so many different races.  Speaking in a different language, they were unable to carry on a conversation, except through interpreters, which made the visits very unsatisfactory, as the interpreting had to be run through so many dialects.</p>

                            <head type="sub">General Passenger Agent of the New York Central on the Fair.</head>
                            <p>George M. Daniels, general passenger agent of the New York Central railroad, is booming the exposition throughout his territory.  Since his return home from Omaha he has been numerously interviewed and has without exception highly praised the exposition.  In a recent interview with a reporter of the Buffalo News he said prosperity was evidenced on all sides and among all classes in the west and had this to say regarding the exposition:  "The Omaha exposition bids fair to be the most successful of any exhibition of this character held since the Centennial.  I was informed by one of the principal officers of the exposition that the debt is practically provided for now and that with the same proportion of attendance for the next two months as they have had thus far not only will all the debts be paid, but a handsome sum be realized.</p>
                            <p>"Omaha has been making great improvements in her streets and public buildings.  The old verses published  in the early days are no longer applicable and George Francis Train's prediction, made in the early 60s, that Omaha was destined to be one of the great cities of this continent, is no longer a dream, but a reality.</p>
                            <p>"The eastern lines will undoubtedly make very low rates to the exposition for the next two months; we anticipate a large travel from all portions of the state in New York.  One feature alone of the Transmississippi Exposition will be well worth a trip from any portion of this country to Omaha and back again, and that is the Indian exhibit.  There will be assembled in the Indian department of the exhibition over 500 Indians, representing more than thirty different tribes, each with his pony, and when mounted they will form the most interesting procession of native Americans that this generation or any succeeding generation will ever see.  It is probable that there will never again be such a collection of original American Indians assembled together.  Every night the different Indian dances are given with the characteristic costumes and customs that have been in vogue for generations.  Each tribe has a different dance and the Indians themselves are as greatly interested in these dances as are the spectators.  It is one of the weird features of the exposition and no one who takes a particle of interest in the aborigines of this country should fail to see it."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Colorado's Fruit.</head>
                            <p>The long-looked for Colorado fruit exhibit arrived yesterday morning, and during the day was installed in its place in the Horticulture building.  It is looked after by Mrs. Shute, who was instrumental in inducing the growers of Colorado to make a showing.  The exhibit includes apples, peaches, pears, plums and grapes of all kinds and varieties grown in the state.  Fifty cases have been put upon the tables, but nearly as many more will be required to make the exhibit complete.</p>
                            <p>The method of showing the Colorado fruit is greatly admired.  Instead of board tables, wire stands are used, thus allowing air to circulate all around the plates.  The decorations are neat and appropriate.  Silk banners are used to show the counties in which the fruit was raised and around the booth on the south side of the exhibit are hung a number of pictures, showing views of Colorado scenery.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Courtney of the Oregon Horticulture exhibit is in receipt of a large installment of evaporated fruit and vegetables from his state.  Evaporated fruit has been seen here before, but the vegetables are something new.  There are potatoes evaporated, a pound of which it is said will equal one bushel as a life sustaining article.  The same is true of the onions.  The food is now used by the miners and those going to Klondike.  It is contended that a man can carry a month's <choice><sic>suply</sic><corr>supply</corr></choice> of vegetables in his overcoat pocket.</p>

                            <p>Too much dancing in the cool night air and too many grapes sent Comes-a-Running to the hospital.  He was very fond of both and took both in too large quantities.  The old man is one of the most enthusiastic dancers in the Indian camp and he is one of the most ravenous fruit eaters in the whole country.  A basket of grapes at a single sitting was not a circumstance, but if Comes-a-Running passes through the hands <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Yesterday Comes-a-Running was taken with cramps and was carted away to the Emergency hospital. Drs. Campbell and Strader made an examination and pronounced it a case of appendicitis, saying that the Indian has his vermiform appendix full of grape seeds, sent there by staying in the dancing ring too long and then eating too many grapes.  They talked knife for a time and then concluded that they could chase grape seeds out with a laxative.  They tried the remedy and now Comes-a-Running is on the road to recovery.</p>

                            <p>"The American Curfew Ordinance" was under discussion at the Auditorium yesterday afternoon.  There was a fair attendance and a marked interest was taken in the proceedings.  The meeting was presided over by R. W. Richardson, who delivered the address of welcome to the exposition.  The address of welcome to the city was delivered by Major R. R. Randall, after which Colonel Hogeland took up the discussion of "The Curfew Ordinance," the provisions of which he defended.  He contended that in every city where its provisions have been enforced it has done much good, and has been instrumental in saving many boys and girls.  He urged that boys and girls will never become completely reformed until they are forced to come into the house at <unclear reason="cut"/> o'clock in winter and 9 o'clock in summer.</p>

                            <p>Charger, the head man of the Cheyenne Sioux tribe, who has been here for a number of weeks, has been called home by reason of sickness in his family.  He resides near Forest City, S. D., and is very wealthy, owning 500 head of cattle and 200 horses.  Before leaving he purchased a couple of new wagons, a mover and a double-seated family carriage, in addition to a handsome brown suit of clothes.  Instead of paying cash, he settled with certified checks, drawn on a bank in Pierre, S. D.  The old man is said to have a bank account of $5,000, besides having several thousand dollars loaned out to stock men on the Sioux reservation and secured on herds of cattle.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion has left a contract for a quantity of large posters which will be used to advertise the Peace Jubilee and the Kiralfy spectacular production.</p>
                            <p>The Second Regiment band came down from Fort Omaha yesterday afternoon and rendered a very enjoyable concert program at the Administration <choice><sic>Ach</sic><corr>Arch</corr></choice>.  Their performance drew a good crowd and each number was warmly applauded.</p>
                            <p>Oregon has made a large addition to its exhibit in the Agricultural building by putting in sixty cases of salmon and other canned fish.  The exhibit is arranged in the form of a pyramid and is shown in connection with the other products of the state.</p>
                            <p>The cornet band of the Genoa Indian school arrived last night and the boys at once went into camp on the Indian congress grounds.  In the band are some of the finest musicians in the state.  They are all Indians and are all students at the school.</p>
                            <p>C. B. Wells, one of the wealthy sugar and coffee producers of Hawaii, arrived in the city yesterday and will remain several days, the guest of John T.

                            <p>An accident has befallen the huge glass churn in the Dairy building and it is doubtful if it will be put in operation.  It is constructed of plate glass and in putting it together all of the glass for the sides was broken.  It was the intention to use this churn and make butter in full view of the visitors to the building.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion received a letter yesterday from the North Star Press association of Minnesota which stated that the members of the association would visit the exposition September 15.  As the organization comprises all the editors of the state outside of Minneapolis and St. Paul the party will be an extensive one.  It will travel in a special Pullman train and will probably spend two or three days on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Rev. A. R. Horne, D. D., editor of the National Educator of Allentown, Pa., and a member of the Pennsylvania commission, was a visitor at the grounds yesterday.  This is his first trip to Omaha in twenty-five years and he expressed amazement at the progress that had been achieved during the quarter of a century.  Rev. Horne will spend several days in the city and will then return to assist in working up an attendance for Pennsylvania day.  He says that the members of the commission expect that from 1,000 to 2,000 Pennsylvanians will come to the exposition to help celebrate their state day.</p>

                            <p>Among the features yesterday at the tournament of the firemen was a quick hitching exhibition from the ground by the Kansas City company.  The apparatus was hauled out into the middle of the track, where the horses were unhitched.  The harness was stationed before the hind wheels of the wagon.  At a word and without a gong signal, the horses jumped to their places under the harness, which had been lifted up by the firemen, the wagon dashed to a hydrant fifty yards away, 150 feet of hose was attached and water was turned on.  But twenty-three seconds elapsed between the time that the word was given to the horses and the instant that water issued from the nozzle.  This is claimed to be not only a world's record, but it is believed that it cannot be duplicated.  It is made possible only because of the great intelligence of the horses.  A simple word started the animals from their places and with almost human intelligence they bended their necks and slipped into the harness.  The team is said to be the crack firemen's trick team of the world.</p>
                            <p>Chief Wiedman of the Lincoln company is anxious to match his team against any Omaha company in a running race of any distance and for any amount of money.  He offered to make such a match on the grounds, but Chief Redell would not do it, as he insisted that it was not a proper place.  He offered, however, to run a team against Lincoln on the Nineteenth street boulevard for any distance, if the use of the street could be secured, for $1,000.  The match has not yet been made, although Chief Wiedman says he will put the money up.</p>

                            <p>The signal officers have with them two large balloons and twenty small signal balloons.  They are the ones that were used in the campaign leading up to the capture of Santiago, two engineers going up in each of the larger balloons for the purpose of making observations.</p>
                            <p>The signal officers also have with them two field gas generators and one stationary gas compressor, which were used for filling the balloons with compressed hydrogen gas.  Experiments of inflating the balloons with gas and sending them up will probably be made on the exposition grounds each day, except Sundays, from now until the close of the exposition.  The exhibit will be under the charge of Major Ward.  The men left Tampa, Fla., with the balloons on August 31.  They had been there, under General Coppinger with the Fourth army corps, since early in June.  It is expected that an entire company of the signal corps will be sent here shortly to take charge of the balloons.</p>

                            <p>With no special celebration to attract the people and the chilling rain to keep them away, the exposition was practically deserted this forenoon.  A few hundred enthusiastic visitors came anyway, but there were not enough of them to serve as an apology for a crowd and the big enclosure seemed almost empty.  As the weather showed no indications of improvement the features of the day were postponed until next week, and the day was allowed to remain a blank on the exposition calendar.</p>
                            <p>Captain Mercer had planned a big sham battle to be pulled off this afternoon, but the field on which the engagement was to be fought is slippery and slimy with accumulated slush and the event was called off in favor of a more promising opportunity.  The spectacular fantasie that was to have been the feature of the evening concert will also be postponed, as it is not believed that anyone will care to linger on the Plaza such weather as this to hear music that they can just as well enjoy at another time.</p>
                            <p>General Manager Clarkson returned this morning from Cincinnati, where he attended the national encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic.  He says that while the veterans enjoyed an excellent session, the fact that a large number of the members of the various posts had sons in the volunteer army who were just returning home detected in a considerable measure from the attendance.  Major Clarkson presented his invitation to the veterans to participate in the jubilee demonstration October 13, and it was received with considerable enthusiasm.  He urged the veterans present to carry the invitation back to their various posts and is confident that a large number of them will visit the exposition during jubilee week.</p>
                            <p>The only excursion that was scheduled for today is one from Norfolk, Neb., and intermediate points.  The rain prevented any large attendance on this account, but quite a number of people took advantage of the reduced rate and came in on the regular trains.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles has received a telegram from Governor Adams of Colorado, who expresses his regret at being unable to attend the exposition on Colorado day as follows:</p>
                            <p>DENVER, Sept. 9.&#8212;Hon. G. W. Wattles, President Transmississippi Exposition:  The state of Colorado is today represented at the exposition by 2,000 of its citizens.  I regret being unable to be present on this occasion, but bespeak for the visitors from this commonwealth a hearty welcome.  Colorado leads the states in its production of precious minerals and from its valleys there were returned last year an agricultural output valued at over $40,000,000.  Our melons, twenty carloads of which the people of the Arkansas valley present to you today, are the most luscious grown in all <unclear reason="torn"/>
                            
                            <pb n="153" xml:id="TMISB06-153"/>
                            
                            Our small fruits fresh from the orchards are in your Horticulture building awaiting inspection and comparison.  Our mineral display is pronounced by experts to be the most comprehensive and dignified of all and a credit to the great state of Colorado.  In the educational and liberal arts displays you will find abundant evidence of the progress of this portion of the western empire.  I hope to be able at a later day to visit the exposition.  In the meantime take good care of our people for they are "the salt of the earth."</p>
                            <ab>ALVA ADAMS, Governor.</ab>
                            <p>Governor Adams' message was supplemented by another from William Byers of Denver, who said:</p>
                            <p>The state of Colorado will send through the exposition gates this morning 2,000 of its best citizenship.  As president of the board of directors of the Festival of Mountain and Plain I beg to congratulate you on the gigantic enterprise which has attracted to your doors so many of our people.  The fourth annual Festival of Mountain and Plain will be held in Denver, October 4, 5 and 6 and we are extensively advertising it in the east.  We hope to have many visitors from Omaha on our annual holiday and we promise all who come a unique series of entertainments.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Wonderful Exhibition of Agility Given on the Lagoon Yesterday.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The members of the Nebraska Lumbermen's association and their guests furnished a large proportion of the entertainment on the grounds yesterday and in spite of adverse conditions their share in the festivities was a thorough success.  The log-rolling contest on the lagoon was one the most novel and amusing features that has been given on the grounds and the clever performances of the trained log-runners held an immense crowd for two hours.</p>
                            <p>The special meeting of the Nebraska association, which was to have occurred at the Minnesota building at 2 o'clock, was without results from a business standpoint, as it was found impossible to get any great number of the members together at the same time.  The occasion was improved to rehearse the various attractions of the day for the benefit of visiting lumbermen and then the members adjourned to the lagoon to witness the log-rolling.</p>
                            <p>The contest occurred on the Mirror and the wide circle of pavement was packed with people who had only a vague idea of the sort of entertainment that was contemplated.  They found six husky young athletes in tights and spiked shoes cavorting on a lot of shifting logs as easily as if they were on solid ground.  Each of the logs was about ten feet long and not so big but that the weight of two men would sink it nearly level with the water.  A black ring around the center of each log separated the two contestants when the real contests <choice><sic>begun</sic><corr>began</corr></choice> and set a limit beyond which neither could go in his efforts to overbalance his adversary.  The entries in the contest represented a number of the biggest lumber firms in the northwest and each had his partisans in the lumbermen in the crowd.  There was a purse of $250 to be divided into four moneys of $100, $75, $50 and $25, respectively, and this, with the lively rivalry between the firms represented, was sufficient to make the contest decidedly interesting.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">Marvelous Exhibition of Agility.</head>
                            <p>The manner in which the athletes handled themselves on their uncertain footing was a marvel to the uninitiated.  Two of the contestants went out at a time, and when they had propelled their log well out into the lagoon they threw away their pike poles and depended entirely on their feet to keep them on the right side of the log.  The object of each was to throw his opponent off his balance without losing his own.</p>
                            <p>They watched each other like a pair of expert wrestlers waiting for an opening.  Then one would give the log a twirl with his feet that would make it revolve so fast that an inch of water clung to its surface and the rollers would still manager to keep on the upper side.  Faster and faster the log would whirl under their combined impetus, first one way and then another, but their feet flew as fast as the log rolled under them and even though it went under and they splashed through several inches of water they maintained their balance apparently without an effort.  But eventually an unexpected twist would send one of the men headlong into the lagoon and he was picked up by the judges' boat, while his successful competitor continued on dress parade.  Then another pair were given a chance and after one of them had gone down the third set went on.  Then the three winners were matched one against the other and then there were ties to be rolled off and altogether it was over two hours before the judges were satisfied.  All this time the contestants had been out in the freezing atmosphere in their soaked tights and during the intervals when they were not at work they shivered and chattered until the judges declared themselves satisfied and awarded the prizes.  T. H. Fleming of Eau Claire, Wis., won the first prize, A. R. Stewart of Eau Claire second and Gus Miller of Winona, Minn., third.  A <unclear reason="torn"/> of Minneapolis tied for fourth and the last man was John Murray of Eau Claire.  During the contests Murray also gave a remarkable exhibition on the "baby" log, a stick about four feet long and eighteen inches thick, which he handled under his feet as an acrobat does the wooden ball in a circus.  He not only rolled it sideways, but endwise and several other ways, and apparently he could not throw himself off if he tried.  Altogether the contest was a wonderful exhibition of cleverness and the crowd cheered its appreciation at every opportunity.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Some Thousands of Members of the Order Take Part in the Affair.</head>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the rain, the Woodmen of the World turned out in large numbers and made their presence felt at the exposition yesterday.  Owing to the sloppy condition of the grounds there was no parade around the Grand Court, nor was there a band contest.  The exercises in the Auditorium were held and were attended by fully 2,000 people, who listened to the speeches and the music.</p>
                            <p>Promptly at 2 o'clock R. E. McKelvey, presiding officer, called the meeting to order and introduced Mayor Moores, who extended a welcome to the city, during the course of which he said:</p>
                            <p>The order of the Woodmen of the World stands for the great principles of charity and fraternity as must all popular institutions which are destined to have permanent existence.  In no part of the world are these great principles more generally practiced than in the great central west, and this accounts in a measure for the wonderful popularity of your order among the hospitable, charitable and friendly people of this region.  The Woodmen of the World is a western institution&#8212;the product of western thought, push and financial sagacity.  I regret that your order does not have a splendid building upon the grounds of the Transmississippi Exposition, where the world might see this truly western product of which we are all proud.  I trust that the same splendid success which has attended the growth of the Woodmen of the World since its inception will continue in even greater measure, and that its future will be marked by safe, conservative management, prompt payment of claims and that its membership may be united by the strongest bonds of friendship into one great family.</p>
                            <p>Your order is one of the great agencies which are striving to bring men to realize that the brotherhood of man is not a theory, but a reality.  I welcome you therefore as the harbingers of a broader humanity, a deeper charity and a higher brotherhood, and I wish for you a most prosperous future.  The sovereign camp of the Woodmen of the World is located here in Omaha and every member of your association should feel that he owns the city for that reason.  I have therefore prepared for you these golden keys of the city which I present to you.  If you see anything you want, just take it, for it is yours.</p>
                            <p>The keys were accepted by Chairman McKelvey, who assured the mayor that they would not be allowed to rust during the stay of the Woodmen in the city, after the male quartet of the order rendered a selection and C. C. Farmer of Mount Carroll, Ill., was introduced, it being necessary to place him upon the program at the last minute, owing to the absence of Sovereign Commander <unclear reason="faded"/>is ill.  Mr. Farmer is the chairman of the sovereign board of managers of the order.  His subject was "Woodcraft," and in discussing it he said that during the last few years fraternal insurances have been built up all over the country, insuring the lives of hundreds of thousands of men and women.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the order of the Woodmen of the World, he contended that it is one of the best of the fraternal societies.  Its policies are not contestable after one year, no member is suspended while sick, it builds a monument over every dead Woodman and pays the sum of $2,000 to the beneficiary of each member; it provides for caring for the sick, and looks after the interests of the widows and orphans.  In addition to this the funds are carefully guarded and the officers are bonded to carry out every promise made by the camps.</p>
                            <p>The band concert was abandoned, but the prize drill was pulled off according to program, two teams entering, the drill team of Alpha Camp, No. 1, and that from Columbus camp, No. 69, both of Omaha.  The first prize, $75, went to the Alpha boys, and the second, $50, to the boys of Columbus camp.</p>

                            <p>The State Horticultural society will hold its annual fruit exhibition in the Horticulture building at the exposition next week, beginning Tuesday and closing on Friday.  The last day will be Grape day, and a special effort will be made to have an extra lot of this fruit on exhibition at that time.  Premiums to the amount of $1,000 will be awarded, and it is expected that this fact will be an inducement to bring out an attractive display of Nebraska's product in the line of fruit.

                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday was one of the most remarkable days, in many respects, which the exposition has experienced since the gates were opened.  The weather was the most disagreeable in the whole category of mean days in the stock of the weather man, but the fact that September 9 had been designated as Woodman of the World day, Colorado day, Lumbermen's day, Rocky Ford melon day and Hoo-Hoo day was sufficient to swell the attendance to a point which surprised all those who had predicted that the rain and cold would keep everybody away and prevent the distribution of the thousands of watermelons and cantaloupes which had been shipped to the exposition by the melon growers of Rocky Ford, Colo.</p>
                            <p>It was a big day and people who had made preparations to visit the exposition did not allow the weather to interfere with their plans.  The tide set in toward the exposition at 8 o'clock in the morning and there was no cessation until nearly time for the gates to close at night, when the turnstiles showed an attendance of 17,541.  Those from points outside of Omaha were not provided with shelter against the rain, but that made no difference to them; they went "with the swim," just the same.</p>
                            <p>Nearly every visitor to the grounds wore some kind of a badge and it was impossible to tell which badge was the most numerous.  The big button of the lumbermen, the black cat of the Hoo-Hoos, the many colored badges of the Woodmen and the pink badges of the Colorado visitors seemed to be about evenly distributed.  Before evening all these badges <choice><sic>sunk</sic><corr>sank</corr></choice> into insignificance and the Rocky Ford melons took precedence as a mark of fraternity.  Every man, woman and child on the grounds carried either a watermelon or a cantaloupe and all social distinctions were buried in the interest of a common cause.</p>

                            <p>In addition to being a "day" for a number of different societies, yesterday was marked by the formal opening of the Colorado horticultural exhibit.  This exhibit was delayed in installation by an accident to Mrs. M. A. Shute, the horticultural <choice><sic>commisisoner</sic><corr>commissioner</corr></choice> of the Centennial state, but the promising manner in which the display has been inaugurated promises to atone for all delays in getting ready.  The display is especially interesting because the arrangement of the space, the use of pretty wire tables for the display of the fruit and the handsome pagoda in the background are all the ideas of Colorado's woman commissioner, and the effectiveness of the result tells its own story.  The display is a fine one and includes the many varieties of luscious fruit for which Colorado is famous.  It is especially strong in peaches, a number of different varieties being shown, some of them being of enormous size.</p>

                            <p>The lumbermen of Nebraska and surrounding states carried out to the letter the program they had arranged for Lumberman's day at the exposition and the stream of dealers in wood which commenced to flow toward Omaha Thursday afternoon continued until noon of yesterday.  No record was kept out of the exact number, but careful estimates of the visitors placed the number of arrivals at nearly 1,000.</p>
                            <p>There were delegations from Kansas City, Denver, Minneapolis and numerous points in Iowa and Nebraska.  Among these arrivals were several delegates to the national meeting of Hoo-Hoos at Cleveland, who had come to Omaha in preference to going to the eastern meeting.</p>
                            <p>The principal trade papers were well represented, eight newspaper men being with the party, as follows:  Leonard Bronson, J. E. Defebaugh and A. C. Cone of the Timberman, Chicago; W. B. Judson, Fred C. Gilman and John W. Barry of the Northwestern Lumberman, Chicago; J. C. Walker and C. H. Kittredge of the Mississippi Valley Lumberman, Minneapolis.</p>

                            <p>All the lumber yards in the city were closed at 9 o'clock and 9 minutes a. m., the mysterious hour of the ninth day of the ninth month when the cabalistic sign of the Concatenated Order of Hoo-Hoo is in the ascendant, and all of the occupants of these offices joined in the welcome to the visitors.  Reception committees met every incoming train and the visiting lumbermen were decorated with the official exposition lumberman's badge&#8212;a button as big as a saucer carrying a picture of the Nebraska building.  These buttons entitled the wearer to reduced rates at several of the principal attractions on the Midway, besides distinguishing the wearer from the common herd.</p>
                            <p>The C. N. Dietz Lumber company kept open house at the office of the Sheridan Coal company, in the Board of Trade building, this being the only headquarters down town.  Crowds of the visitors were coming and going here all the time, and each one was supplied by Mr. Gould Dietz with tickets to the Streets of <choice><sic>Calro</sic><corr>Cairo</corr></choice>, Mystic Maze, Chutes, Moorish Palace and Hagenback's.</p>
                            <p>About noon all of the lumbermen gravitated toward the exposition grounds and at 2 o'clock there was a general round-up at the Nebraska building.  The Nebraska Lumber Dealers' association was supposed to have a business meeting at this hour at the Nebraska building, but no sane man expected any business to be transacted, and there wasn't.  The building was crowded with lumbermen and an hour was spent in getting better acquainted.  All of the officers of the state association were present and they assisted in promoting the fraternal feeling, but made no suggestion regarding the transaction of business.</p>
                            <p>At 3 o'clock the majority of all the people on the grounds gathered about the west end of the lagoon to witness the log rolling contest which had been arranged through the efforts of the Omaha lumber dealers.</p>
                            <note type="handwritten">Now add Log Rolling on advance page</note>
                            <p><del>A log rolling contest is a game in the water, where two men stand on a log about ten feet in length and about fifteen inches in diameter and each tries to throw the other into the water by rolling the log.  There were six entries in this contest, all of the men being expert loggers brought from the lumber regions of the northern states especially for the occasion.  The agility displayed by these men was something wonderful.</del>  Standing on the log with nothing in their hands with which to keep their balance, each wearing shoes equipped with long spikes in the soles, the log was rolled with lightning speed, first one way and then the reverse, until one of the men was thrown into the water.  The men contested in couples, some of the contests lasting two or three minutes and other barely as many seconds.  The entire exhibition occupied over two hours, but the interest of the crowd never abated.</p>
                            <p>T. H. Fleming of Eau Claire, Wis., won first prize, $100 in cash; A. R. Stewart of Eau Claire, second, $75; Gus Miller of Winona, Minn., third, $50; A. Dugas of Little Falls, Minn., and L. Cyr of Minneapolis divided the fourth prize, each receiving $12.50.  The sixth man was John Murray of Eau Claire, who was defeated, but he showed his agility in handling logs by giving an exhibition on a block four feet in length.  He turned this log in every direction, rolling it over and over and turning it end for end in the in the water without falling off.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>At the meeting of the board of directors yesterday afternoon ex-Superintendent John D. Owens submitted a communication relative to charges that have been made since his connection with the department of transportation ceased.  He stated that a systematic course of <choice><sic>evercharging</sic><corr>overcharging</corr></choice> had been indulged in by the monopoly that has had charge of the freight business on the grounds, and that his efforts to secure relief for the exhibitors and concessionaires who were thus forced to pay tribute were responsible for the action of the president in seeking to force his resignation.  He asked for such action as would relieve him from the odium that had been cast upon him by indefinite insinuations on the part of certain exposition officials.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles stated that he had no interest in the matter, but he had asked the manager of the transportation department to look into certain statements that had been made, and that the latter had called for Owens' resignation after investigation.  He said that so far as he was concerned he would be glad to have the matter fully inquired into, as he was certain that his position would not suffer thereby.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton moved that the communication be filed, but on motion of Mr. Weller it was referred to the investigating committee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">REPORT OF PASSES.</head>
                            <p>The report of passes issued was submitted by the bureau of admissions, as requested at the last meeting.  It showed 1,598 series A passes, 242 series B or short term passes, 3,568 series C or press passes, and 3,792 photograph passes, a total of a little less than 10,000 passes outstanding.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater wanted to know why the pass inspector was not making any reports, and was informed by Mr. Lindsey that reports were being made every day or two.</p>
                            <p>In reply to an inquiry from Mr. Wharton, Mr. Lindsey stated that the reports indicated that no material frauds had been perpetrated against the exposition in that direction, that there had been practically no cases where passes had been used by others than those to whom they belonged, but that a few cases had been discovered where exhibitors or concessionaires had secure photograph passes for persons who were not now in their employ, and that these had been cancelled.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Kilpatrick of the committee of audit, investigation and revision reported that its powers had been curtailed to such an extent that there was little for it to do, and that it had dispensed with the services of its stenographer.  It asked that the report it had made in the Bernstein case be returned to it.  This was ordered done, and the report was filed.</p>
                            <p>The bond forms that had been prepared when it was thought that it would be necessary for the exposition to issue bonds some months ago were ordered destroyed, as the concern is practically out of debt now and there is no use for them.</p>

                            <p>Some discussion ensued over the rules to govern the financial operations so far as cashing its own vouchers on the grounds is concerned, but no change was decided on, the secretary explaining the present system to the apparent satisfaction of the board, with the exception of Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>It will be remembered that at a recent meeting of the board the secretary told Mr. Rosewater that he had always regarded the latter as a great man and had often told him so.  Mr. Rosewater then became disorderly because the secretary had not taken more people into his confidence in that respect, and finally got up on his hind legs and "hollered" because the secretary had not hired a hall and lectured to the multitude on the subject.  He had not entirely forgiven the secretary yesterday for his neglect to make the most of his opportunities, and he entered a protest against allowing the latter to receive money and pay it out without its going into the hands of the treasurer.  He wanted Treasurer Kountze to establish a sub-treasury on the grounds, but the latter said he would not do it on his own responsibility, although he had no objections to the exposition doing <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Yesterday's crowd consisted almost exclusively of people who came to Omaha for the express purpose of seeing the exposition.  No one expected to see any crowd on the grounds and the enthusiastic visitors who struggled along the sloppy avenues at the mercy of the incessant rain occasioned surprise.  The bulk of the special features that had been scheduled for the day were made impossible and were postponed for more favorable opportunities.  The prospect of clearing and warmer weather offers some promise of better patronage today, when the 25-cent admission will prevail, and the people who have been kept away by the conditions of the preceding two days will have an opportunity to come out and enjoy some compensation.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles announced that the Kiralfy spectacle for the last three weeks of October is positively off.  The news is received without regret by a number of exposition officials who contend that it is extremely doubtful whether the evenings at that season will be warm enough to make such an out of door entertainment profitable.</p>
                            <p>Evidences multiply that from now on the only limit of attendance will be the capacity of the railroads to haul the people.  A prominent railroad official who was on the grounds yesterday stated that the accommodation of exposition travelers was becoming a serious problem with the roads that come into Omaha.  He said that during a recent trip through Iowa he was satisfied that during the next six weeks it will be a difficult matter for his road to accommodate its patronage.  Every little country town has its excursions party organized to come to the exposition.  Those who have been here once want to come again, and their enthusiastic descriptions of the show have aroused their neighbors until it looks as though the entire population of the state would have to be carried to Omaha and back before November 1.  Similar reports are received from other roads, and when the clouds recede and Nebraska's incomparable Indian summer beams on the exposition, it is believed that the roads will be unable to carry the crowds.</p>
                            <p>General Manager Clarkson returned yesterday morning from Cincinnati, where he attended the national encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic.  He says that while the veterans enjoyed an excellent session, the fact that a large number of the members of the various posts had sons in the volunteer army who were just returning home detracted in a considerable measure from the attendance.  Major Clarkson presented his invitation to the veterans to participate in the jubilee demonstration October 13 and it was received with considerable enthusiasm.  He urged the veterans present to carry the invitation back to their various posts and is confident that a large number of them will visit the exposition during jubilee week.</p>
                            <p>The only excursion that was scheduled for yesterday was one from Norfolk, Neb., and intermediate points.  The rain prevented any large attendance on this account, but quite a number of people took advantage of the reduced rate and came in on the regular trains.</p>

                            <p>The small crowd of visitors that was sufficiently patriotic to remain on the grounds last evening almost entirely congregated in the Auditorium to hear the band concert and the battle fantasie with which it was concluded.  While it was manifestly impossible to put on the pyrotechnical finale, the remainder of the battle piece was even more enjoyable inside the building than in the open air.  The <choice><sic>streopticon</sic><corr>stereopticon</corr></choice> views were seen to be decidedly better advantage and the music was materially strengthened by the big pipe organ on which Mr. Kelly played the accompaniments for the exposition chorus.  The entertainment was applauded at every opportunity and there was a general demand for a repetition of the fantasie in the Auditorium some evening this week.</p>

                            <p>The Colorado fruit in the Horticulture building is completely installed and is proving to be one of the most attractive yet seen.  The splendid exhibit that is made is largely due to the efforts of Mrs. M. A. Shute, secretary of the state horticulture society.  After the legislature of the state failed to make an appropriation for an exhibit, Mrs. Shute took the matter up with the fruit growers of Colorado and as a result a number of the best counties in the state are represented.</p>
                            <p>Otero and Garfield counties have the largest exhibits and also the largest number of varieties of fruit, though there are several counties that are making a good showing.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the fruit exhibit, George B. Fravert of Glenwood Springs said:  "Our crop this year is the best in the history of the state and we wanted to get here earlier in the season, but there were so many things to contend with that we found it impossible.  Not that we are here, however, we intend to make up for lost time and put up the best exhibit possible.  We have the fruit to show and our growers will send it on so that there will be nothing stale or wilted on our tables.  We are right in the valley of the Grand river, which is conceded to be the finest fruit producing section in the world.  There are thousands of acres of land in fruit and thousands more just as good that are not improved.  During the last year J. B. Hurlbut of Parachute and A. J. Dickinson of Glenwood Springs have located hundreds of men upon fruit farms and if the good work goes on for five years every valley in that section of the state will be great fruit farms.  The beauty of the country is that in the valleys we do not have frost until late in October, thus allowing the most tender fruit to mature.  Of course we can't raise tropical fruits in Colorado, but we can raise the best that grows in any northern latitude<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

The first four days of the week aggregated almost exactly the same as the corresponding days of the previous week.  Monday showed a gain of nearly 2,000, which was offset by a slight falling off Tuesday.  Thursday was somewhat lighter than the preceding Thursday, as thousands of people were waiting for the next day which was generally anticipated as the big day of the week.  Then came the deluge and the consequent decrease in attendance.  The following is the total attendance of the week, as compared with that of the week before:</p>

Denver, in company with a crowd of other lumbermen, had spent the evening at various amusement records and about midnight stood with his friends at Sixteenth and Farnam streets preliminary to the breaking up of the party.  As a parting demonstration the crowd gave the Hoo-Hoo yell, which goes off in rather a rousing fashion.  The concatenation was sufficiently loud to arouse a policeman in the vicinity, who seized Denver as the first man within reach and conducted him to the station, where he was charged with making a loud and unusual note.  The other members of the crowd were equally implicated, if any offense had been committee, but the policeman seemed to confine his resentment to Denver alone.  When the triviality of the occurrence was explained to the night captain Denver was released on a small bond offered by himself.</p>

                            <head type="sub">A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.</head>
                            <p>Frank B. Hibbard, the well-known farmer living near Irvington, Neb., has undertaken a task that will commend him to all people.  Mr. Hibbard realizes that the exposition should be visited by every child in Douglas county and to bring this result about Mr. Hibbard purposes to do more than his part.  Mr. Hibbard will within a few days extend an invitation to every pupil in the several public schools of Union precinct to accompany him on a day yet to be named on a visit to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hibbard will ask the exposition management to give him a special rate for the admission of his little guests.  The number will probably be 200.  It is to be hoped that the exposition management will give to Mr. Hibbard's little party the same rate that is <choice><sic>accored</sic><corr>accorded</corr></choice> to other children on children's day.  It is important that every child in Douglas county shall see this great exposition, and there will be many who will miss the opportunity unless a number of public-spirited men shall follow the splendid example which Mr. Hibbard has set.  A better work than this could not be engaged in by a man who desires to accomplish practical good, and Mr. Hibbard is entitled to the thanks of all good citizens for his generous offer.  There are many other people in Douglas county who are better able than Frank. B. Hibbard to take a number of children to the exposition, and the World-Herald hopes that some of these men will profit by Mr. Hibbard's example.</p>
                            <p>In every precinct in Douglas county an organization might be effected, the purpose of which is to provide means by private contributions for sending the children of that precinct to the exposition.  There are also in the city of Omaha many hundreds of children who have not yet visited the exposition and who will not be able to see that magnificent display.  It will not do that these children should miss this opportunity.  Such an opportunity will never again be offered to them, and it will be the duty of those who have been inspired by the sights on the exposition grounds to see to it that every pupil of the public schools of Omaha and Douglas county shall have the opportunity of visiting the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The World-Herald suggests that the exposition management shall fix a rate for children of Douglas county, say 10 cents for parties of 100 or more.  If this shall be done the World-Herald will guarantee that immediate steps will be taken to see that every child in Omaha and Douglas county who has not seen the exposition will be given the opportunity.</p>
                            <p>This is an important matter, and the World-Herald hopes that the exposition management will promptly act upon the suggestion.</p>

                        </div2>

                            <head type="sub">WAR BALLOONS A LUXURY.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Question of Paying the Freight Which Rosewater Contracted.</head>
                            <p>The exposition officials were greatly pleased Saturday when they learned that the long expected war balloons had arrived and they saw visions of increased crowds which would be drawn to the exposition to see the balloons which had been in the thickest of the fight at Santiago and which had served to mark the line of advance of the American troops and give the Spanish artillerists the range of the troops, thus enabling them to land their shells where they would do the most execution.</p>
                            <p>The joy of the exposition officials was soon turned to sorrow, however, when the morning's mail was opened and a very imposing looking envelope was found to contain a bill of lading for the balloons with the notation,
                            
                            <pb n="156" xml:id="TMISB06-156"/>
                            
                            "Freight charges, $2,600."  This was a stunner and the officials looked again to see if there was not some mistake, but the more the bill of lading was examined the plainer it became that the exposition was held responsible for the freight charges.  About this time it was learned that another carload of material belonging to the balloon exhibit had been shipped to Omaha from Montauk Point and that the freight on this was also a charge against the exposition.</p>
                            <p>An investigation was at once instituted and it was learned that Manager Rosewater had pledged the exposition for these enormous freight bills when he was in Washington and undertook to secure the balloon exhibit for the exposition.  What made this discovery the more interesting was the statement of a government official to the effect that Major Ward of the war department had made all arrangements for the shipment of this material to Omaha at the expense of the government, but when Mr. Rosewater offered the plethoric purse of the exposition as a method of saving the government funds the officials at Washington were not averse to taking advantage of the opportunity.</p>
                            <p>The exposition officials are holding their breath pending the arrival of the bill of lading for the material en route from Montauk Point and are wondering if the little manager of the department of duplicity and commotion also pledged the exposition to provide board and lodging for the fifty men whom Captain Yancey expects to have on duty here the balance of the exposition to operate the balloons.</p>
                            <p>It is estimated that the expense to the exposition of the war balloons alone, without reference to other items, will amount to about $5,000.</p>

                            <p>The double celebration of South Dakota and the Sons of Veterans, which was on the exposition card today, is off and since the rain seems determined to be the feature of the show it is permitted to have its own way without useless competition.  Governor Lee of South Dakota is in the city, but at a conference with General Manager Clarkson this morning he decided that it was not advisable to try to carry out the scheduled program in the face of existing conditions.  Consequently South Dakota day was postponed to October 6 and Governor Lee believes that the change will result in bringing a decidedly bigger crowd of South Dakota people than could be secured at this time.  The Sons of Veterans had no formal celebration, but proposed merely to visit the show in a body and enjoy themselves like other visitors.  As enjoyment was out of the question on this occasion, they will have their holiday later in the week.</p>
                            <p>Though the sum remained invisible and the north wind made home and a comfortable seat by the fire agreeable, the exposition was patronized by a fairly good Sunday crowd.  During the afternoon there were at least as many people on the grounds <unclear reason="torn"/>parent on preceding Sundays, and the main buildings entertained a liberal quota of visitors.  The porous material of which the avenues are constructed is easily dried by the wind and scarcely a trace remained of the mud and water that made walking disagreeable the preceding day.  The atmosphere had lost the damp and clammy quality left by the rain and, although it was a trifle chilly in the evening, it was far from being an uncomfortable day for visitors.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">All from Out of Town.</head>
                            <p>It was apparent, however, that the attendance consisted almost exclusively of out of town people.  Even the reduced admission failed to draw the local public, which evidently preferred to wait for more inviting weather.  The unusual number of strangers on the ground indicated that there are several thousand people in Omaha who were so well pleased with the show that they were willing to stay over Sunday to complete its inspection.  Previously the bulk of exposition visitors have spent a week or less in the city, and almost without exception they get away before Sunday.  But yesterday there were hundreds of people on the grounds who had been there during the week and many of them will even remain through the greater part of this week so thoroughly are they captivated with the spectacle.</p>
                            <p>For those who were not disposed to spend their time in walking through the grounds, there was a practically continuous concert in the Auditorium all the afternoon and evening.  There were successive performances by the Mexican band, the Omaha Concert band and the Denver drum corps, and these furnished a variety of entertainment from soon after the gates opened until 9 o'clock in the evening.</p>
                            <p>Since the plan of putting on Kiralfy's big spectacle has failed to materialize, the management is considering plans for providing a satisfactory substitute.  It is proposed to provide a spectacular celebration of some sort for Jubilee week, but the precise details have not been decided on.  The matter will probably be brought up at the meeting of the executive committee this afternoon and the spectacular artist of the Due Fireworks company will come to Omaha in a few days to confer on the subject.  The plan previously suggested of reproducing the sinking of the Merrimac on the lagoon is regarded as feasible, and this may now be taken up.  The daylight celebrations during Jubilee week are well provided for, but the desire of the management is to occupy the evenings with some attraction of commensurate merit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">List of Special Attractions and Celebrations at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>This week's program comprehends a wide variety of attractions and these are so arranged that the features are very evenly distributed.  This will avoid the misfortune of last week when the big events were mainly mobilized on Friday and the storm came to raise havoc with all alike.  Each of the next six days will be marked by its share of feature and the arrangement is favorable to a steady boom in attendance right through the week.</p>
                            <p>Today has a double feature in the South Dakota celebration and the attendance of the Sons of Veterans.  The South Dakota exercises will be held in the auditorium at 11 o'clock and Governor Lee and staff and a large party of excursionists will participate.  The attendance of Sons of Veterans will not be what was expected, because so many members of that organization are in the volunteer army.  In some cases nearly an entire camp is enlisted in the service and as a consequence many plans that were formed early in the season have been abandoned.</p>
                            <p>Wisconsin day occurs Tuesday and as a very low rate has been secured from all points in that state it is expected that one of the biggest state parties of the month will be brought in.  The day will be celebrated by the usual exercises.</p>
                            <p>Utah day is off on account of the death of President Woodruff of the Mormon church and this will leave the Shriners the undisputed possessors of the show Wednesday.  They have arranged a big celebration, which includes exercises in the Auditorium in the forenoon and a spectacular parade and other novel features later in the day.</p>
                            <p>Thursday will be New England day, Telegraphers' day and Children's day.  The local societies of New Englanders will spend the day on the grounds and the children of Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs will be admitted at a reduced rate.</p>
                            <p>Governor Barnes and party of Oklahoma will be here Friday to celebrate their state day.  There will also be a free distribution of grapes, and the Washington Editorial association will be the guests of the management.</p>
                            <p>Saturday is billed as Railroad day and Port Arthur day, and as all the roads have made especially favorable rates for this occasion it will be one of the big days of the week.  Nearly all the western railroads will make a special effort to permit as many of their officials and employes as possible to attend the exposition on this occasion, and a big crowd of railroad men of every branch of the service is assured.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant S. J. Logan of the Naval department has returned from his vacation.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee has voted appropriations for fireworks on Wednesday and Friday evenings of this week.</p>
                            <p>Dr. W. F. Schlaar, who has been in charge of the marine hospital exhibit in the Government building, has left for Washington.  Major Ward of the War department is also in the east.</p>
                            <p>Thomas Fleming and A. R. Stewart, two of the log rollers who participated in the contest Friday, will give an exhibition of fancy and trick log rolling on the lagoon at 2 o'clock this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Captain Knapp, instructor of the cadets' drill corps at Iowa college, says the entire corps, comprising 300 cadets, will come to the exposition in a body on Iowa day, September 21.  They will assist in the exercises of the day and give an exhibition drill on the Plaza.</p>
                            <p>Utah day, which was to be celebrated Wednesday, has been postponed on account of a telegram received by President Wattles that the governor and other leading citizens would be unable to come at this time on account of the death of President Woodruff of the Mormon church.</p>
                            <p>Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn has notified the exposition management that a shipment will be made of nine bronze guns of historic value to add to the government exhibit in the Government building.  The guns are among those which were captured at the fall of Santiago.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock has been notified by Chairman Caldwell of the Western Passenger association that a rate of 80 per cent of the lowest standard one way regular fare will be made on Odd Fellows' day, September 17.  This will apply from all points from which the one way fare to Omaha does not exceed $6, and the minimum excursion rate will be $1.</p>
                            <p>The United States Sons of Veterans' drum corps of Denver, which assisted in the production of the battle piece in the Auditorium Saturday night, will remain on the grounds this week and give daily concerts.  The corps includes twenty-seven people, and it is said to be the best drum corps in the United States.</p>
                            <p>Governor Lee of South Dakota wires that he will be here with his staff and a party of prominent citizens to assist in the celebration of South Dakota day today.  The exercises of the day will be held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock and will be similar to those which have occurred on previous state days.</p>
                            <p>Assistant Postmaster General Perry S. Heath in writing to Manager Rosewater acknowledging receipt of a book of colored photographs of the exposition, says that among a number of volumes of similar works in connection with the World's Fair and other expositions that illustrating the Omaha exposition is the finest of the kind he has ever seen.</p>
                            <p>During his stay in Cincinnati General Manager Clarkson met a number of prominent people from Toledo, who assure him that their city will make a big showing at the exposition on Ohio day.  Their party will include the governor, mayor and various other prominent officials and over 250 passages have already been taken on the special train that will leave Toledo on the preceding day.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">THE MONETARY CONGRESS.</hi></head>
                            <p>The most distinguished body that has assembled in this city since the opening of the exposition is now in session to discuss the fundamental principles of monetary finance.  The ablest exponents of the conflicting theories of money functions will meet face to face and grapple with the problems presented by the battle of the standards.</p>
                            <p>The discussion is not, however, to be confined to arguments for and against gold and silver as money standards, but will take a wider range, so as to include currency issues of all kinds and our banking systems as well as the reforms proposed for their improvement.  While nothing new is likely to be brought out as regards the basic principles of money, which were thoroughly ventilated in the educational campaign of 1896, and no converts are likely to be made among the combatants, many phases will doubtless be presented to confirm or explode contending theories as tested by practical experience since wheat and silver parted company through the operation of the irresistible and eternal law of supply and demand.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that the monetary congress is not instituted for the purpose of awarding medals or prizes to the ablest debater or determining by a jury of awards which side is entitled to the championship belt, the substantial contribution of the congress to popular education on the science of money will come from the publicity given to the proceedings through the daily press, the magazines and other circulating mediums.  This will fulfill the object of its promoters, whose chief aim is the diffusion of intelligence on the money question among the masses of the American people.</p>

                            <p>Wisconsin day is far from being the success that the management of the exposition had anticipated.  They are somewhat disappointed on this account, as extraordinary efforts had been expended to provide the Wisconsin commission with every facility with which to work up a liberal representation.  The lowest railroad rate that has yet been provided for any long haul was secured for the occasion and there was every reason to expect that there would be several good-sized excursions from the Badger state.  But apparently nothing was done by the Wisconsin commission toward seconding the efforts of the exposition, and the result is a small crowd of about fifty people, most of whom are from Milwaukee.  Neither the governor nor any other state official is present, and on that account the celebration that had been scheduled for the day was abandoned.  Such Wisconsin visitors as were on the grounds were informally received at the Wisconsin building, where they were provided with badges and this was the only <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Chairman Koch of the Wisconsin commission explained the lack of interest on the score that his state is so far away that it is impossible to induce people to make such an expensive trip in any numbers.  Governor Scofield had been unable to come because he had just returned from a ten days' trip through the volunteer camps in the south and is too much fatigued to think of coming on to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the fluke of the Wisconsin contingent the grounds were fairly patronized.  The attendance did not amount to the proportions from which it was reduced by the four days' rain, but the first glimpse of sunshine brought the people back in constantly increasing numbers.</p>

                            <p>As tomorrow is the prospective big day of the week, there is an inducement to occasional visitors to hold back another day to be sure that the rain is really over, but the people who come to Omaha exclusively to see the show were once more in evidence and there were enough of them to indicate a very successful week if the weather conditions are favorable.  Tomorrow the Shriners will monopolize the grounds and the local committee has outlined a program of festivities that well occupy the entire day.  The nobles and their ladies will assemble in the Auditorium at 9:30 o'clock and the next hour will be occupied by an informal reception and the distribution of badges and programs.  At 10:30 the exercises of the day will occur.  These will consist of addresses of welcome by Noble Henry Hardy on behalf of Tangier and Sesostris temples, Noble Frank E. Moores on behalf of the city of Omaha and President G. W. Wattles on behalf of the exposition, with a response by Noble E. F. Allen, illustrious imperial potentate.  The remainder of the forenoon will be occupied by a band concert and from 2 to 4 o'clock the visitors will call at the various state buildings, where they will be tendered informal receptions.  At the latter hour they will attend a special exhibition of the United States Life Saving service under the direction of Captain Knowles, who is noble of Palestine temple of Providence, R. I.  At 5 o'clock Captain Mercer will entertain the visitors with a sham battle that will be sufficiently realistic to raise their hair and at 7:30 the nobles will parade, accompanied by the Indian congress and the Streets of All Nations.  The parade will be reviewed by the executive committee and other notables from the balcony of the Mines and Mining building and the balance of the evening will be spent on the Midway.  At 9 o'clock there will be an especially brilliant display of fireworks, followed by the battle of confetti in the Streets of All Nations.</p>

                            <p>Preparations for the great Peace Jubilee in October are progressing with a celerity that is highly encouraging to the management.  There has not been the slightest hitch in any of the plans so far, and the enterprise is taking shape with a rapidity that is remarkable when the mammoth proportions of the event are considered.  In the meantime the arrangements are being pushed with the greatest energy and new ideas in the way of entertainment are continually developed.</p>
                            <p>The acceptances of prominent officials of the invitations that have been tendered them are already beginning to arrive.  The first high army officer to declare his intention to participate in the jubilee is General Joe Wheeler, one of the most conspicuous figures in the recent unpleasantness.  President Wattles received a letter from General Wheeler yesterday in which he gracefully expresses his appreciation of the invitation and says he will come to the exposition if he can possibly arrange it.  Secretary Gage and the minister to the United States from Venezuela have also forwarded their acceptances and others will now come in on every mail.</p>
                            <p>Dr. George L. Miller and John C. Wharton left for the east yesterday to complete the work that was so successfully begun by the other committee.  They will first stop at Chicago, where they will see General Black and endeavor to secure his promise to come.  Then they will see Melville Fuller, Carter Harrison and other Cook county notables and urge them to be present during the Jubilee.</p>
                            <p>From Chicago they will go to Indianapolis to request Former President Benjamin Harrison to be the guest of the exposition on the big occasion.  Their next stop will be in New York City, where they will be joined by Hon. J. Sterling Morton, and the trio will proceed to Princeton to urge a similar invitation on Former President Grover Cleveland.  They will also visit Camp Wikoff and extend personal invitations to the army officers there.  They will also call on Chauncey M. Depew and other big railroad guests to arrange for the special presidential train which will bring President McKinley and his cabinet to Omaha.  It is also proposed to have a special car attached to the train for the exclusive use of the Washington correspondents of the leading newspapers who may wish to accompany the party.</p>
                            <p>The order by which the Twenty-second infantry is ordered home to Fort Crook is another favorable point for the Jubilee.  It is proposed to have the army and navy as fully represented as possible and the gallant Twenty-second, fresh from the field of Santiago, will be a valuable addition to the number.  As the Second Nebraska regiment will be back at Fort Omaha by that time to be mustered out, both the regular and volunteer service will be represented.</p>

                            <head type="sub">President Graham is Backed Up by Vice President Wright.</head>
                            <p>In pursuance to the call issued yesterday by President A. C. Graham of the Council Bluffs Exposition association there will be a meeting this evening at 7.30 o'clock at the Grand hotel of the members of the association and citizens in general to make arrangements to take part in the parade and exercises on Iowa day, Wednesday, September 21, at the exposition.  The call bears the signatures also of George F. Wright, exposition vice president for Iowa, and Lucius Wells, resident director of the exposition.  Although the meeting has been called under the auspices of the exposition association, a general invitation is extended to everybody to be present and take part in the proceedings.  Both Mr. Wright and Mr. Wells are particularly anxious that the meeting should be a representative one and urge that the business men of the city be present.  The Iowa Exposition commissioners have advices that large delegations from almost every city and town in the state will be at the exposition on Iowa day and the men who have called the meeting feel that Council Bluffs, being the next-door neighbor to the exposition city, should send a crowd over on that day that would be a credit to the city and Pottawattamie county.  To get the matter well under way will require considerable work and for this purpose a number of committees will be appointed at the meeting tonight.</p>
                            <p>The effort made to secure reduced railroad rates for Iowa day has been successful and the local agents of the Iowa roads have been notified that round trip tickets from any part in the state will be sold at 80 per cent of the regular standard one-way rate, the minimum selling rate to be $1.  Tickets at this rate will be placed on sale Tuesday, September 20, and Wednesday, September 21, and will be good for return until and including Saturday, September 24.</p>

                            <p>George Stevens, register clerk at the Nebraska building, has taken a ten days' vacation, which he will spend at his home in Albion.</p>
                            <p>Mr. and Mrs. E. B. Bradin of Helena, Mont., are at the state building, the guest of President Sutherlin.  Mr. Bradin is superintendent of the mint at Helena.</p>
                            <p>The temperature in the Nebraska state building was raised yesterday by the commission putting up six stoves and starting fires in all of them.  It was one of the places on the grounds where it was comfortable.</p>
                            <p>The sham battle that was to have occurred Saturday night is now scheduled for Wednesday.  This is Shriners' day and as a number of attractive features have been provided it promises to be the big day of the week.</p>
                            <p>It was another bad day for the Indians and few of them stirred outside of their tepees.  Even the shows on the Midway had no attractions for them, as they preferred to sit around their fires to venturing out in the mud and rain.</p>
                            <p>The Oklahoma Press association, with about fifty members, will arrive in Omaha to attend the exposition on Wednesday morning, and the Washington State Press association, with about the same number, will reach the city Friday for a period at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A coterie of St. Louis local freight agents arrived at Omaha yesterday by special Pullman sleeper over the Missouri Pacific railroad.  They are exposition visitors and will be the guests of Omaha local freight agents during their stay of two days in the city.  Those who compose the party are:  W. Adams, T. S. Esterbrook, J. S. Lane, W. L. Lee, J. M. Allison, C. J. Suell, J. G. Crexling, A. Hamilton, A. L. Pollard.</p>
                            <p>The people who have been kept away from the Indian encampment on account of the unsatisfactory means of reaching it will be satisfied as soon as it stops raining.  Martin Dodge is on the grounds to construct a patent "steel covered" roadway thirty feet wide which will afford a more satisfactory means of access.  Some improvements will also be made in the lighting facilities and visitors will be able to see the Indians under decidedly more satisfactory circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Kelly of the Music department is corresponding with Evan Stephens, director of the famous Mormon church choir of Salt Lake City, with a view to securing this magnificent organization during Jubilee week.

                            <head type="sub">MacRae, Chairman of the Committee, Puts Off Action for Some Reason.</head>
                            <head type="sub">LOCAL LINES ARE GETTING ANXIOUS</head>
                            <head type="sub">St. Paul Man Has the Matter in Hand and Appears to Be Indifferent as to Whether Anything is Done or Not.</head>
                            <p>Although the Peace Jubilee at the Transmississippi Exposition is less than a month distant, the railroads have made no special rates for the occasion.  The passenger men of the Omaha terminal lines say that they expect very low rates&#8212;the lowest that have been granted for the exposition&#8212;will be put into effect by all lines for this occasion, but they do not know when the rates will be named.</p>
                            <p>The responsibility for the retardative policy on the Peace Jubilee rates appear to lie with George H. MacRae, assistant general passenger agent of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha railroad, at St. Paul.  He is the chairman of a committee of three assistant general passenger agents who were appointed at a meeting of all western lines, held in Chicago nearly two weeks ago, to consider the matter of special rates to Omaha during the Peace Jubilee.  This committee was instructed to recommend a line of rates for the occasion, and was to report back to the other lines as early as possible.  Although the committee was appointed on September 2, nothing has yet been heard from it.  No meeting of the committee has been held, and it is not known when a meeting will be called.  The other members of the committee are:  A. F. Merrill, assistant general ticket agent of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul, and A. B. Smith, assistant general passenger and ticket agent of the B. &amp; M. road.</p>

                            <p>So far as the railroads are concerned, Wisconsin day was like the weather, a little bit frosty.  About fifty people came in from the Badger state to attend the celebration of their special day at the exposition.  Some of these came down on the Omaha road from St. Paul, and the remaining delegates came over the Chicago-Omaha lines.  No great crowd was anticipated, as the railroads positively refused to put in the rate of 1 cent per mile asked for.  The Omaha passenger men favored the 1 cent a mile rate, but they could not get the other lines to agree to the proposition.</p>
                            <p>The general passenger agent of one Omaha line says: "I think Wisconsin should have had a rate of 1 cent a mile for its day at the exposition.  It would have been a real benefit to Nebraska.  There are a great many good Germans up in that state who could be induced to settle on Nebraska farms if they only once get a glimpse at our state.  I was in hopes a 1 cent rate would prevail, and if a large crowd had come we would have undertaken to move a great many of them out on our line through the state."</p>

                            <head type="main">ART AT THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <p>Tolstoi has written a new book on the subject of art, in which he upholds the idea that true art should, and does, appeal to the masses.  It will certainly be an interesting book to read, for Tolstoi's point of view is always interesting even when one does not agree with him.  But if he advances the theory that the appreciation of a good picture is the inheritance of all people&#8212;then the recognition of a poor picture must be quite as natural.  If that is the case "why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things" about the picture on the Midway inaptly called "Trilby?"  One is obliged to reply to that in the words of the prophet of old, "they have eyes but they see not," and not even the music of the spheres could touch the ear of a deaf man, and for the blind, the beauty of the Sistine Madonna would be no more than ugliness.</p>
                            <p>Very few people have any exact knowledge of form, but only casual and vague impressions.  For if they "see" with understanding, they would know that when the weight of the body rests on one foot that foot spreads out and appears to be bearing a burden.  Look at Trilby's feet, they are poorly drawn, much too small and seem to be dragging in air rather than upholding 138 pounds.  She rests, or is supposed to rest, on her right foot, therefore the right hip should be higher than the left one; it can't be otherwise in life unless her left leg was several inches longer than the right one, which must have been the case with this model as her two hips are opposite one another&#8212;and yet the oracle tells us that all artists and doctors agree that it is the most wonderful anatomical picture ever painted!  I think a surgeon would say she ought to be sent to the hospital and I am sure an artist would.  Not that one expects perfection of drawing, only no deformities.  The oracle tells us also, with the same enthusiasm and tone of voice with which he formerly recited the multiplication tables, that her measurements agree in every <choice><sic>paticular</sic><corr>particular</corr></choice> with the Venus de Milo!  Look at that nineteenth century waist and at the short, coarse, thick neck and then recall the beautiful lines and perfect proportions of the Venus de Milo!</p>
                            <p>The face is painted according to the colored calendar type of beauty: eyes much too large, mouth too red, nose very straight and not quite in drawing&#8212;in fact, the face is banal and lacks all charms of nature and all beauty of truth of character.  And yet one hears on every side the discriminating adjectives of "grand" and "fine" and "perfectly lovely" applied to it.  What idea or thought, or fancy or emotion does she express?  If the conception were great we would excuse the poor expression&#8212;the drawing, the modeling, the coloring&#8212;but the idea is so deadly commonplace that it needs some technical skill to give it reason for being, and that one seeks for in vain.  The color is raw and unrefined.  A photograph colored by receipt would be quite as interesting and have the advantage of being in drawing.</p>
                            <p>Mr. William M. Hunt said:  "I might have painted had I lived in an atmosphere of art, but in America everything resolves itself into the getting of money and selling a poor article instead of a good one."  This is verified in the case of Trilby, if it is true that the painter&#8212;Mr. Astley Cooper&#8212;received $25,000 for it.  Who is Mr. Astley Cooper?  He is not heard of at any of the exhibitions, he is unknown to artists, and yet we are informed that he has accomplished what artists have striven in vain for centuries to accomplish, and the people believe this oracle.  One cannot but think of the nude figures of giant draughtsmen like Bourgereau, Gerome and Colin and sigh at the credulity of mankind.</p>
                            <p>I feel as if I should apologize for writing at such length of a picture which merits so little consideration, but I have heard it spoken of as quite a masterpiece, and it really does not belong in the higher walks of art at all.  If those who like it will go again and study it carefully and then look at the fresh painting in the Fall of Babylon or even in the dainty little nude&#8212;No. 86&#8212;in the Art building, they will be conscious of the difference.  The main attraction about the picture is the classic entrance to the building in which it is placed, the clever way in which it is lighted and staged, and the fact that your attention is called to all the details, the roses, the cupids and the miniature on the jardiniere, each drooping leaf of the palm and the worn out velvet of the dais.  (Poor Trilby in Paris, she never had a chance to pose on a carved model stand like this one, adorned with mother of pearl!)  This imitative, ignoble style of painting belongs in the same category as the "Bachelor's Drawer"&#8212;No. 263.</p>
                            <p>Poor Du Maurier!</p>
                            <p>Henry James said he never fully recovered from the effects of the crushing notoriety given him by the appreciative American public.  Trilby hats, Trilby ties, Trilby dramatized, was more than he could endure.  But had he been able to pull through the tidal wave of popularity, I am sure this would have been his death blow!  He who loved gentle satire and humor and art in its highest meaning, who not only created Trilby from the recollections of his Paris student days, but with his own pen gave us his ideal of the frank and fearless grisette, would indeed receive a blow if he could see this interpretation of his lovable, well formed Trilby.</p>
                            <p>There is a little picture in the southeast room of the Art building which has all the qualities that Trilby has not; each time you look at it you like it better and better; it appeals to you strangely, and finally you wish that you owned it.  It is by an American&#8212;Mr. Sergeant Kendall, who was a pupil of Benjamin Constant.  The subject&#8212;"Saint Yves, Pray for Us"&#8212;is simplicity itself; two Breton girls, one a child, the other on the threshold of womanhood, are sitting on a stone seat at the foot of a white washed wall, to which a small image of the saint is attached.  The young girl shrinks to the side of the elder&#8212;perhaps her sister&#8212;who looks up to the shrine with pathetic and innocent faith.  There are no other accessories to distract the attention; you are alone with the two country girls and are conscious of your closeness to them and their emotion.  There is a delicate truth of painting, a purity of color which vibrates, and a sincerity in the painter's work which arouses one's sympathies.  Here there is no trick of lighting, or of imitation; it has higher qualities&#8212;the quality of truth seen and translated by a painter who has a keen vision and feels the sentiment of poetry, who was in sympathy with his subject and who knew how to express himself in the <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">Western Welcome Given the Highest Servant of the People--Secretary Wilson and Postmaster General Smith.</head>
                            <p>The acceptance by President McKinley of the invitation to visit Omaha during the Peace jubilee will bring to this city a large party of distinguished people, including the members of the president's official family, ministers of foreign countries with their suites and prominent government officials.</p>
                            <p>This assurance was brought to Omaha by the members of the special committee which made the journey to Washington for the express purpose of extending an official invitation to the president and the members of his cabinet.  The committee as originally appointed included Senator J. M. Thurston as chairman, Senator W. V. Allen, Congressman D. H. Mercer, General J. C. Cowin, John L. Webster and John C. Wharton.  Messrs. Mercer and Wharton were unable to go to Washington and when the committee visited the White house it was accompanied by Colonel E. C. Snyder, secretary to Senator Thurston, and W. J. Broatch.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen, General Cowin and Mr. Webster returned to Omaha last week and Colonel Snyder arrived yesterday.  The members of the committee were greatly pleased with the reception accorded them by the president.  He expressed his appreciation of the importance to the west of the occasion and said he was especially desirous that no political color be given his visit.  Of the fourteen invitations from as many governors of Trans-Mississippi states, inviting him to honor the exposition and the jubilee with his presence, the president opened and read only one&#8212;that of Governor Holcomb&#8212;and when he read the hearty wish of the people of the west that he should come to Omaha, coupled with the manly invitation of Nebraska's governor asking him to come and assuring him that the people, regardless of the political beliefs, would be glad to welcome him, the president said he would come.  Arrangements were made then and there by which a special train will convey the president and his party to Omaha, arriving here about midnight of October 11, thus giving the president an opportunity for rest before beginning the arduous work before him.</p>
                            <p>The members of the committee left Washington at once for the west, but Colonel Snyder remained behind until Friday and received assurances from a number of high government officials that they will be in the presidential party.  Secretaries Gage, Smith, Wilson, Bliss and Griggs will accompany the president in obedience to his expressed wish that they should do so, and Secretary Alger will join the party in Chicago en route west if his duties in connection with the inspection of the hospital camps will allow him to do so.</p>
                            <p>Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith will be in Omaha, October 5, Pennsylvania day, when he will be the orator of the occasion.  The following day, October 6, he will make a political speech at Topeka, Kas., and on October 7 he will speak at Wichita.  The time intervening between then and October 12 will be spent in this vicinity.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wilson reached Washington Thursday of last week after a trip to Iowa, but told Colonel Snyder he would accompany the president to Omaha, as the chief executive had made it known to him that such was his desire.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese minister, Yang Yu, will also be in the party, accompanied by his suite, which includes twelve or fifteen persons.</p>
                            <p>The Turkish minister, Effendi Bey, will be another of the foreign representatives who will attend with a numerous suite all dressed in the rich and gorgeous costumes which distinguish the oriental representatives.</p>
                            <p>The minister of Austria-Hungary, Landislaus Hengelmueller, had intended to be of the party, but the recent assassination of the empress has thrown the entire court into mourning and court <choice><sic>etiquet</sic><corr>etiqutte</corr></choice> will prevent the minister from being present on the festal occasion.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Snyder says all of the members of the board of control of the Government building will be in Omaha during the Peace jubilee, also Assistant Secretary Cradler of the state department, Hon. Charles G. Dawes, comptroller of the currency, Commissioner Jones of the Indian bureau, Director Powell of the ethnological bureau, and many other officials of prominence.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee yesterday approved a design for the diplomas which are to be given to exhibitors who are awarded prizes in the various competitions.  The design is an attractive one, showing a view of the main court as the center of the picture, with the shields of the Trans-Mississippi states arranged above in the form of a semi-circle.  Below appears the blank space for the name of the exhibitor, class, etc., and to the left of this is a figure representing peace.  At the top are three groups representing mining, agriculture and industry, and below these appears the legend:  "Peace hath her victories as well as war."  The secretary was instructed to advertise for bids for lithographing these diplomas.</p>
                            <p>A form of medal to accompany the diplomas was also approved.  The medals will be of bronze, about two and one-half inches in diameter, with the official seal of the exposition on one side and a laurel wreath on the reverse.  Bids will also be asked for supplying these.</p>

                            <p>Wednesday of this week is Shriners' day and preparations are being made to make it an occasion which shall stand out in the category of exposition days in the most prominent manner.</p>
                            <p>The program for the day will commence at 9:30 o'clock, when the Shriners will rendezvous at the Auditorium.  At 10:30 a. m. exercises will be held in the Auditorium, the festivities beginning with an address of welcome to visiting nobles by Henry Hardy, illustrious potentate of Tangier temple.  Mayor F. E. Moores and President G. W. Wattles will follow in welcoming the visitors to the city and to the exposition, after which Noble Ethelbert F. Allen of Kansas City, illustrious imperial potentate of North America, will respond on behalf of all the visiting nobles.</p>
                            <p>From 2 until 4 p. m. the nobles will put in their time visiting the state buildings on the bluff tract, and at 5 o'clock a sham battle will be fought on the Indian congress grounds for their especial delectation.</p>
                            <p>At 8 p. m. there will be a big parade, participated in by the Shriners, the people and camels from the Streets of All Nations and the Indians from the Indian congress grounds.  The parade will start from the Streets of All Nations and will proceed south on Twentieth street to the main court and thence west to the Government building and east along the south side of the lagoon.  The parade will be reviewed at the Mines and Mining building by the president and members of the executive committee of the exposition, and will proceed over the viaduct to the bluff tract and thence through the Midway to the fireworks grounds, where there will be a gorgeous display, including portraits of the illustrious potentates of Sesostris temple of Lincoln and Tangier temple of Omaha, the well known insignia of the order and other devices.</p>
                            <p>After the fireworks there will be a battle of confetti in the Streets of All Nations, and the nobles will then overrun the entire Midway for the remainder of the night.</p>

                            <p>Martin Dodge, chief of the good roads bureau of the agricultural department, has arrived at the exposition, and will begin the construction of a road to illustrate the practical work of this bureau.  This road will be constructed along the north side of the Apiary building and will extend from Twentieth street to the Indian congress grounds.  It will be what is known as a steel road, using small steel chips as the surface material.  It is said to make an excellent road and to be very durable.</p>
                            <p>A delegation of fourteen local freight agents of the terminal lines at St. Louis and East St. Louis are at the exposition as the guests of the Missouri Pacific company.  The party arrived yesterday in a special car, which was sidetracked on the north side of the exposition grounds, and the entire day was spent in going through the exhibit buildings under the guidance of Manager Babcock of the transportation department.  They will remain in the city today and will leave tonight for their homes.</p>

                            <p>Rehearsals have occupied the time of the Indian Village for two days, and this afternoon at 5 o'clock the result will be a big sham battle between the six tribes of Sioux, as pitted against the Assinaboines, Apaches, Flatheads, Blackfeet, Cheyennes, Foxes, Poncas, Tankewas, Pueblos, Omahas and Winnebagoes.  Over 400 braves will participate all mounted and armed with Springfield carbines, with plenty of blank cartridges.  Supper immediately followed the fight, and then a big war dance.</p>
                            <p>Today 125 Indians from Fort Sill and the southwest, with 100 ponies, are expected to arrive.  In the party is to be no less a distinguished personage than Chief Geronimo, who, with his band of Apaches, spread terror through Arizona for years, and required General Miles and half of the army to eventually capture.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Report for Duty With the War Balloon to Be Exhibited.</head>
                            <p>A detachment of nine men of the volunteer signal corps, under command of First Class Sergeant F. E. Barton, arrived in the city yesterday under orders to report to Captain Yancey of the volunteer signal corps for duty with the war balloons recently sent from Tampa to Omaha for exhibition at the exposition.  The men in the party are Sergeants H. E. Courtright, F. A. McIntosh, J. A. Miner and William Lockhart, Corporals Peter Venderwerf and Fred Shaver and Privates Guy Lewis and William Liebenrood.</p>
                            <p>These men have all been on duty at Tampa since the beginning of the war, but have seen no actual service except that of camp life.  They are expert signal men and telegraphers.  With the three men who arrived with the balloons last week there are now twelve men of the volunteer signal corps in the city, among the number being two machinists and one aeronaut.</p>
                            <p>No arrangements have yet been made for installing the gas making plant required for the operation of the balloons, but the indications are that the whole arrangement will be located on the bluff tract, south of the Horticultural building.  Among the equipment received from Tampa are 169 tubes containing compressed hydrogen gas for inflating the balloons.  These tubes were filled in Tampa for the purpose of sending them to Cuba, but the necessity for their use passed before the work was completed.  These tubes are available for inflating the balloons on the exposition grounds during the installation of the gas making plant.</p>
                            <p>The fifteen men who are en route to the exposition from Montauk Point with a lot of signal equipment are all regulars, and many, if not all, of them were on duty at Santiago as signalmen.  They are traveling with a car of freight and the time of their arrival is uncertain.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Members Find the Editor-Manager an Expensive Luxury.</head>
                            <p>One large white elephant, weary and footsore, has been left on the exposition executive committee's hands through the industry of Manager Rosewater.  The elephant includes a signal corps, two big war balloons and several little ones, all of which were used at Santiago, and were contracted for at Montauk Point by the editor-manager.</p>
                            <p>Seven carloads of stuff arrived, and with them a freight bill for $2,874, which so staggered the committee that it hasn't unloaded the cars yet and doesn't know when it will.  But Captain Yancey of the signal corps came on apace, and has fed the elephant by announcing that he will need a house forty by forty feet on the ground and fifty feet high, and another little house by the side of it for generating gas, and that he desires to inflate the big balloons quite often, at a cost of $125 per inflate.</p>
                            <p>Of course, the exposition is expected to pay for all of this, save the majority of the committeemen, who are doing some expecting on their own account.  To make the situation in earnest and real, ten men arrived yesterday from Montauk Point, all members of the signal corps, to help carry out these plans, and ten more men are expected in a day or two.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee Prepares an Elaborate Program for October 7.</head>
                            <p>The committee on German day held a preliminary meeting at Turner's hall last evening.  It was decided that German day should be October 7.  While no specific arrangements were made for the celebration the general character of the entertainments were outlined.  An elaborate vocal and instrumental concert conducted by the Orpheus society of this city, but including talent from various parts of the country, will be held in the Auditorium.</p>
                            <p>In the morning there will be a parade and <choice><sic>followin gthis</sic><corr>following this</corr></choice> speeches at the Auditorium.  The speakers have not yet been selected, but celebrities from Chicago and St. Louis will be invited to deliver addresses on this occasion.  German societies from all over Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa will receive invitations to be present.  Special agents will be sent through these states to extend the invitations.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Omaha Lines Agree on What They Will Do to Encourage Travel.</head>
                            <head type="sub">UNION PACIFIC ANNOUNCES UTAH'S RATE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Twenty-Five Dollars for the Round Trip from Salt Lake with a Two Weeks' Limit&#8212;Other Tariffs Are Agreed Upon.</head>
                            <p>The Omaha terminal lines are not going to wait till Chairman MacRae of St. Paul gets ready to call a meeting of the Jubilee rate committee before deciding what rates they will put into effect for that occasion.  Several of the principal lines entering the city have already decided what rates they will grant for Jubilee day at the exposition, and are only waiting for the formal committee meeting and its action to announce the rates.</p>
                            <p>General Passenger Agent Lomax of the Union Pacific has announced a round-trip rate of $25 from Utah common points to Omaha for the Peace Jubilee at the exposition.  This rate is about equivalent to a rate of 1 cent per mile, Salt Lake City being 1,068 miles from Omaha.  Tickets will be sold for trains leaving Utah on the evenings of October 9 and all day on October 10.  The day set apart for President McKinley here is October 12.  The tickets will be good to return any time up to October 26, inclusive.  September 14 was set aside as Utah day at the exposition, and a round trip rate of $25 announced.  Not many people from that state came in, however, on account of the death of President Woodruff of the Mormon church, and the services that followed.  It is therefore expected that a great crowd of Utah folks will be here to help welcome President McKinley at the Peace Jubilee.</p>
                            <p>Both the Union Pacific and the Burlington roads have practically agreed on rates for the Peace Jubilee from points nearer Omaha than Salt Lake City, but it is considered inadvisable to announce these rates before October 1 for fear of hurting the attendance between now and the date of the Jubilee.  It is assured that a low line of rates will be the outcome of the committee meeting whenever Chairman MacRae gets ready for that meeting to convene.  It is probable that a blanket, or <choice><sic>maxium</sic><corr>maximum</corr></choice>, rate will be made from point within 250 miles of Omaha for the occasion.  The blanket rates previously made by Omaha lines for Ak-Sar-Ben weeks here proved very successful in drawing good crowds.</p>

                            <p>The star and crescent rule the exposition today and the grounds are surrendered to the picturesque festivities of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine.  The camels on which the weary travelers have journeyed from far off lands to the fertile oasis crop contentedly at the green herbage, while the nobles and their ladies enjoy the hospitality of Tangier and Sesastris.  The Shriners constitute a numerous party, and the fez and tassel is everywhere conspicuous in the crowd.  Their program contemplates an entire day of relaxation and amusement and it was begun this morning by the formal welcome which was extended to them by the Nebraska temples, the city and the exposition officials.</p>
                            <p>The nobles began to gather in the Auditorium soon after 9 o'clock, and here they were received by the local committee and provided with badges and programs.  The big building was lavishly decorated with banners emblematic of the order and zemzem was served from numerous bowls to those who required refreshment.  The Omaha Concert band rendered a short program of popular music while the nobles were congregating, and then Noble Henry Hardy, illustrious potentate of Tangier temple, briefly bade the wanderers welcome in behalf of Tangier and Sesostris temples.  He suggested that it afforded him especial gratification to extend

                            a means of enjoyment which all would appreciate.  He said that it is unnecessary to multiply words to tell how sincerely glad they are to entertain the visiting nobles, for such occasions give to life its brightest recollections.  After commenting on the ennobling charities that represented one of the objects of the organization, he introduced Noble Frank E. Moores, mayor of Omaha, who extended a welcome in behalf of the city.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>

                            <p>Mayor Moores declared that Omaha felt highly favored, as it had been selected as the most fertile oasis in this hemisphere.  In years gone by the drouth had made the sands so hot that even Shriners had to step high and often, but now the sun of prosperity is once more shining.  In conclusion he presented the visitors with the golden keys to the city and invited them to take anything they wanted that was not nailed down.</p>
                            <p>In behalf of the exposition management President Wattles expressed the pleasure with which its gates were opened to these guests.  He declared that no social or benevolent organization was better known all over the world than the Order of the Mystic Shrine.  Wherever an intelligent, progressive, Christian community exists the order is found.  The beneficial influence that it exerts in every community is so well known and appreciated that whenever the Shriners meet they are received with the heartfelt greeting of brother to brother.</p>
                            <p>Continuing President Wattles eulogized the magnificence of the exposition and the value of the lesson that it teaches.  He spoke of the wonderful resources that are here exploited and declared that he now had the pleasure of welcoming the nobles to a place of education and entertainment that is unsurpassed.</p>
                            <p>To these greetings E. F. Allen of Kansas City, imperial potentate, responded in a very graceful address.  He said no people in the world are more capable of appreciating the lavish hospitality that has been extended to them than the Shriners.  They meet in a great city, that has long since been recognized as one of the commercial centers of the west.  Its people are unsurpassed in culture and refinement.  Their palaces of industry and commerce and their edifices of art and education command the admiration of all beholders.  To the north, south and west stretches a country almost limitless in its territorial expanse and unbounded in its wealth.  In conclusion he extolled the Shrine as exploiting the highest type of American citizenship and again expressed the grateful appreciation with which the hospitalities of the occasion were requited.</p>
                            <p>This was the end of the formal program, but in response to a hearty invitation Noble John Wesley Geiger of Cedar Rapids, Ia., entertained them with a characteristic address.  His remarks bristled with humorous sallies that were evidently hugely appreciated, and then Noble S. Wright Butler was called out to add a few more of the same kind.  After the exercises the nobles were entertained at lunch at Markel's cafe and at 2 o'clock they began a series of informal calls at the various state buildings.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PLAN FOR SHAM BATTLE TODAY.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Sioux Will Attack the Allied Camp and Will Make the Fur Fly.</head>
                            <p>Weather permitting, the sham battle between the Sioux Indians and the members of the other tribes will occur at 5 o'clock this evening on the grounds north and west of the Apiary building.  The last rehearsal was given yesterday afternoon and it was successful in every particular.  The forces were arranged much the same as they will be this afternoon, the 150 Sioux being on one side and the Blackfeet, Omahas, Apaches, Assiniboines and other Indians on the other.</p>
                            <p>At the sham battle fought some weeks ago a number of white men participated, but this one will be for Indians only.  They will run the entire show and the whites will be simply spectators.  The Sioux will occupy the open space at the east end of the grounds and will be commanded by Little-Red-Dog, who is conceded to be one of the brainiest warriors of the tribe.  He is cool headed, sagacious, brave and a great organizer.  While he is a young man and has never participated in any real fights, he has had for a tutor such men as Red Cloud, Spotted Tail and some of the best men of the Sioux nation.  Tomorrow afternoon great things are expected of him.</p>
                            <p>The allied forces that will combat the Sioux will be under the leadership of Big Brown Bear, a member of the Blackfeet tribe, and Young-Man-Who-Rode-the-Elk, a Apache.  The former will look after the movements of the northern Indians, while the latter will look after the forces from the southern country.  Both men have reputations as fighters, the former having led several campaigns against the Indians of British America, while the latter, at the head of the band, has in the past invaded Mexico and has always returned home covered with glory.</p>
                            <p>At this time there are 300 ponies in the Indian camp, nearly enough for mounts for all of the able-bodied men.  Those who do not go into the fight on horseback will hang around the edges of the skirmish line and will attend to torturing the captives with firebrands, knives and other instruments that are relics of a bygone age.</p>
                            <p>The tents in the central portion of the Indian village will be removed and at this point the hottest fighting will wake place.  The Sioux will be coming in from a big horsestealing expedition, when all of a sudden they will locate some tepees in the distance.  They will hold a council of war, after which a scouting party will be sent out.  A few minutes later the members of this party will return and will report that Big Brown Bear, at the head of a big force of Indians, is in camp.  They will report that these Indians are painted and apparently spoiling for a fight.  When the report is being made, Big Brown Bear will be arousing his men from their slumbers and getting them ready for the fray, after which they will look after their guns and blank cartridges, which will be furnished by Captain Mercer.</p>
                            <p>While all of this is going on in the camp of Mr. Bear, Little Red Dog will be debating a question with his braves, some of whom will advise waiting until Sunday morning before dashing down upon the foe.  It will be then that Mr. Dog will draw himself up to his full height and inform his followers that being Christians, they must not delay the battle until Sunday.  He will wax eloquent and will recount the deeds of his forefathers and will tell his men about filling enemies full of cold lead and then unsheathing the scalping knives and twisting their blades around in the vitals of the foe.  This little play will fire the enthusiasm of the Indians, and they will vote to go into the fight instanter and not spare man, woman or child.  Having settled the mooted question, Little Red Dog will give the command and at the head of the band of painted braves, will swoop down upon the camp like a whirlwind.  However, he will not have things all his own way, for while he has been haranguing his followers the enemy will have prepared for the coming.</p>
                            <p>The forces of the Bear and the Elk, instead of being surprised, will surprise Mr. Dog, and after they have killed a number of his men and captured several more, will send the balance back in great disorder.  This order of exercises will be repeated several times, in fact, until all of the ammunition has been shot away, after which it will be decided that the Sioux have won the day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Regarding "Trilby."</head>
                            <p>OMAHA, Sept. 13.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  An article appeared in The Bee of yesterday signed Ethel Evans and severely scoring the painting "Trilby," by Cooper, now being exhibited at the exposition.  So caustic were the comments and so unusual that I think they call for a reply.  She begins at the feet and continues to the head and after she has finished poor "Trilby" has apparently not a foot to stand upon.  She says the figure is not correctly drawn, the left hip too hight, the neck too thick and <choice><sic>course</sic><corr>coarse</corr></choice>, and that a surgeon would say that she ought to be sent to the hospital as one of the limbs is longer than the other.  And all this after "Trilby" has been exhibited for three years in all of the principal cities of the country, Boston, New York, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Chicago and a great many other art centers, and has been pronounced by some of the best critics and artists to be a grand picture!  In the first place, if Ethel Evans will secure a model and pose her in the same position that the model for "Trilby" was posed in she will find that she is entirely mistaken, and if she will come again and carefully study the picture I am sure that she will apologize to "Trilby."  The feet being foreshortened would make them appear small for the figure unless this fact were taken into consideration, then the arms being uplifted would have the effect of making the neck look much shorter and thicker than if the arms were down.  Then again, the figure is much larger than life, being six feet and one inch high, and when standing close and selecting any one part for criticism such things as the eyes and mouth, or other parts of the figure might seem too large unless this fact was taken into consideration.  The picture should be viewed at a distance of at least thirty feet away to get the proper proportion.  She asks, "Who is Cooper?"  And because she does not happen to know him personally she says much as the prize fighter who is challenged, "Go and get a reputation before I will recognize you."  I might ask, "Where did this art critic get her wonderful knowledge of art?"  Has she painted any picture that has attracted universal attention?  Cooper is well known in art circles from San Francisco to Boston.  His paintings are to be found in the Crocker gallery, Sacramento, also in the galleries of St. Louis, Chicago and other cities, and his works can be found in private collections throughout the country, but if he had never painted anything but "Trilby" that should be sufficient to give him a reputation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Reinhart of Milwaukee, probably one of the best critics in America, pronounces "Trilby" a great thing.  Prof. Silli of the Cincinnati Medical college, who delivers the anatomical lectures for the college, brought his entire class to view "Trilby" when it was in Cincinnati, so did the professor of anatomy of the Tulane Medical college in New Orleans, and each of these gentlemen gave me permission to say for them that "Trilby" was the grandest picture from an anatomical standpoint that they had ever seen.  Scores of others could be quoted if space would permit.  Mr. William H. Hunt is quoted in the article as saying "That in American everything resolves itself into getting money and selling a poor picture instead of a good one."  What an unjust statement!  Look at the grand works of art by Munkacsy, Bougereau, Makart, Duprey and scores of other modern painters whose works have been sold at fabulous prices, to say nothing of the old masters purchased in this country.  In New York recently a picture by Fortuny sold for $42,000, so Mr. Hunt was wrong.  American appreciate art and will pay for it.  They also appreciate good exhibition pictures and will visit them.  "Trilby" has been visited by more than 2,000,000 people who enjoy art and will continue to draw the multitudes despite such criticism as this article refers to.  Ninety-nine out of every 100 visitors say that it is grand.  The eastern press and artists have been lavish in their praise of it, yet Ethel Evans says "They have eyes and see not."  She forgets the fact that some people "Look through a glass darkly" when attempting criticism.  She also forgets that there are several kinds of art, just as there are several kinds of horses, and that all pictures should not be criticised alike any more than a race horse should be criticised for not being able to draw a heavy load.  Again I will invite Miss Evans to come and take an unprejudiced view of "Trilby" and I also feel like saying of her, "Come, let us reason together."  Respectfully,</p>

                            <head type="sub">Efforts to Rescue Standing Elk Result in the Annihilation of the Dakota Warriors Under Goes-to-War's Leadership.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Although they were only playing a part, there were scenes and incidents at the Indian camp yesterday afternoon that stirred the blood of many of the old warriors and made them live over the days of their youth when their tribes were at war with one another.  While it was only a mimic affray, to some of the old-timers, it was so real that frequently they almost forgot themselves and threatened to turn fun into earnest.  It was a sham battle between Indians and it was a glorious success in every particular.  It was an event in the history of the exposition, wherein 100 Sioux warriors were pitted against double their number, and while they were not victorious, they fought like demons and caused many a red man to bite the dust before they were completely annihilated.</p>
                            <p>All of yesterday the Indians at the exposition had been preparing for the battle.  They were given to understand that it would be a fight between the Sioux on one side and the allied forces on the other.  The early part of the day they devoted to painting their ponies all of the colors of the rainbow.  This having been accomplished, they next turned their attention to themselves, and when they were ready to appear upon the battle field, in color, most of them resembled a crazy quilt.  They were painted all colors and shades and disfigured with all kinds of designs and as they were nearly naked, it was not a difficult matter to observe the effect secured by the brush.</p>
                            <p>During the afternoon the Sioux selected Goes-to-War as their chief to lead them into the fight, while Knows-No-Fear, a Ponca, was designated as the commander of the allied forces, with each of the thirty other tribes having its own officer in charge.  These Indians got out and practiced their men, telling them just what to do, after which they all returned to their camps to await the signal for participating in the fight.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Explain Their Plan of Campaign.</head>
                            <p>Just before 5 o'clock Goes-to-War and Knows-No-Fear, arm in arm, walked out into the center of the grounds and uttered three long-drawn war whoops, which echoed and reverberated over, around and across the grounds.  A moment later Indians decked in feathers, war toggery and paint emerged from the tepees and hurried to the spot where the chiefs were standing.  These chiefs explained that the battle was to be for the amusement of the whites and that while it would be in fun, it was the intention to make everything appear as natural and real as possible.  They were told that a Sioux was to be captured and tied to the stake, that he was to be rescued by his associates, who would drive off the allied forces.  That the Sioux would capture a number of prisoners, torture some and kill others, and that eventually they would be swept off the face of the earth.</p>
                            <p>After this word had been passed along the line the Indians were allowed to retire to their tepees, where they remained a short time.  A party of Sioux congregated over in the vicinity of the Indian store and after calling the roll, discovered that one of their number, Standing Elk, had disappeared and <unclear reason="torn"/>ning. <unclear reason="torn"/> this time White Buffalo came riding up and reported that Standing Elk had been captured by a big war party that was hiding down in the vicinity of the big trees in the west end of the lot.  Goes-to-War asked his men what they thought of that.  They all in one voice declared they would have the life blood of the man who had captured Standing Elk.  That settled it and Goes-to-War could not have prevented the fight if he had felt so disposed.</p>
                            <p>As the battle was only to be a show, tribe after tribe rode up to the grand stand in front of the Indian congress, where Storekeeper Hegge performed the social functions and introduced the chiefs, as well as telling to what tribes the Indians belonged.  This little side play having been disposed of everything was ready for the battle and the stuff was off.  War songs set to the most dismal tunes were turned loose from all parts of the grounds, while the Sioux, mounted and on foot took up their position over in the east end of the lot, driving the spectators, of which there were 15,000, close up against the ropes.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Having Fun with a Prisoner.</head>
                            <p>Like a whirlwind they rode down through the grounds to the central portion, where Standing Elk was discovered bound hand and foot and tied to an electric light pole.  Not knowing what the Indians who were around him, singing and dancing, intended to do, they stopped and waited a few minutes.  During this brief interval, Afraid-of-His-Tracks walked up to Standing Elk and throwing dirt in his face, called him a coward.  Standing Elk was not in a position to resent the insult, but he begged to be let loose, saying that if the thongs were cut, inside of five minutes he could whip Afraid-of-His-Tracks and all of his greasy associates.  No one seemed willing to give Standing Elk the chance, but they kept right on having fun with him.  They taunted him, threw dust in his eyes, called him a squaw, said that he would even chop wood and carry water.  Standing Elk waited and tried to break away, but the ropes were too strong and he couldn't do a thing but wait for an opportunity to get even, which opportunity came later on.</p>
                            <p>Having had all the fun they could with the man who had been doomed to die at the stake, Yellow Eagle said it was time to get down to business.  All of the other Indians howled their approval and Comes-a-Running, who is just out of the hospital, was deputized to get things ready for the frying.  He hustled out under a tree and gathered up a lot of straw, which he brought in and scattered around Standing Elk and the post to which he was tied.  Then there was another dismal song, after which the match was applied.  The flames caught the dry straw and leaped into the air, while Jumps-High-in-the-Air walked up to Standing Elk, twisted his nose and called him a coward.  All this time "the flames rolled on," but in less time than it takes to tell it, they stopped their rolling.</p>
                            <p>From the east came a dark cloud.  As neared it was discovered that it was a body of Sioux warriors.  They swooped down upon the band around the warrior who was tied to the stake.  There was a clash of arms and then a heavy firing of rifles which continued for fifteen minutes.  At the end of this time and after the smoke had cleared away it was seen that some forty Indians had been killed or wounded, a score captured and Standing Elk leaning over Jumps-High-in-the-Air, apparently just ready to plunge a knife into his heart.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Final Rout of the Sioux.</head>
                            <p>The Sioux made short work of the wounded.  They put them to death by tomahawking them and then tearing off their scalps.  The captives were bound to the nearest electric light poles and straw piled high about them.  Around the poles the Sioux danced and howled, while the squaws, who had followed the party in, joined in the chorus and ground out the most bloodcurdling music that has been heard in this part for many days.  The torch was applied to the piles of straw and just as the flames were getting uncomfortably close to the men who were tied, Knows-No-Fear came riding back with his entire party.  He threw out a line of skirmishers and then surrounded the Sioux with his command, having them as sure to rights as though they had been rats in a trap.  The Sioux fired right and left, but while they were not outclassed, they were outnumbered, and as each volley was fired into their ranks, they went down like ripe grain before the reaper.  While the allied forces <choice><sic>wre</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> killing and scalping Sioux, a party was releasing the captives who had commenced to think that there were not to be in at the killing.  They were, however, and tomahawk in hand, the men wrought great havoc among the wounded, it being estimated that they put twenty Sioux to death.</p>
                            <p>The Sioux were given a chance to surrender, but knowing that surrender meant death at the stake, Goes-to-War rallied his warriors about him and entrenching themselves behind the little trees that grow about the water tank in the center of grounds, fought until the last man fell, either killed or wounded, he being the last to go down.  Strange to relate, when the allied forces went around to put the wounded to death and perform the scalping act, none of them mutilated the body of Goes-to-War, they regarding him too brave a man to be subjected to such treatment even after death.</p>
                            <p>The pretended killing of Goes-to-War ended the battle, and as all of the ammunition had been shot away, the Indians passed before the reviewing stand, being cheered loud and long, after which they hied themselves to their tepees, washed off the paint, pulled off the war bonnets, and a few minutes later, emerged, dressed in the clothes of the everyday Indians or the suit peculiar to the average citizen, feeling that they had given the public a good show.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Famous Apache Terror Heads a Long Procession of Warriors.</head>
                            <p>Travelers who happened to be at the Union station yesterday noon were treated to a novel sight.  The noon express from the west on the Rock Island conveyed a camp of American Indians, fresh from the tepees and lodges of the Fort Sill military reservation.  The exposition was their destination.  There were Cheyennes, Arapahoes and Wichitas, Apaches, Kiowas and Chiricahuas and for two hours they bivouacked in true Indian fashion on the station platform while their accoutrements were being loaded on wagons and carted away.  There were copper-skins representing every degree and condition of Indian life, every stage of civilization, from the erudite John Smith, attired in a worn but up-to-date frock coat, who teaches the government schools, down to old Geronimo, the grizzled old terror of the whole southwest, garbed in beaded buckskin, grotesque blankets, feathers and warpaint.  They jabbered and grinned and kept sharp lookout to see that none of the crowd stole their trappings for keepsakes, while several hundred spectators looked on with interest.</p>
                            <p>There were 125 of them all told.  Six are enlisted government scouts, twenty-two are prisoners of war under the old warrior chief Geronimo and the rest are just plain Indians who live on Uncle Sam's reservations and draw rations.  Squaws attired in blankets, which for bright colors surpass imagination, their long jet black hair braided with variegated ribbons, crooning papooses strapped to their backs and braves blanketed and greasy.  The men wore beaded moccasins, tin bracelets and hair braided and tied with beaver tails.  Miniature tomahawks hung in their ears and their bronze colored skin was almost concealed by brilliant paint.  The bucks smoked pipes and jabbered.  The squaws stood in groups and looked on.</p>
                            <p>The enlisted scouts in the party are To-<unclear reason="torn"/> Apache.  Lieutenant Thompson of <unclear reason="torn"/> I. T., is detailed to look after them.  The rest of the outfit, including fifty-one ponies, is in charge of James Mooney, who was sent by the Department of the Interior.  G. W. Gaines, commissary of the Indian department at the exposition, met the party and conducted them to their quarters at the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The Apaches got to the grounds just in time to witness the sham battle, and during the affray they were Captain Mercer's guests, occupying seats on the high portico that has been erected just inside the fence.  In addition to Geronimo, Natchee is in the party.  This Indian is Geronimo's head man, and is said to have had more to do with the raids against the whites than the old man himself.  Geronimo is 63 years of age and straight as an arrow.  He is of medium height and quite heavy.  He does not speak English, though he understands considerable of the language.  He is a chronic grumbler, and this was decidedly noticeable yesterday.  Immediately after arriving in camp, he commenced finding fault because tents had not been erected before he and his party came.  Then he grumbled because dinner had not been prepared and was awaiting his arrival.</p>
                            <p>Tents for the Apaches have been erected east of those occupied by the Assiniboines, on the north side of the grounds, where they will go into camp.  Most of the Apaches are good looking people.  Their women are not beauties, but they are much better looking than their northern sisters.  They, as well as the men, are small, much smaller than the Indians residing in the northern states.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DANCING FOR THE OLD TIMERS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Fourteen Tribes of Indians Engage in a Most Pleasing Presentation.</head>
                            <p>The old time and military telegraphers visited the Indian encampment last night in a body and were entertained with a big war dance in which nearly every tribe in the village participated.  In this respect it was a remarkable event.  It is safe to assert that it was the first time such a combination of red men have ever mingled in the fantastic figures of the war dance.  There were members of fourteen tribes in the big circle around the camp fire, and some of them have been hereditary enemies since long before the white man invaded their domains.  The Crows and Blackfeet danced side by side with the Sioux and Cheyennes, wit whom they have waged interminable war for uncounted generations.  The Flatheads were also old-time enemies of the Sioux and among the old warriors in the dance were some who had themselves fought each other with all the ferocity that a hereditary hate could inspire until the powerful hand of Uncle Sam had confined them to their reservations.  To most of the crowd there was no distinction between the painted and feather warriors in the dancing circle, but old timers who recollected how recently the Sioux and Crows delighted in catching each other at a disadvantage and killing without quarter, wondered if the old ferocity altogether slumbered as they brushed their old-time enemies in their evolutions.</p>
                            <p>But if old grudges were remembered, it was not apparent for to all appearances the braves all entered into the spirit of the dance as though they were on their own reservations.  There were upwards of a hundred bucks in the circle and as the squaws who were seated in the center beat the tom-toms and raised their weird song they joined in the stately step with which the dance begins.  That the Indian is not without some musical conception is apparent, for no matter how furious the dance became the bells that were hung on the leggins of the dancers jingled in perfect time.  As the braves became warmed up they dropped the stately poise that accompanied their initial efforts and assumed positions suggestive of a sure-enough fight.  Here and there an old warrior crept along as though in anticipation of pouncing on an unsuspecting enemy and so well was the pantomime acted that it was clearly intelligible to even the most uninitiated observer.  After a time the bucks wearied and dropped back to the outer edge of the circle to rest.  After a brief interval the squaws renewed their fantastic song and the warriors returned to the dance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Second Day's Session Sees a Bigger Crowd and More Interest in the Running Debate.</head>
                            <p>The second day's session of the Bee Keepers' union was much more largely attended than were the meetings of the opening day.  The session opened with the usual convention song and invocation.  These were followed by a short address by the president of the union, George W. York of Chicago.  He referred to the fraud of adulteration and the many impure products that are being put on the market and sold as honey.  He advised that some means by taken to secure a conviction and advocated co-operation in marketing to insure the producers a wider demand and a better price for the best grade of honey.</p>
                            <p>After the reading of the paper a general discussion was engaged in, touching upon the points referred to by Mr. York.  The prevailing sentiment is in favor of securing a conviction of fraudulent honey manufacturers.  No definite conclusion was reached as to the best way to proceed.  It is suggested that the general manager of the union either purchase or engage someone else to purchase samples of adulterated honey, and proceed with full power to act.  This question will be taken up at a later session with the view of making it hot for somebody.</p>
                            <p>The discussion drifted into a consideration of the best articles of supplies.  A paper by C. C. Miller of Marengo, Ill., entitled "Bee Keepers and Supply Manufacturers" started the delegates on several roads of argument.  Two of the questions considered were, "Should the hard side of the board be inside or outside the frame?"  "Is a cement nail better than a wire nail?"</p>
                            <p>At the close of the discussion of nails and frames the meeting was addressed by former Governor Saunders.</p>
                            <p>Eight papers were read during the afternoon and three in the evening.  An hour was taken up in the afternoon by the election of officers for the coming year, which resulted as follows:  President, E. Whitcomb of Friend, Neb.; vice president, C. A. Hatch of Ithaca, Wis.; secretary, Dr. A. B. Mason of Toledo, O.  These three officers compose the executive committee of the union.</p>
                            <p>The first paper of the afternoon was read by Prof. Lawrence Bruner of the University of Nebraska on "Bees in America."  He gave a scholarly and interesting account of the history and habits of the two distinct families found north of the Mexican boundary.  His talk did not dwell to a great extent upon the honeybee of the apiary, whose peculiarities are so well known to all bee keepers.  But he interested his hearers with an account of those species not so well known to them, including the <choice><sic>parisitic</sic><corr>parasitic</corr></choice> and the leaf cutting species.  He dwelt on the usefulness of the wild bees in fertilizing plants, showing that, although not of use on account of the honey they store up, they fill their place in nature and are necessary.</p>
                            <p>A paper by C. P. Dadant of Hamilton, Ill., on "The Scientific Side of Apiculture" was read by the secretary.  This article <unclear reason="torn"/> in regard to the most advantageous size of hives.  C. A. Hatch, who has spent twenty years in experiments, gave as his conclusion that the amount of honey obtained depends more upon the system of management than upon the size of the hives.</p>
                            <p>Hon. Eugene Secor of Forest City, Ia., read a paper on "A Half-Century of Bee-Keeping in America," which was a careful, concise and elegant review of the growth of the industry.  He contrasted the rude methods in use fifty years ago with those of today and referred to the great ignorance of bees and their habits at so recent a date.  The consequent enormous increase in the production of honey was shown by statistics.  He scored the framers of ordinances forbidding apiaries within corporate limits.</p>
                            <p>The business of the convention ended with the session last evening, at which the reports of the general <choice><sic>manger</sic><corr>manager</corr></choice> and the secretary were read and several changes were made in the constitution.  Three papers were read.  The first was by Rev. E. T. Abbott of St. Joseph, Mo., on "General Advice to Bee Keepers."  This paper was to have been presented at the first session, but was passed over because Mr. Abbott was unable to be present.  It contained many valuable hints of a practical nature relative to the best system of caring for and managing colonies.  Then followed a paper by G. M. Whitford entitled, "The Relation Existing Between the Apiary and the Successful Production of Fruit."  Mr. Whitford owns one of the largest colonies of bees in the state at Arlington, Neb., and has found by actual experience that his orchards are bearing fruit in much greater abundance since he has become a beekeeper.  He accounts for the increased production by reference to the bee as a fertilizer.  The last paper of the convention was read by the newly elected president, E. Whitcomb.  His subject was, "The Apiary on the Farm and in the Orchard."</p>
                            <p>A short discussion followed the reading of the article and Prof. S. J. Hunter of the University of Kansas was introduced.  Mr. Hunter has been spending the summer among the alfalfa in western Kansas and has been making experiments regarding its productivity of honey.  He reported as the result of his observations up to date that alfalfa under the same climatic conditions will yield more honey than white clover.  But he said that the irrigated plant is far less productive than that which has had the advantage of rainfall excepting where the rain has come too copiously.  These remarks opened a discussion that soon became very interesting.  Some of the delegates said that they knew of conditions under which alfalfa yielded scarcely any honey and in some districts none at all.</p>
                            <p>Before adjourning the delegates adopted the following resolutions:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the hearty thanks of this society be and are hereby extended to the local members of the Nebraska Bee-Keepers' society for the time, labor and pleasure of this convention.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we appreciate the courtesy of the Commercial club of the city of Omaha in providing us with these pleasant rooms.</p>

                            </table>
                            <p>Although the celebration of New England day is of a very unpretentious character, the crowd promises to largely exceed that of the average day.  This is largely due to the fact that the railroads are hauling the people in increasing numbers and the delightful weather brings everyone to the grounds.  If the visitors had been permitted to order sunshine and inspiriting breezes as they do their groceries they could not have secured more delightful conditions than those which surrounded them today.  It is the beginning of the enchanting Indian summer of Nebraska.  There is just enough breeze stirring to keep the atmosphere from becoming stagnant and the light autumn haze is sufficient to temper the sunlight to the exact extent that is desirable for comfort.  It is the sort of a day that compels the visitor to enjoy even mediocre attractions and under its influence the exposition is an inspiration to the most extravagant admiration.</p>
                            <p>Some time ago the local societies of New Englanders planned to have a big celebration, with speeches by Tom Reed and other distinguished citizens of their native states.  But they were unable to secure the orators at this time and consequently this is New England day only in name.  The local societies are largely represented in the attendance, but their presence is signalized by no demonstration and the features were confined to the ordinary attractions of the day.</p>
                            <p>There is a satisfactory prospect that the celebration of Oklahoma day tomorrow will be quite a notable event.  The very low rates that have been made by one or two of the southern lines have brought in large numbers of people already and later these will be reinforced by a number of big excursions from Oklahoma and Texas.  President J. C. Post of the Oklahoma commission is on the grounds this morning, and he is confident that his state will do itself proud on this occasion.  He says it will be represented by a crowd that will compare very favorably with those which have attended the celebrations of other states, and most of the people will remain at the exposition for several days.  The exercises of the day will occur at the Auditorium tomorrow forenoon and will consist of addresses by Governor Barnes, Major E. A. Wilson of Darlington, J. C. Roberts of Kingfisher and President Wattles of the exposition.  Governor Holcomb will also speak if he is able to be present.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Antelope State Saves Another Fruit Occasion When Others Flunk.</head>
                            <p>Tomorrow will be observed as Grape day and so far as grapes are concerned the situation will be identical with Peach day, which was observed on September 2.  At that time all of the peaches were supplied by Nebraska, and tomorrow Nebraska will furnish all of the grapes, the other states having flunked.</p>
                            <p>Some days ago Superintendent Youngers sent out notices to the grape growers of the state, telling them what would be expected of them and as a result twelve tons of grapes are now on hand, with seven tons more coming, due to arrive tonight.  This great quantity of grapes will be carted to the Horticultural building tonight and will be stacked in great piles on the space now occupied by the tables which hold the fruit.  The grapes will be in baskets and as soon as <unclear reason="torn"/> of boys and girls will be set to work transferring the fruit to paper sacks holding four pounds each.  Across the face of each sack will be printed in large letters the words "Grape day.  These grapes were raised in Nebraska and are given to visitors to the exposition."</p>
                            <p>As the people pass through the Horticulture building from the west entrance they will be given the sacks, filled with the fruit, and in addition, they will be given peaches or apples.  Of the peaches there will be over 500 cases, while there will be no end to the apples, several hundred barrels being on hand.</p>
                            <p>In anticipation of a big crowd at the Horticulture building, the guard force will be doubled in the vicinity and an extra ticket seller will be placed at the Spencer street gate, just below the Georgia State building.</p>

                            <p>In the competitive fruit exhibit made by Nebraska counties the judges have made their awards and the fruit will be removed from the tables and the general exhibit made by the state will take its place.  The display was made in the Horticultural building under the auspices of the Nebraska Horticultural society.  The display was unusually large and the quality was fine.</p>
                            <p>Each year the Nebraska Horticultural society encourages an exhibit of fruit, which is made at the state fair, but as no fair is held this year the exhibit is made at the exposition.  In the awarding of premiums to counties making the largest and best exhibit Nemaha was given first prize, Pawnee second, Fillmore third, Sarpy fourth and Washington fifth.  For the best individual collection of fruit H. S. Christie of Johnson county won first prize, C. H. Barnard of Table Rock second, G. A. Marshall of Arlington third and A. J. Brown of Geneva fourth.</p>
                            <p>When it came to pears, H. S. Christie took first prize, C. H. Barnard second and O. P. Dovel of Auburn third.  On summer apples Marshall took first money, Barnard second and Brown third.  On autumn apples first money went to Barnard, second to Marshall and third to Brown.  On winter apples&#8212;ten varieties&#8212;Barnard was given first, Brown second and Marshall third.  On five varieties of winter apples prizes were as follows:  Brown first, Barnard second and Marshall third.</p>
                            <p>The grape exhibit was a large one, with many exhibitors.  For ten varieties the first prize went to John Furnas, second, C. C. Marshall, and third, Barnard; five varieties for the market Marshall took first, Christie second and Barnard third.  Grapes for table, Marshall first, Christie second and Barnard third.</p>
                            <p>In the competition on quinces Christie took first prize and Dovel second, while in peaches J. M. Russell of Wymore took first money and Christie second.  In plums first went to Fred Behler of Columbus and second to G. A. Marshall of Arlington.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Annual Convention of the Union Elects Officers and Finishes Up Its Program Work.</head>
                            <p>Eight papers were read before the Bee Keepers' union during the afternoon session Wednesday and three in the evening.  An hour was taken up in the afternoon by the election of officers for the coming year, which resulted as follows:  President, E. Whitcomb of Friend, Neb.; vice president, C. A. Hatch of Ithaca, Wis.; secretary, Dr. A. B. Mason of Toledo, O.  These three officers compose the executive committee of the union.</p>
                            <p>The first paper of the afternoon was read by Prof. Lawrence Bruner of the University of Nebraska on "Bees in America."  He gave a scholarly and interesting account of the history and habits of the two distinct families found north of the Mexican boundary.  His talk did not dwell to a great extent upon the honeybee of the apiary, whose peculiarities are so well known to all bee keepers.  But he interested his hearers with an account of those species not so well known to them, including the <choice><sic>parisitic</sic><corr>parasitic</corr></choice> and <unclear reason="torn"/>ies.  He dwelt on the usefulness of the wild bees in fertilizing plants, showing that, although not of use on account of the honey they store up, they fill their place in nature and are necessary.</p>
                            <p>A paper by C. P. Dadant of Hamilton, Ill., on "The Scientific Side of Apiculture" was read by the secretary.  This article brought out a most interesting discussion in regard to the most advantageous size of hives.  C. A. Hatch, who has spent twenty years in experiments, gave as his conclusion that the amount of honey obtained depends more upon the system of management than upon the size of the hives.</p>
                            <p>Hon. Eugene Secor of Forest City, Ia., read a paper on "A Half-Century of Bee-Keeping in America," which was a careful, concise and elegant review of the growth of the industry.  He contrasted the rude methods in use fifty years ago with those of today and referred to the great ignorance of bees and their habits at so recent a date.  The consequent enormous increase in the production of honey was shown by statistics.  He scored the framers of ordinances forbidding apiaries within corporate limits.</p>
                            <p>The business of the convention ended with the session last evening, at which the reports of the general <choice><sic>manger</sic><corr>manager</corr></choice> and the secretary were read and several changes were made in the constitution.  Three papers were read.  The first was by Rev. E. T. Abbott of St. Joseph, Mo., on "General Advice to Bee Keepers."  This paper was to have been presented at the first session, but was passed over because Mr. Abbott was unable to be present.  It contained many valuable hints of a practical nature relative to the best system of caring for and managing colonies.  Then followed a paper by G. M. Whitford entitled, "The Relation Existing Between the Apiary and the Successful Production of Fruit."  Mr. Whitford owns one of the largest colonies of bees in the state at Arlington, Neb., and has found by actual experience that his orchards are bearing fruit in much great abundance since he has become a beekeeper.  He accounts for the increased production by reference to the bee as a fertilizer.  The last paper of the convention was read by the newly elected president, E. Whitcomb.  His subject was, "The Apiary on the Farm and in the Orchard."</p>
                            <p>A short discussion followed the reading of the article and Prof. S. J. Hunter of the University of Kansas was introduced.  Mr. Hunter has been spending the summer among the alfalfa in western Kansas and has been making experiments regarding its productivity of honey.  He reported as the result of his observations up to date that alfalfa under the same climatic conditions will yield more honey than white clover.  But he said that the irrigated plant is far less productive than that which has had the advantage of rainfall excepting where the rain has come too copiously.  These remarks opened a discussion that soon became very interesting.  Some of the delegates said that they knew of conditions under which alfalfa yielded scarcely any honey and in some districts none at all.</p>
                            <p>Before adjourning the delegates adopted the following resolutions:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the heart thanks of this society be and are hereby extended to the local members of the Nebraska Bee-Keepers' society for the time, labor and pleasure of this convention.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we appreciate the courtesy of the Commercial club of the city of Omaha in providing us with these pleasant rooms.</p>
                            <p>The delegates will meet in the Apiary department of the exposition this morning at 9:30 o'clock for a short meeting, at which any business that was not attended to at the regular meetings will be brought up and the delegates will have an opportunity to see the various exhibits of honey.  The place where the meeting will be held next year will be decided upon by the executive committee.</p>

                            <p>The Exposition is now an assured financial success.  The weather is fine, and all things considered, the attendance is good.</p>
                            <p>The famous Mexican Military Band is delighting large audiences every day, the bright catchy music they play is very well received by the masses; the band is already a prime favorite, and as it came for a period of six weeks, it is with pleasure <unclear reason="covered"/> note it popularity.</p>
                            <p>September and October will see the Exposition at its best, and all who do not come and see it, will have something to regret as long as they live.</p>
                            <p>One hears the Exposition management very severely criticised for its method of doing business.  They forced Mr. Willard Kimball to resign, and appointed Mr. Thomas J. Kelley in his stead as Musical Director.  Mr. Kimball was a thoroughly incompetent man for the position and simply rattled around like a marble in a milk pail.  He failed utterly to give satisfaction to the regular patrons of the musical entertainments and the Exposition Management certainly deserve the hearty commendation of every well wisher of music for accepting Mr. Kimball's resignation.  Putting Mr. Kelley in his place, was the best and most available thing that could be done under the circumstances.  He is bright and quick and naturally a genius musically, but his opportunities for thorough study have been extremely limited.  In so far as Mr. Kelley has been allowed to manage the affairs of his department they have been a success.  But most all authority seems to have been arrogated to himself by Mr. Lindsey, Chairman of the Department of Ways and Means, or by him delegated to Miss Julia Officer.  Mr. Lindsey has found it necessary to rush into print with an apologetic defense of Miss Officer's business methods as shown up in THE CRITIC.  The writer is reliably informed that Mr. Kelley is frequently not consulted at all as to the musical features and one also hears the remark: "Well, Lindsey may know a <choice><sic>makintosh</sic><corr>mackintosh</corr></choice>, or a pair of rubber boots, but he knows precious little about music and musicians" (Mr. Lindsey is in the wholesale rubber trade); this and similar remarks are heard so often that we give it place.  We are not prepared to express any opinion on the subject, but believe he is a very much overworked man, for the Chairman of the Department of Ways and Means of an enterprise of the magnitude of the Trans Mississippi and International Exposition has no small job on his hands, and the subject of music is only an incident of his department, and as such can only occupy part of his time.  He is entitled to great credit for his honest hard work in making the Exposition a great success.  In his management of the department of music he has, however, shown a very short sighted and narrow policy in allowing his personal prejudices (and those of his family) to warp his otherwise good judgment.</p>
                            <p>On the whole, looking (as we try to do) calmly and dispassionately over the first three months of the exposition, the work of the department has been a lamentable failure, but we sincerely hope to redeem ourselves from now on.  We recognize the justice of the remark now often heard: "It is easy to criticise the Secretary of War, but quite another matter to equip 250,000 men and conduct to a successful conclusion a great International war, in four short months; so with this musical business; it is easy for us to see the mistakes that have been made, but could we have done any better?  We all think we could, but in that, perhaps, we are greatly mistaken.</p>

                            <p>Like all visitors to this pretty city I attended the Exposition and am enthusiastic over its beautiful buildings, grounds and environments that cannot fail, yes enthuse the average person.  Strolling about the grounds in the vicinity of the Auditorium I was made aware of the fact that the most interesting subject about was none other than Mr. Lindsay and a lady always in his wake, Miss Julia Officer.  The people are complaining, I understand, because this department does not pay.  Well, just deduct the 5, 10 and 15, etc., per cent paid Miss Officer and you will see a handsome amount with which the exchequer could be replenished.  You will perhaps say Miss Officer is entitled to a commission, as Mr. Lindsay himself says, and who takes good care, by the way, of Miss Officer.  I submit the following that you may see for yourself whether the poor singer or organist or the exposition coffers are tapped as this paper avers to fatten Miss <choice><sic>Officers</sic><corr>Officer's</corr></choice> purse.  Should the authorities desire they may investigate by visiting this city and thus be convinced that they are the ones being fleeced.</p>
                            <p>At the Auditorium Hotel some months ago Willard Kimball and Julia Officer held forth.  A star chamber session was held.  Among the stars (?) <choice><sic>where</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> Chicago artists (?) whose ability this city recognized as soloists in beer garden opera companies and others not recognized at all.  This was the aggregation I met there, with whom contracts were being made to appear at Omaha, and at prices exceeding by far what they could be engaged for, had not Miss Officer tacked on her 5, 10 or 15 per cent commission and also requested the additional increase for advertising the fact that "Miss Julia is the only authorized agent to engage artists, etc."  The artists themselves told me they paid a certain amount for this advertisement.  They also told me "they tacked on the commission at the suggestion of so and so."  Don't you believe it?"  Visit Chicago and ask the singers that have appeared and they will tell you that they would have appeared for the sum of money minus the commission in recital, etc., at Omaha.  Deduct these commissions and you gentlemen in authority at the exposition will see how much money you are out and have placed in plain English in Julia <choice><sic>Officers</sic><corr>Officer's</corr></choice> pockets.  The engaging of soloists is always the duty of the Musical Director without additional pay.  Musical history will have a novelty to record at which Omaha has agreed to give moneys allotted for music to a so called manager.  Boodle is all right in politics but I hope with the termination of matters at Omaha the musical world shall never witness a recurrence of the Lindsay-Officer commission scheme.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Thos. J. Kelly, Sup't. of the Bureau of Music at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition held in this city seems to be handicapped like his predecessor by the actions of Miss Julia Officer, who is allowed to engage whatever artist she chooses without even consulting the director, Mr. Kelley.  Why do the public shower complaints upon his head?  Has not the expose in this paper been sufficient?  Glance behind the throne and you will see that Mr. Kelly is but a mere figurehead (like his predecessor) and that Mr. Lindsay and Miss Officer are the powers that be and should therefore shoulder the blame.  Poor little Miss Officer; how her 2 x 4 studio in the Newberry Flats of Chicago, her one or two pupils and that city generally misses this great (?) pianist whom Omaha has selected to run her musical affairs.  Why do the moneyed men of Omaha who are backing this enterprise allow Mr. Lindsay to run this department in the interest of his friend, Miss Officer (who knows little if anything about music), to have a "sinch" in employing talent, when any manager would willingly send his stars without giving them to understand as Shylock did that the pound of flesh and blood as well must be forthcoming ere an engagement is made.</p>
                            <p>Why not let the musical director run matters musical?  Why insist, Mr. Lindsay, that the soloists desiring an engagement at this exposition should pay homage to Miss Officer?  It seems to me that a great deal more attention is paid to the opportunities offered of making money for Miss Officer, than to the engagement of the first class talent Omaha's people should hear.</p>
                            <p>A well known Chicago soprano was engaged to sing at the exposition.  Upon the culmination of arrangements for her concert appearance, Miss Officer asked the payment of the commission.  That the lady was a business woman as well as a singer, Miss Officer was convinced of by receiving the following response:  "When I receive my money, you shall receive yours and not before."</p>
                            <p>As an exhibition of ignorance, a contralto, Miss
                            
                            <pb n="170" xml:id="TMISB06-170"/>
                            
                            Estelle Rose, was engaged by Miss Officer "to sing the contralto solos in the Creation."  Good joke isn't it?  Miss Officer, the <choice><sic>impressario</sic><corr>impresario</corr></choice>, and everything else did not know that a contralto-solo was foreign to the Creation.  But bright (?) woman that she claims to be she would not be <choice><sic>eucered</sic><corr>euchred</corr></choice> out of her commission.  The contralto appeared as booked in the Creation.  A solo was interpolated for the contralto, thus gaining several points for Miss Officer viz.; a position for her contralto, a commission for herself and last but not least giving Omaha's musical people a modernized a la Officer edition of Haydn's great composition.  Mme. Officer, in lieu of the absence of Mr. Haydn, I doff my hat to so great (?) a musician of this century and one that dares improve upon his works.  A medal ought to be tendered her.  Yes, the exposition authorities can pride themselves upon one thing and that is that they have at least discovered an effeminate vintage of '53, whom is greater than Haydn.  Let our foreign composers remember this: that at Omaha is the only person daring to <choice><sic>corret</sic><corr>correct</corr></choice> or improve this famous composition.  Oh! by the way, I wish my cousins abroad would kindly reprint this, as rumor has it that Miss Officer will reproduce this work with her improvements at the Paris Exposition having in view the obtaining of decorations, medals, sheepskins, etc., from the Sig's Maccaroni and Spashetti of Milan; Monsieurs de Joy de Bric a Brac and on Ze Zeur at Paris and the Herrs Wiener de Bier and Pchor Brau at Munchen.  We have already given her ours, so with extreme sincerity we hope you, our foreign brothers, sisters, all along the line will give her her <choice><sic>hearts</sic><corr>heart's</corr></choice> most intrinsic desires, even the world if she asks therefore&#8212;which I am sure she will.</p>
                            <p>August 18th Miss Jeanette Durno, a Chicago pianist and a tenor, Mr. Pollock of New York (?), so Omaha authorities say, but known nevertheless in the west, appeared before a meagre audience due perhaps to their being unknown in the musical world.  Miss Durno played fairly well, which is more than could be said of her concert appearance in Chicago upon her return from abroad.  The affair was given under the auspices of Miss Julia Officer, whom dame rumor says, may start either a piano factory or newspaper with moneys received as commission from the various singers, etc., Omaha's Exposition patrons have been inundated with.</p>
                            <p>September 23, 24, 25 and 26 will witness a Choral Congress, inaugurated at the instance of Mr. Kelly and under his able management the congress bids fair to be a grand success.  The transportation department has arranged reduced rate for the visitors and the executive committee have kindly arranged for their free admittance to the exposition.  All the choirs in this vicinity have been invited to participate as well as join a monster chorus of eight hundred voices to be heard during this congress.

Mr. Phinney may be all right blowing a trumpet on horseback in Des Moines, Iowa, but as a director of a concert (?) band, I do believe he is a failure.  There must be a hoodoo and a lack of doo doo in his organization called for courtesies sake a band.  Such a conglomeration of sound by such an aggregation of star (?) performers I sincerely hope will never again&#8212;no never be thrust upon an Omaha audience.  I hope the exposition management will have this band in attendance at the Indian convention, for there it will be in its sphere&#8212;glory as it were playing the lovely accompaniments to the Ghost, Sanke and other dances so charmingly musical to the intelligent Caucassian race.</p>

                            <head type="sub">The Musical Critic has the largest circulation of any Musical Newspaper in the South and West.</head>
                            <p>The Omaha World-Herald laboriously attempts to reply to the editorial in the issue of THE MUSICAL CRITIC.  What purports to be a letter from the "executive officers" reads like a Miss Julia Officer effusion, is the substance of the "reply".  After virtually admitting the truth of every charge made the THE MUSICAL CRITIC, the letter justifies Miss Officer in her business methods, and names the very best singers heard in Omaha as representative of the entire list of artists.  "If Miss Officer merely acted as go-between or agent, and afterward the engagement depended upon the musical director, there was nothing wrong with the business," says the World-Herald.  That is just the point.  Miss Officer did not represent herself to artists as an agent or manager for the artists, but as a department manager of the exposition, authorized to engage artists.  Had Miss Officer offered her services as agent as musicians, she would have been entitled to a commission on all business secured through her efforts; but instead, she selected, so far as she could, those vocalists who seemed "easy marks," engaging but a few of the best for reasons quite obvious.  The purchasing agent of a railway or manufacturing corporation is not expected to demand commissions on goods bought, in lieu of a salary, and the experience of the Omaha exposition bureau of music demonstrates that the best artistic results are not obtained by means discountenanced by ably managed commercial enterprises.</p>
                            <p>The columns of THE MUSICAL CRITIC prove that Messrs. Hamlin, Clark and Cowper, Misses Wilson, Buckley, Osborne, and Fisk are not regarded as musical nonentities, but THE MUSICAL CRITIC reiterates with all the vehemence of conviction that musical nonentities predominated in the vocal "festivities" at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>For the benefit of Miss Officer or whoever wrote the letter mentioned, it may be said that the editorial writing and the editing of correspondence on THE MUSICAL CRITIC are done by different men; the editorial writer has not read the correspondence, either in manuscript or type, hence his ignorance of the contents of the correspondence is more excusable than is Miss Officer's courtesy (?) to artists who enclose stamps for replies that never come.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Famous Apache Terror Heads a Long Procession of Warriors.</head>
                            <p>Travelers who happened to be at the Union station yesterday noon were treated to a novel sight.  The noon express from the west on the Rock Island conveyed a camp of American Indians, fresh from the tepees and lodges of the Fort Sill military reservation.  The exposition was their destination.  There were Cheyennes, Arapahoes and Wichitas, Apaches, Kiowas and Chiricahuas and for two hours they bivouacked in true Indian fashion on the station platform while their accoutrements were being loaded on wagons and carted away.  There were copper-skins representing every degree and condition of Indian life, every stage of civilization, from the erudite John Smith, attired in a worn but up-to-date frock coat, who teaches in the government schools, down to old Geronimo, the grizzled old terror of the whole southwest, garbed in beaded buckskin, grotesque blankets, feathers and warpaint.  They jabbered and grinned and kept sharp lookout to see that none of the crowd stole their trappings for keepsakes, while several hundred spectators looked on with interest.</p>
                            <p>There were 125 of them all told.  Six are enlisted government scouts, twenty-two are prisoners of war under the old warrior chief Geronimo and the rest are just plain Indians who live on Uncle Sam's reservations and draw rations.  Squaws attired in blankets, which for bright colors surpass imagination, their long jet black hair braided with variegated ribbons, crooning papooses strapped to their backs and braves blanketed and greasy.  The men wore beaded moccasins, tin bracelets and hair braided and tied with beaver tails.  Miniature tomahawks hung in their ears and their bronze colored skin was almost concealed by brilliant paint.  The bucks smoked pipes and jabbered.  The squaws stood in groups and looked on.</p>
                            <p>The enlisted scouts in the party are Toclani, Perico, Ranamo, John Loco and Apache.  Lieutenant Thompson of Fort Sill, I. T., is detailed to look after them.  The rest of the outfit, including fifty-one ponies, is in charge of James Mooney, who was sent by the Department of the Interior.  G. W. Gaines, commissary of the Indian department at the exposition, met the party and conducted them to their quarters at the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The Apaches got to the grounds just in time to witness the sham battle, and during the affray they were Captain Mercer's guests, occupying seats on the high portico that has been erected just inside the fence.  In addition to Geronimo, Natchee is in the party.  This Indian is Geronimo's head man, and is said to have had more to do with the raids against the whites than the old man himself.  Geronimo is 63 years of age and as straight as an arrow.  He is of medium height and quite heavy.  He does not speak English, though he understands considerable of the language.  He is a chronic grumbler, and this was decidedly noticeable yesterday.  Immediately after arriving in camp, he commenced finding fault because tents had not been erected before he and his party came.  Then he grumbled because dinner had not been prepared and was awaiting his arrival.</p>
                            <p>Tents for the Apaches have been erected east of those occupied by the Assiniboines, on the north side of the grounds, where they will go into camp.  Most of the Apaches are good looking people.  Their women are not beauties, but they are much better looking than their northern sisters.  They, as well as the men, are small, much smaller than the Indians residing in the northern states.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Representatives of institutions and organizations engaged in the uplifting of humanity arrived in the city yesterday and today to attend the Transmississippi Conference of Charities and Corrections.  The sessions will open tonight at the First Congregational church and during the five days following there will be discussions by the leading workers in charitable lines in the country.  The delegations are not confined to the transmississppi territory as workers will be in attendance from New York, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.  The general purpose of the conference is for the interchange of ideas among men who have accomplished results in the comparatively new field of scientific charitable and correctional work.  It is expected that the discussions will furnish more accurate information to the interested public than any number of text books on sociology because of the specialized experience back of them.</p>
                            <p>The fact is also dwelt upon that the conference will be entirely free from any denominational leaning and that the only motive of its members will be the good of their fellow men.  The program has been arranged with this thought in mind and at the opening session tonight the program will be divided among a varied number of protestant denominations with representations also from the Jewish and Catholic churches.</p>

                            <p>The discussions will be upon subjects of a charitable, correctional and philanthropic nature, although the latter branch is not formally represented by delegates.  The charitable phase will occupy a large amount of attention and the most approved methods of lending aid to the needy will be brought out.  Under this department will come the meetings of the State Boards of Charities to compare notes regarding the administration of state institutions, representatives of private institutions for charitable work and also those appointed by governors of states and mayors of cities for purposes of official research.  One of the principal speakers on charity organizations will be S. N. Rosenau, formerly of Omaha and now at the head of the Hebrew benevolent organizations of New York.  Such local relief associations as the Creche, Associated Charities, the Omaha City Mission, the Child Saving Institute, St. James Orphanage, the Women's Christian association, the Young Men's Hebrew Benevolent society and the Visiting Nurses' association will also be represented.</p>
                            <p>Under the head of corrections, industrial school work and prison conditions will be commented on by those whose life work has been among those surroundings.  The subjects of jail and work houses will be presented by General R. Brinkerhoff of the State Board of Charities of Ohio.  Prison methods will be spoken of by Prof. C. R. Henderson of the Chicago University and life in state reformatories will be explained by W. C. Kilvington, Nashville, Tenn.; Dr. W. A. Hale, Dayton, O.; and C. W. Hoxie, Kearney, Neb.  The child saving problem will be discussed under the head of philanthropic work and the social settlement movement will also be spoken of by those who have been personally concerned in such experiments.</p>

                            <p>The session tonight will be in the form of an opening reception and welcoming addresses will be given by Governor Holcomb, president of the State Conference of Charities and Corrections under whose auspices the convention is held, Mayor Moores and the clergy of the city.  The morning session tomorrow will be in the hands of state boards of charities and the afternoon will be divided between a discussion of charity organizations and a reception at the Lininger art gallery from 4 to 6 o'clock, which is tendered to delegates with the usual hospitality of its owner.  The regular sessions have been planned so that the visitors will have their afternoons free to visit the exposition.  On Sunday the pulpits of the city will be largely filled by clergymen in attendance at the conference.</p>
                            <p>The committee in charge of the reception of guests is made up of Prof. Gillespie, G. W. Lininger, Thomas Kilpatrick, Mrs. Frances Ford and Rev. John Williams.  The committee has arranged for the entertainment of 300 accredited delegates and it is expected that many more will attend from out of the city out of personal interest.  The details of the conference are in the hands of Rev. A. W. Clark, John Laughland and John Hebard.</p>
                            <p>Among the delegates who arrived this morning are:  Dr. D. O. Gardner, trustee Cleveland State hospital, Cleveland, O.; General R. Brinkerhoff, chairman Society Board of State Charities, Mansfield, O.; Joseph P. Byers, secretary State Board of Charities, New York; James F. Jackson, secretary State Board of Charities, Minnesota; C. E. Faulkner, Washburn Home, Minneapolis, Minn.; W. B. Sherrard, Children's Home society, Sioux Falls, S. D.</p>

                            <head type="sub">A Few Facts for an Art Critic Study.</head>
                            <p>It may be interesting for the Omaha "Art Critic" who knows so little of artists and art and yet who presumes to know so much as to be able to tear to pieces such a great work of art as "Trilby," is to learn something of the artist who painted the picture.  Usually it is unnecessary to say much about the artist, as he is so well known throughout the country, but the "Omaha Critic" has evidently not been away from home for some time, and therefore has not visited the art centers where Cooper is known.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Astney D. M. Cooper is an American by birth.  He was born in St. Louis, Mo.  He went to Paris when 12 years of age and studied under the best masters.  Bougereau and the late Jules Tavineir were among his tutors.  When he returned to this country he was appointed sketch artist on Frank Leslie's Weekly and was sent out with General Custer in the late Indian war (in which Custer was killed), in that capacity.  At the close of the war he painted "Custer's Last Stand," a picture that created universal interest.  He moved to California, and from his studio in San Jose has sent out many pictures that have brought him fame.  Among those may be mentioned "Cleopatra's Barge," owned by M. H. DeYoung, editor and proprietor of the San Francisco Chronicle.  Mrs. Charles Crocker of the Crocker Art gallery, Sacramento, owns the painting "She."  "The Morning of the Crucifixion" is another of his remarkable productions, and for six years past has been exhibited throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico, with wonderful success.  "Flora" is now the property of C. D. Perry of London, England, and many others have been placed in galleries or private collections throughout the country.  Fair and honest critics give Cooper the credit of being one of the greatest figure painters of the age.  He studied surgery in the St. Louis Medical college, and has a thorough knowledge of anatomy, which he has used to wonderful advantage in his figure productions.</p>
                            <p>"Trilby" has been exhibited for three years throughout the country.  Columns of highly complimentary notices have been written about it by competent critics, and it has always been largely patronized wherever shown.  So much for the artist, and it is surprising that one who aspires to be a critic should not know about him.  As for the critic, she ruthlessly tears to pieces anything that does not suit her aesthetic taste.  She must have some strong influence exerted over her to get so far out of her domain as to write up the "Midway attractions" when she was supposed to write about art at the art gallery, and the complimentary reference to another picture on the Midway shows that there must have been some other motive behind the article than just criticism.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The conclusion of the arguments in police court yesterday evening in the case wherein James Lindsey is accused of having fired five shots at Sergeant Carter of the exposition guards was marked by a "bit of a go" between Attorney W. B. Ten Eyck for the prosecution and Charles E. Fanning, guide, instructor and adviser of the outlawed fire and police board, who posed as bondsman and friend of Lindsey.</p>
                            <p>Fanning, who evidently did not anticipate that Ten Eyck, who is a slight, slim-built young man, would resent his threatening move toward him, was altogether unprepared for the telling blow that struck him in the mouth and sent him reeling backwards and Ten Eyck did not give him a chance to prepare himself for defense.  He saw he had Fanning "going" in the language of the prize ring, and rained blow after blow on the latter's face.  Fanning at no time had an opportunity of defending himself and simply <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            
                            <pb n="176" xml:id="TMISB06-176"/>
                            
                            <p>He finally backed up against a heavy bench with Ten Eyck at him hammer and tongs.  Just as the court officers and Captain Sigwart rushed forward to separate the men the bench toppled over, carrying Fanning and Ten Eyck with it.  Fanning struck on his back with Ten Eyck, still fighting, on top of him.  Before the latter could inflict much damage to Fanning several officers separated the two and whisked Ten Eyck to the prisoners' enclosure on the jail floor.  Here he was booked as "W. B. Jones."  While giving his name he was called before Judge Gordon, where Assistant County Attorney Herring was waiting to sign a bond for him.  This, however, was not necessary, as no complaint was entered against him and he was released.</p>
                            <p>After the men had been separated Fanning did not utter a word in the court room, but his livid face showed the passion that was boiling within him.</p>
                            <p>He followed Ten Eyck to the jailer's enclosure and through the wire netting hissed between his teeth:  "You took advantage of me in the court room, but I'll wait for you on the outside and we'll see who's the best man."  While Ten Eyck was answering the customary questions of the jailer Fanning passed upstairs into the court room and was on his way up town with several friends when Ten Eyck was released.</p>
                            <p>The fight caused the greatest sort of excitement among the court officers and spectators and for a while it was thought that the friends of both men would mix things.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">How it All <choice><sic>Begun</sic><corr>Began</corr></choice>.</head>
                            <p>The cause of the fight was the several caustic references Ten Eyck made toward Fanning during the course of his argument.  He designated Fanning as the "backbone" of the Fire and Police board; the "dominating factor" in the defense of Lindsey and a man who could use the power he had in influencing the police in Lindsey's behalf.  Ten Eyck, when the case against Lindsey was called, took exception to the statement the latter had made that the gun he had fired at Carter was loaded with blank cartridges and accused someone interested in the case with having substituted empty blank cartridge shells for the ball cartridge shells that were in the weapon when it was given to the police.  He intimated in his argument that someone who was either identified with the police department or who had influence with it had made the substitution.</p>
                            <p>It was at this point of his argument that he insinuated that Fanning might have known something about the matter.  Fanning did not relish those shots and glared wickedly at Ten Eyck.  At the time he occupied a seat next to Lindsey and would occasionally confer with him and his attorney in a whisper.  Just before the arguments were concluded he moved to a seat in the rear of the room, where he watched Ten Eyck intently.  When the latter got ready to leave Fanning left his seat hurriedly and advanced toward him.  He passed out of the gate of the railing near the judge's desk just in advance of Ten Eyck.  When the gate had closed behind them he turned deliberately about and called Ten Eyck a vile name.  The words had hardly left his mouth before Ten Eyck's fist was planted squarely on his lower jaw and the first was on.</p>
                            <p>In the Lindsey case his honor reserved his decision until Saturday.  Judging from the remarks made by the attorney for the defense, the final conclusion of the case will be followed by a civil suit for damages against the exposition officials and the possible arrest of Sergeant Carter for assault.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AN IMPORTANT GATHERING.</head>
                            <p>The national convention of veterinary surgeons, held in Omaha last week, represented a branch of science which is today commanding more attention from the general public than at any past period in the history of our country.  The demand for veterinary skill is <choice><sic>plainily</sic><corr>plainly</corr></choice> on the increase, not only along the common lines of animal surgery and veterinary practice, but in the higher branches and calling of the work; in the inspection of meats as food products, in the investigation and quarantine regulation of contagious animal diseases, in the experimentation and operations for complicated ailments and defects.</p>
                            <p>The progress that veterinary science has made in recent years shows that this branch of learning and skill has not been neglected, but earnestly and persistently pushed forward, as rapidly as conditions would permit.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of any provision for a state veterinarian in our state, Nebraska did not show up at this convention with the degree of enterprise and credit that a great stock growing and stock feeding state like Nebraska merits.  A state veterinarian to guard the health conditions of the domestic animals of a state is recognized as an imperative need, a necessity that cannot be overlooked.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska has within the past few years had a number of scares, where strange and mysterious ailments have appeared in herds, and in many instances serious loss has resulted.  There being no state authority to apply to, who can give immediate attention, and the skill of local talent exhausted without benefit or relief, the stock owner feels helpless and neighbors are anxious for fear of an outbreak of a contagious and destructive disease.</p>
                            <p>The feeling of security to stock owners in the state would more than compensate for the cost of a state veterinarian, to say nothing of the actual security that must result from having a competent, skillful veterinarian to guard the health of our great stock industry.</p>
                            <p>The national convention illustrated, through its clinics, that many so-called incurable diseases or ailments have yielded to the skill of veterinary surgery.  The defect called "roaring," often known as "windbroken," in horses, was removed by an operation.  Many other delicate operations were performed, with success, which restored worthless animals to their once valuable condition.</p>
                            <p>The congregating in Omaha of such a learned body of men in veterinary science should influence toward better conditions in Nebraska in the interest of the stock  raiser and stock owner.</p>
                            <p>The interest in the national currency convention, held at the Nebraska building, exposition grounds, was well shown yesterday, the building being filled with prominent men before 10 o'clock, the opening hour.</p>
                            <p>Chairman J. Sterling Morton announced a slight change in the program, and that Judge M. L Crawford of Dallas, Tex., one of the gold standard speakers who had not arrived in time to speak Tuesday, would be given twenty-five minutes, after which Charles A. Towne would speak.  After this Mr. Towne would take the chair and "Silver Day" would begin.</p>
                            <p>"Men were infinitely more devoted to the interests of their country in 1834, when Andrew Jackson was president and Thomas H. Benton was in the senate, than they are today," was the only statement which might be called new or original made by Judge Crawford.</p>
                            <p>The authority for and proof of this statement offered by Judge Crawford was a recent magazine article which states that in Jackson's time the incidental expenses of a senator or congressman were $900 per year, while they were at present $9,000 per year.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the above statement Judge Crawford's speech was made up of historical extracts and references familiar to all single gold standard and bimetallic advocates who have been readers or hearers of speech during the past few years.  Judge Crawford followed the regulation gold standard advocate policy of ignoring the changes which have taken place since Jefferson wrote and Jackson acted, when to do so would apparently strengthen his contention that the single gold standard was the only possible or right standard.</p>
                            <p>It was also impossible, apparently, for Judge Crawford to understand how it was possible for the value of gold measured in commodities to decrease, and for the value of silver, measured in commodities, to increase, and for the relative value of the two to reach the ratio of 16 to 1.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Mr. Towne took occasion to correct Judge Crawford's misquoting of his (Towne's) speech Tuesday, and Judge Crawford was also corrected on this point by gentlemen in the audience, but he declined to correct his misquoting of Mr. Bryan and Mr. Towne, or to admit that there was any other way to measure the value of gold or silver than by the present price of gold, as measured by the English pound <choice><sic>stering</sic><corr>sterling</corr></choice>.  Judge Crawford incidentally became tangled up and using "price" and "value" as equivalents.  He declared before closing that "if free coinage of silver is adopted gold will leave this country in shiploads," but did not say what, if anything would come back in return for the gold, providing the "shiploads" of gold did leave the country.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TOWNE WARMLY GREETED.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Towne received a very warm greeting when presented by Chairman Morton.  After thanking the audience and speaking of the good feeling manifested by both audience and speakers he called on Senator Allen to preside while he was speaking.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">SENATOR ALLEN AS A HOST.</head>
                            <p>Senator Allen said he had been invited to speak at the convention, but as it was held during the great exposition in the state which he in part represented he had considered that he should act in the capacity of host rather than as a visitor, and as such it was his place to sit silent and let the visitors speak.  In the capacity of host Senator Allen said the people of Nebraska's broad prairies, who were broad and liberal in their views, welcomed heartily to the state and city the National Currency convention.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">CORRECTS MISQUOTATIONS.</head>
                            <p>Only because his name had been referred to by a speaker from New York, (Horace White) and his statements regarding the issue of bonds by the Cleveland administration had been misquoted would he, Senator Allen, say a few words.  He would repeat, he said, his statements that the issue of bonds was unauthorized, and no lawyer who did not court the reputation of a pettifogger would say that the law referred to by him, White, and on which the issue of bonds was based, authorized such an issue.  But Mr. White had not read his (Allen's) speech in the senate far enough to do him justice, and had not quoted where he said that the American people were just and honest and that they would not take advantage of any technicality but would pay interest and principal of the bonds, having received value for them.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">COULDN'T HELP APPLAUDING.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Towne was obliged to ask that he be not interrupted, or his time for speaking lessened by applause, to which a voice in the audience replied:</p>
                            <p>"We can't help it."</p>
                            <p>The speakers on the other side were complimented for one thing.  They had come out fairly and squarely for the single gold standard, which simplified the question, and was better and more honorable than the position occupied by gold standard men in the campaign of 1896, when they masqueraded under the guise of friends of silver and bimetallists.</p>

                            <head type="sub">RESPECTS TO EHRICHS.</head>
                            <p>Referring to Mr. Ehrichs' declaration on Tuesday, which was the only one made by any one of the gold standard speakers on the subject&#8212;that the quantitative theory of money was incorrect and fallacious, and that quantity did not control the value of money&#8212;Mr. Towne said that the silver side would insist, even to the point of discourtesy, on an answer to the plain question as to what did constitute and control the value of money.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">THINKERS IN GOLD.</head>
                            <p>One trouble with the advocates of the single gold standard.  Mr. Towne said was that they were "thinkers in gold," and lost sight of, and could not think in, commodities.</p>
                            <p>The English apostle of single gold standardism had declared that the farmers wanted a dollar of the highest purchasing power.  The American advocates of the single gold standard, including the gold speakers at this convention, had adopted the decl<unclear reason="torn"/>
                            
                            <pb n="177" xml:id="TMISB06-177"/>
                            
                            as their law and repeated it and re-repeated it.  But nothing was said about the farmer having to give more and more of his own products for this dollar of higher purchasing power.  That the man who had money and wanted things should want a dollar of the highest purchasing power he could understand, Mr. Towne said, but that the seven-eighths of the population which had things, and only things, to trade for dollars, should want a dollar of the highest purchasing power, for which they would have to give the greatest quantity of things, was inconceivable.</p>
                            <p>Not the faintest conception of the average range of prices had been shown by any of the gold standard speakers, and would not, Mr. Towne said, be shown by them.  They had simply picked out special cases of the rise or fall of price of specific articles, but the general range of prices of all commodities seemed to be inconceivable to them.  This fall in average prices had been disastrous to all except the possessors of money, and the increasing purchasing power of money had stifled new enterprises and industry.</p>
                            <p>Horace White, in his gold standard speech on Tuesday, had unintentionally and unconsciously made one of the strongest possible arraignments of the single standard.  He had told of the millions upon millions of idle money in the New York banks.  This money, Mr. Towne declared, should be out and at work, but the single gold standard drove it into idleness in the banks.  It would be as sensible for Mr. White, during the strike of 1894, to point to the miles on miles of idle engines and cars in the railroad yards in Chicago as an evidence of the transportation importance and prosperity of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Towne's speech will appear in full in the World-Herald of Friday evening and Saturday morning.</p>
                            <p>Ex-United States Senator J. M. Carey of Wyoming, who was on the program for an address Tuesday afternoon, "The Gold Standard, From the Standpoint of the Western States," in defense of the single gold standard, was introduced at 12:40.</p>
                            <p>The west, as divided off from the rest of the United States by Mr. Carey, had never experienced a bimetallic standard.  California and Oregon has maintained the gold standard during the entire time of the civil war, and the wonderful progress had been made under either a paper or a single gold standard.  The best money for the Kansas farmer or the Colorado miner was that which was best for the New York business man, Mr. Carey said, and he then argued that such money was gold, principally on account of the alleged stability in the value of gold.  The speaker had at one time believed that bimetallism might be possible through an international agreement, but from the progress which the gold standard had made in recent years he was satisfied that bimetallism was a thing of the past and that gold would be the single standard of the world.</p>
                            <p>It would have been better for this country, Mr. Carey declared, if the silver which has been coined into dollars during the last twenty years had remained uncoined; as it had to be measured and redeemed in gold it would be as well to have greenbacks in place of silver dollars.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">CAREY CONDUCTS FUNERAL.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Carey declared his belief that if Henry M. Teller or W. J. Bryan had been president they would have acted as Cleveland and Harrison acted, and "preserving the honor of the country and the gold standard, resorting to all necessary expedients to do so."  Then Mr. Carey proceeded to bury free silver coinage and deliver a funeral oration over the grave, when he was asked a few questions by ex-Senator Dubois of Idaho.  Mr. Dubois told of the action of the republican state convention of Utah declaring for the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting for the consent of any other nation, notwithstanding the letter from Mark Hanna instructing the convention not to take such action.</p>
                            <p>In reply to Mr. Dubois' questions Mr. Carey declared that the Utah republicans were not republicans because they did not believe in the single gold standard, and in answer to a further question he declared that he would rather see a democrat elected to the United States congress or to congress than a free silver republican.</p>

                            <p>The Oklahoma day exercises in the Auditorium were preceded by the usual concert by the Omaha Concert band, and by the time the official party arrived the building contained an audience of fair proportions.  The visitors were headed by the First Regiment band of Guthrie and escorted by a troop of mounted Indians in charge of Captain Mercer.  The Indians dropped out of line when they reached the grounds and went on to their encampment, but the band was escorted to a position on the platform, from which it contributed some excellent music during the program.  Half a dozen members of Colonel Roosevelt's troop of Rough Riders, who accompanied the Oklahoma party, were also invited to seats on the stage, and their appearance was followed by vigorous applause.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles <choice><sic>begun</sic><corr>began</corr></choice> the proceedings by giving a very graceful greeting to the Oklahoma visitors.  He said the enterprise and prosperity of their state are effectively illustrated by its handsome exhibit on the grounds and the large number of its citizens who have come to celebrate this occasion.  Oklahoma has always given to the exposition that hearty co-operation and support that has made it possible to successfully carry on such an enterprise.  He alluded to the rapid transformation of the territory that has occurred within a very few years.  Cities had grown up in a night, order has been secured from chaos, schools and colleges have been established, churches built and railroads constructed.  From an almost savage territory it has become a promising candidate for statehood, with a population of 350,000 and an annual production of over $25,000,000.  That its participation in this exposition will be followed by great results is not to be doubted.</p>

                            <p>In response to President Wattles, Governor Barnes declared that nothing was more grateful than a generous and warmhearted welcome to people who are entering a domain to which most of them are strangers.  It has made them feel at home at the beginning of their visit and they propose to see the whole show if they have to stay all summer.</p>
                            <p>Continuing, Governor Barnes eulogized Oklahoma as the happy medium between the frozen north and the raw climate of the gulf.  There roses bloom in December and the chilly breezes that swept down from the north are always tempered by the bright sunshine of the south.  In nine years its people have acquired all the features of an advanced commonwealth.  The settlement and development of Oklahoma furnishes the most wonderful story that history has ever recorded.  Its progress has been backed by no capital except that of sturdy hands and honest, hopeful hearts.  In thirty days after the territory was opened to settlement it had done what other states had taken years to accomplish.</p>
                            <p>After a musical interlude by the First Regiment band, President Wattles introduced J. C. Robberts of Kingfisher, who spoke at some length.  He declared it gave him more than ordinary pleasure to participate in this occasion.  In Nebraska he had begun to fight the real battles of life.  Here his children had been born, and on its fertile prairies he had learned the best lessons of his life.  But now he came to speak of a commonwealth that is without an equal.  This served as an introduction to an exhaustive narration of the history of the territory now known as Oklahoma and of its wonderful resources and progress.  This was portrayed in a manner that commanded the undivided interest of the audience and the speaker was frequently interrupted by applause.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Robberts' address was followed by an equally interesting effort by Major E. A. Woodson, who was also an enthusiastic boomer of Oklahoma interests.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MEXICO'S FOURTH OF JULY EVENT.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Anniversary of the Republic's Independence Fittingly Observed.</head>
                            <p>Yesterday was the eighty-seventh anniversary of the independence of the Mexican republic, and to properly observe the occasion Albino R. Nuncio, the Mexican commissioner to the exposition, and the members of the Mexican band felt that they were entitled to a holiday.  During the day they distributed Mexican badges of tri-colored ribbon, green, white and red, the national colors of the republic.  With these there were <choice><sic>medalion</sic><corr>medallion</corr></choice> photographs of President Diaz.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday morning the leader of the Mexican band announced that at the evening concert on the Plaza he would change the musical program to some extent if it was agreeable to the exposition management.  The consent was given and one of the prettiest programs was carried out and was listened to by an audience of several thousands.  The Mexican airs were played and then the band rendered "Yankee Doodle" and "Dixie," after which there were more of the Mexican tunes, the concert closing with the Mexican National hymn, which was played, the members of the band rising to their feet and remaining uncovered.  The audience seemed to catch the inspiration and as the sounds of the music floated out on the night air, everybody arose, the men doffing their hats.  As the sound of the last note died away the piece was loudly cheered.</p>
                            <p>Immediately after the concert President Wattles and the members of the executive committee of the exposition invited Commissioner Nuncio and the members of the band to Markel's cafe, where an elaborate banquet was spread.  After the menu had been discussed President Wattles, who occupied the post of honor at the table, spoke of the rapid advances made by the republic to the south of the United States and assured the commissioner that the people of this country felt a great interest in its future and were glad to see it make such rapid strides.  He referred to President Diaz as one of the greatest lights of the century and denominated him as a man without a peer.  He said that a bond of friendship bound the two great republics together and as evidence of this he referred to the course pursued by the Mexican government during the recent war with Spain, when in a measure it espoused the cause of the United States.  The Mexicans, he said, had been friends of the Americans for years and their trade relations were such that they were much like the people of one great country, all having interest identical and in common.</p>
                            <p>Commission Nuncio responded, saying that the friendly feeling in Mexico toward the United States and its people had been growing for years.  The Americans had invested their money in Mexico and had done much to develop the country.  He assured the members of the committee that their kindness in giving the banquet was highly appreciated and before sitting down he invited them to a banquet that the Mexicans will spread in honor of the birthday anniversary of President Diaz.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Remarkably Rich Rock Shown from the Extreme Northwest State.</head>
                            <p>The last space that remained in the Mines and Mining building has been filled with a very creditable exhibit from Washington.  This exhibit was secured at the expense of unusual effort and this is responsible for the delay in its appearance.  No state appropriation was available to defray the cost of collecting and installing the material and L. K. Armstrong and other Washington citizens who have furnished the display have had a very uphill road to travel.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="178" xml:id="TMISB06-178"/>
                            
                            <p><unclear reason="cut off"/> very favorably with other features of the building and indicates very fully the varied mineral resources of the state.  Very few exhibits are able to show so many different types of mineral formation as are seen in the Washington contribution and it also includes a number of extremely rich and unique specimens.</p>
                            <p>The display of ores is largely confined to gold, silver, copper and lead and most of the specimens contain two or more of these minerals in greater or less proportions.  The gold ores depend very largely on an iron or copper base and the free milling ores are comparatively infrequent.  This is charged by metallurgists to the heavy precipitation of that section, which prevents any great amount of oxidation and brings the refractory ores almost to the surface.</p>
                            <p>Among the free milling ores there is one display that is a decided novelty.  The <choice><sic>quatrz</sic><corr>quartz</corr></choice> is almost pure white and the specimens resemble chunks of chalk or pure limestone.  The particles of gold are entirely invisible and even old miners are surprised when they are told that this ore runs from forty to 800 ounces to the ton.  The deposit from which these specimens are taken were discovered in 1894 and have only been worked during the last three years.</p>
                            <p>Silver is found in all the lead ores in Washington and what is displayed as silver ore is practically lead ore in which the proportion of silver exceeds that of the other constituents.  Some of the combinations of these two metals are <choice><sic>wondeurflly</sic><corr>wonderfully</corr></choice> rich and there are two specimens in the exhibit which are worth $50 each.  The lowest lead ore runs from 35 to 40 per cent lead and is also made profitable by an almost equal proportion of iron in carbonates.  One of the most striking specimens is a huge boulder which represents a formation that runs from 500 to 1,100 ounces in silver.</p>
                            <p>Some specimens of slate and ornamental stone are also shown, but these deposits have not been fully developed on account of the absence of a market.  A great deal of gold ore is also barred from commercial value on account of the extreme cost of transportation to the smelters.  Under present conditions mines cannot be profitably worked that run less than from $12 to $15 a ton, but there are vast deposits of $10 ore in the state that are expected to become profitable during the next generation.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DANCE GOES ON JUST THE SAME.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Indians Put Ginger Into Their Efforts and Have a Good Time.</head>
                            <p>The dance at the Indian village drew an unusually large crowd last night.  One of the most interested spectators was Chief Geronimo of the Apaches.  The dance was the regulation affair, such as is danced just before the warriors start out on a hair-raising excursion, or rather, such as they danced some thirty or forty years ago.</p>
                            <p>Having lived in the south during the whole of his life, Geronimo had never seen anything of the kind before and the sight of a couple of hundred half naked Indians, painted and decorated with feathers, was something of a revelation to the old man, who has discarded the blanket and has put on the uniform of a cavalry scout.  As the Indians danced and kept time to the music pounded out of a drum, the old man smiled and whispered to his lieutenant, Natches, that it must be great fun.  He even intimated that if he was not wearing heavy cavalry boots, he might try the step himself.</p>
                            <p>It was the same old dance that has been seen at the Indian village a score of times, but it was full of ginger and noise and that pleased everybody immensely.  Even some of the southern Indians, who are not much on dances, said that they had a great notion to try the step, just to get the experience.  One young woman who has Indian blood flowing through her veins, but who is highly educated and has taught in the Indian schools, said:  "I have not seen one of these dances since I was a child, but the sound of the old familiar drum and the doleful songs of the Indians makes me feel as though I would like to go into the ring and dance, but I guess that I will not."</p>
                            <p>Continuing, she said:  "It is natural for an Indian to dance.  They all like it.  They all like music and are good musicians, so far as keeping time is concerned, but they know nothing of harmony, simply because they have not been taught even the rudiments of music."</p>

                            <p>The preparations for the Peace Jubilee have partially eclipsed those for Government day, which occurs next Tuesday.  This will not in any way conflict with the demonstration in October, but it is the occasion of the formal reception of the committee of United States senators that was appointed by Vice President Hobart during the last session of congress to visit the exposition.  The committee includes Senators Thurston, Warren, Gear, Nelson, Mason, Wolcott, <unclear reason="torn"/> Arkansas, Pettigrew, Cannon, Harris and Heitfeld.  President Wattles has received assurances from nearly all these gentlemen that they will be present and a number of additional members of both houses have also accepted the invitations of the exposition management to accompany the senatorial committee.  There will be exercises in the Auditorium in the morning, at which a number of the senators will deliver addresses and these will be followed by a lunch at Markel's cafe, where those who did not speak in the Auditorium will respond to toasts.  A special program, which will probably include a sham battle by the Indians and an appropriate display of fireworks, will be arranged for the remainder of the day.</p>

The entries have closed with 1,000 hogs, 800 cattle, 500 sheep and 300 horses.  Aside from the horses, the entries are much more numerous than at the World's fair, while the indications are that the stock will be of a much better quality.  Stock that is to be exhibited will be received between October 1 and 6, but no animal will be received after the last named date.  The show proper begins on October 3.</p>
                            <p>Barns for housing the animals that will come to the live stock show have been about completed.  As many workmen as can labor to advantage are employed.

                            <p>Everything around the Indian camp was stir and activity yesterday, the time being occupied in making changes in connection with the location of a number of the tribes.  The Apaches and other Indians from Indian Territory were allowed to pitch their tents east of the office buildings and on the north side of the lot.  The Assiniboines were moved east of their old location, while the Apaches from New Mexico were taken out of the center of the lot and located on the north side, close to Geronimo and the members of the band.  The gate on the north side of the Apiary building was closed and one opened in the rear of the Dairy building, thus permitted the entire portion of the grounds on the north to be used as a camp.</p>

The rate that has been secured is equal to 1 cent a mile and the tickets will be sold October 8 and 9 and be good for the return trip until October 24 and 26.</p>
                            <p>The exposition management has made the usual reduction to 15 cents for children for Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs Children's day which occurs tomorrow.  Similar concessions have been made by most of the Midway resorts, and the children will be able to see a good deal of the show at a very slight expense.  Miss Anna Foos of Omaha, Mrs. E. B. Towl of South Omaha and Mrs. S. C. Keys of Council Bluffs have been designated as a committee to look after the children.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The opening session of the Transmississippi Conference of Charities and Correction was held last evening in the First Congregational church.  The meetings which will be held in this city during the next five days are under the auspices of the National Conference of Charities and Correction and will take the place of the annual state conference which was to have been held at this time.  Representatives are present not only from the transmississippi territory but also from several of the eastern states, who come, as they say, to learn the systems and methods of the western conferences and to gain ideas from workers in a comparatively new field.</p>
                            <p>The session last evening was well attended and took the form of a reception to the visiting delegates, with addresses of welcome by the leading divines of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of Governor Holcomb, who is president of the Nebraska States conference, the vice president, Rev. Campbell Fair, occupied the chair.  Divine blessing was invoked by Bishop Worthington.  Then followed a short message of welcome from Mayor Frank E. Moores, read by his private secretary, as the mayor was scheduled for three addresses of welcome last evening.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Welcomes to the City.</head>
                            <p>The first address of welcome from the pulpit of Omaha was delivered by Rev. Dr. S. Wright Butler.  He referred to the conventions that are now being held in this city and dwelt upon the thought that among them all, coming with the enthusiasm of competing excellences and aiming always at perfection, none impressed him so much as this conference meeting to discuss not perfection, but defection&#8212;not merit, but misfortune.  And yet it did not seem to him that the delegates looked morbid or abnormal.  They were neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but they take things as they come and despair of nothing.  He would call them amelioratists.</p>
                            <p>Rev. W. W. Harsha welcomed the delegates in behalf of twelve Presbyterian churches of this city, and in behalf of the great cause of humanity which they represent.  But he said that he sympathized with the work not only because of the brotherhood of man which the conference symbolizes, but also because if was Christ's teaching, and God had placed it in their hands to do.</p>
                            <p>Rabbi Leo M. Franklin spoke in behalf of the Jewish church.  He said that there seemed to be a special fitness that the Jew as a Jew should join in welcoming men and women who have left their homes to discuss the questions which a Jew first attempted to solve.  It was a Jew, too, who first conceived that generous thought that the prunings of the trees and the gleanings of the fields should not be gathered in, but left for the needy.  He was glad to be able to speak from a platform that recognizes neither sect nor creed and before a body of men and women who meet not in the name of any sectarian Savior or sectarian God, but in the name of that better religion which may be called humanity under God and aims to lift up the fallen rather than make long prayers and offer frequent libations.</p>
                            <p>The last address of welcome was delivered by Rev. Father McDevitt in behalf of the Roman Catholic churches of Omaha.  He expressed the desire that the conference might have the effect of uniting all Christian churches in the bond of charity and laid it <unclear reason="torn"/>there <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">Responses.</head>
                            <p>The first of the delegates to respond to the words of welcome was N. S. Rosenau of New York City.  He said the east had come to the west to learn from those who are not trammeled by old establishments and customs and can receive new ideas and put them into practice.  In referring to the National Conference of Charities he said that no resolution had ever been passed and no legislation made.  Questions have been discussed and settled without formal action.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosenau was followed by General R. Brinkerhoff of Ohio, who has been connected with the organization since its organization twenty years ago.  He gave a brief outline of the principles of the association and referred to his experiences in personal investigation of prisons, which he had made the subject of special study for many years.  He said that alms-giving was admitted to be an evil rather than a good.  Another principle which the conferences have developed, he said, is that after all that has been done, charity must go farther back and begin with the children.  The school systems must be changed.  He quoted statistics showing the enormous increase in the criminal class during the last forty years.</p>
                            <p>The session closed with a short address by Rev. Cyrus Mendenhall, prison chaplain at Ionia, Mich.</p>

                            <dateline>LEBANON, MISSOURI, THURSDAY <lb/> MORNING, SEPTEMBER 15.</dateline>
                            <p>Speaking of Mr. Nelson and family, their long sojourn at Omaha has been a very pleasant one and much credit is due Mr. and Mrs. Nelson for the conscientious manner in which they have attended their duties, making the Missouri fruit display one of the finest on the grounds.  Mrs. Nelson herself has taken particular pride in the arrangement of the fruits on spotless rows of plates and nothing but the magic touch of woman's band could give the Missouri fruits so dainty an appearance, and there are exclamations of praise from the crowds of visitors who pass through this fine exhibit every day.  The "A. Nelson Exhibit" is in itself very fine, indeed, and we looked at it with pride as a reminder that Laclede county is not behind other sections of the State in fruits and grains, but rather beats them all.</p>
                            <p>Frank Nelson is the pet of all exhibitors and knows every nook and corner and all the employes of the great Exposition, including Turks, Arabs, Chinamen and Indians.  He was as familiar with the "Streets of Cairo" and other Midway walks as Harwood avenue and the editor and wife and children were always sure of a good escort when Master Frank was along.</p>

                            <head type="sub">How Lumbermen's Day Was Celebrated at the Omaha Exposition.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>When the 9th of September was selected as Lumbermen's Day at the Omaha exposition, it was not anticipated that Jupiter Pluvius would be on hand to dispute the reign of the black cat, but it takes more than a rain storm to dampen the ardor of a lumberman, especially if he be a lumberman and a Hoo-Hoo, and therefore the 9th of September will be remembered by the lumber dealers and manufacturers who visited the Omaha exposition as a red letter day in the history of that industry in the west.</p>
                            <p>The various committees that had been appointed by the Nebraska lumbermen, who had in charge the entertainment of the day, met all trains coming to the city, and lumbermen visitors were immediately decorated with a distinguishing badge and made to understand that the freedom of the city and of the exposition grounds was theirs.  In addition to the special efforts that were made to entertain the visitors each one was furnished with a button and a card which stated <choice><sic>the</sic><corr>that</corr></choice> the lumbermen's button was "ace high" and entitled each to special rates on the Midway.  The committee had prepared a regular programme, which commenced with a meeting of the Nebraska lumbermen at the Nebraska building at 2 p. m.</p>
                            <p>At that hour Secretary J. C. Cleland, of the Nebraska Retailers <choice><sic>assocciation</sic><corr>association</corr></choice>, called the meeting to order and introduced President J. J. Bonekemper, who made an opening address in which he dwelt upon the work of the association, and urged every retail lumber dealer in the state of Nebraska, whether present or absent, to become a member.  In closing he called upon A. H. Weir, of Lincoln, Neb., who welcomed the visiting lumbermen in a few well chosen words, and turned over Midway and all the other attractions of the exposition for their amusement.  Following Mr. Weir, Mr. Bailey, of Missouri, talked interestingly on the benefits of the association.</p>
                            <p>John W. Barry, of Chicago, was the last speaker, and he addressed the audience in his usual happy vein, after which the meeting was closed, and the members adjourned to witness the log rolling contest in front of the government building at the west end of the lagoon.</p>

                            <head type="sub">The Log Rolling Contest.</head>
                            <p>The log rolling contest was decidedly the most interesting feature of the special attractions for the day, and especially so to those unfamiliar with the work of the loggers on the streams of the timber country.  Six husky young athletes from the northern woods dressed in tights, and wearing spiked shoes had entered for the contest.  There was a purse of $250, to be divided into four prizes of $100, $75, $50, $25 respectively.</p>
                            <p>The contestants were:</p>
                            <l>T. H. Fleming, Eau Claire, Wis.</l>
                            <l>A. R. Stewart, Eau Claire, Wis.</l>
                            <l>Gus Miller, Winona, Minn.</l>
                            <l>A. Dugas, Little Falls, Minn.</l>
                            <l>L. Cyer, Minneapolis.</l>
                            <l>John Murray, Eau Claire, Wis.</l>
                            <p>The rules which governed the contest were as follows:</p>
                            <p>Memorandum of conditions with expectation of six <choice><sic>ment o</sic><corr>men to</corr></choice> roll.</p>
                            <p>Three names to be put in each of 2 hats; one name to be drawn from each hat, and these two are to roll against each other; two other names to be drawn, one from each hat, and these are to be paired against each other; the two remaining the same way.  This gives three sets of rollers of two each.</p>
                            <p>First two drawn are the first to roll, then the second, and then the third sets.</p>
                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <l>SECOND BOUT.</l>
                            <p>No. 1 rolls No. 2, No. 2 rolls No. 3, and No. 3 rolls No. 1, being intended that each man whose name is taken from one hat shall roll each of the other three in turn.  The man having the greatest number of points takes first money; the second greatest number of points second money; the third greatest, third money, and the fourth greatest, fourth money.</p>
                            <p>All ties to be rolled off.</p>
                            <p>Both men off, first man off loses.</p>
                            <p>Each man has a pole and when log is poled out in position and at the word of the referee they discard the poles.</p>
                            <p>Starter to as "Are you ready?"</p>
                            <p>Then both answer "Ready", starter soon after says "Go" which is the signal to begin.</p>
                            <p>Logs to have a girdle in the center; each man to keep on his side of the girdle.  The judge or the judges are to watch the girdle and caution the roller if he nears the girdle.  To be considered a foul if a roller should get across the girdle on the other man's side and he <choice><sic>losses</sic><corr>loses</corr></choice> the bout.</p>
                            <p>The officials of the contest were:</p>
                            <l>Judge, C. O. Goss, Winona Lumber Co., Winona, Minn.</l>
                            <l>Starter, Eugene Shaw, Daniel Shaw Lumber Co., Eau Claire, Wis.</l>
                            <l>Time keeper, W. I. Carpenter, Carpenter &amp; Flournoy, Minneapolis.</l>
                            <l>Scorer, Fred H. Gilman, Northwestern Lumberman, Chicago.</l>
                            <p>The manner in which the contestants handled themselves on their uncertain footing was a marvel to the uninitiated.  Two of the contestants would go out at a time on a log about fifteen feet long, divided at the middle by a black ring, on either side of which the rivals were to stay.  When they had propelled themselves well out into the lagoon, they threw away their pike poles, and depended entirely on their agility to keep them on the right side of the log.  They watch each other like a pair of expert wrestlers waiting for an opening.  Then one would give the log a whirl that would make it <choice><sic>rovolve</sic><corr>revolve</corr></choice> rapidly for a few moments, and suddenly he would stick his spikes into it and spot it in his effort to throw his opponent into the water.  The contest lasted for over two hours before the judges were satisfied, and they then declared that T. H. Fleming, of Eau Claire, had won the first prize; A. R. Stewart, of Eau Claire, second; Gus Miller, of Winona, third; while A Dugas, of
                            
                            <pb n="182" xml:id="TMISB06-182"/>
                            
                            Little Falls and L. Cyer, of Minneapolis, tied for the fourth place.</p>
                            <p>Following the contest John Murray, of Eau Claire, gave a remarkable exhibition of log rolling on the "baby" log, a stick about four feet long and eighteen inches in diameter, which he handled under his feet as a circus acrobat does a wooden ball.  He not only rolled it side ways but end ways and several other ways, and apparently he could not throw himself off if he tried.  Altogether the contest was a remarkable exhibition of cleverness and the crowd cheered its appreciation at every opportunity.</p>

                            <p>The remainder of the afternoon was spent by the visitors taking in the various sights of the exposition, and at 7:30 in the evening, the lumbermen who were remembers of the Concatenated Order of Hoo-Hoo gathered at the Minnesota building and formed in line for a parade of the Midway.  There were about one hundred men in line, and each wore the black domino and head dress of the order.  <choice><sic>Preceeded</sic><corr>Preceded</corr></choice> by the official banner of the order, the long line passed down the Midway and over the viaduct shouting and yelling until the noise discounted the confusion of Bedlam.  After having traversed the various streets of the Midway district, the procession returned to the Minnesota building where the concatenation was held.  A choice collection of fifty kittens had been captured for the slaughter, but only thirteen finally presented themselves, and at nine minutes after nine they were started on their journey through onion beds and to the gardens of the right and left until they reached the light of Hoo-Hoo land.  The officers officiating were as follows:</p>

                            <p>The following were the candidates who presented themselves for initiation:</p>

                            <p>The usual order of initiation was observed, and also a good many thing that were out of the usual order, and there is little doubt that the new kittens are fully satisfied that their initiation was properly conducted, and that nothing was omitted that would make them remember their experience when becoming members of the order.  Following the initiation was the usual "on the roof," and at a late hour at night or rather an early hour in the morning the proceedings were brought to close with the resounding Hoo-Hoo yell.  Taken as a whole, and in detail, lumbermen's day at the Omaha exposition was a decided success, and aside from the inclemency of the weather there was nothing to mar the pleasure of the whole occasion.  The lumbermen who attended are indebted for their reception and entertainment to the following committees:</p>

                            <p>W. C. Shull, of Sioux City, accompanied by his wife and <choice><sic>chile</sic><corr>child</corr></choice>, met the Pacific coast excursionists at the Minnesota building.</p>
                            <p>Eugene Shaw, of the Daniel Shaw Lumber Co., at Eau Claire, Wis., took a good deal of interest in the log rolling contest, and as the official starter, made a marked success.</p>
                            <p>W. F. Vincent, representing the E. W. Backus Lumber Co. of Minneapolis was in attendance making friends for his firm and showing some of his customers the sights of the main exposition and of Midway.</p>
                            <p>L. C. Bricker, the traveling representative of Wheeler &amp; Osgood, manufacturers of red cedar doors at Tacoma, Wash., was around meeting old acquaintances and making new ones.  Mrs. Bricker accompanied him.</p>
                            <p>Benjamin F. Cobb, editor of the Red Radford Review, together with Al Wallerstein, who represents the Radfords in the southwest, were among the visitors, and took care of both the editorial and sales department of that hustling concern.</p>
                            <p>The visiting lumbermen were met at the various stations by committees that had been appointed, and

                            decorated with a button on which was a picture of the Nebraska building and the words, "Trans-Mississippi Lumbermen's Day, Omaha, September 9, 1898."</p>
                            <p>Rush &amp; Oliver, wholesale lumbermen of Kansas City, Mo., gave out as souvenirs an oval card on one side of which was a large Hoo-Hoo cat.  These cards were very numerous on Midway, and the enterprising Kansas City firm was well advertised by them.</p>
                            <p>Accompanying this is a cut of the badge gotten up and presented to the visiting lumbermen by Carpenter &amp; Flournoy, the well known manufacturers and wholesalers of red cedar shingles and other west coast products.  Will Carpenter and Jack Hughes, of the 
                            <figure n="drawing"><ab>TRANS MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION <lb/> LUMBERMAN'S DAY, SEPT. 9TH</ab></figure>
                            firm, were on hand to see that no one was overlooked in the distribution of badges, and if there were any who failed to receive one, they can be supplied by sending a card to the firm at their Minneapolis office.  The cut, as here presented, does not do the badge full justice as it is a very handsome affair.  A small sized copy of Old Glory hangs from a gilt pin, and pendant from this is a button bearing an excellent picture of the father of his country and the words, "Trans-Mississippi Exposition, Lumbermen's Day, September 9, 1898."  On the reverse side are the words "Compliments of Carpenter &amp; Flournoy, manufacturers and shippers of west coast products, Minneapolis, Minn.  The flag of silk and satin in the red, white and blue colors, and the picture of George Washington is also in colors.  Taken altogether it is neat, tasty and handsome.</p>
                            <p>The white pine firms of the north were having their interests looked after by a large number of the traveling fraternity.  Among them were W. T. Norway, with the Chippewa Lumber &amp; Boom Co., Chippewa Falls, Wis.; Con Crowley, with the Northern Lumber Co., Cloquet, Minn., H. D. Pettibone, with Shevlin-Carpenter Co., Minneapolis.</p>
                            <p>George Long, who looks after the retailers for the Northwestern Lumber Co. of Eau Claire, Wis., spent a large part of the time while at the fair convincing the retailers that hemlock was probably the best lumber they could get to handle, and that he could furnish it to them in unlimited quantities, or could give them white pine if they preferred it.</p>
                            <p>D. G. Saunders, of the Saunders-Turner Lumber Co.; Harry Swartz, of the Central Coast &amp; Coke Co., and R. L. Oliver, with the Lutcher &amp; Moore Lumber Co., of Kansas City, each constituted himself a committee of one to see that visiting lumbermen were taken care of, and the success of the day is in no small degree due to their efforts along that line.</p>
                            <p>The railroads were well represented.  Colonel Flournoy, lumber freight agent of the Great Western; Lyman Sholes, division freight agent of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O.; E. S. S. Smith, contracting freight agent of the K. C., F. S. &amp; M. Ry. Co., and last but not least John L. Buckner, of the Pittsburg &amp; Gulf R. R., were all in evidence.  Mr. Buckner will be remembered by many as the gentleman who had charge of the retailers' excursion from Kansas City to the Gulf last January.  Mrs. Buckner accompanied him.</p>
                            <p>Gould Dietz was out on the grounds all day looking for strangers who wanted to know where to enjoy themselves.  He had a pocket full of passes, and a lucky charm, which was guaranteed to ward off all kinds of complications to which mankind is heir.  Those who were fortunate enough to secure the charm did not feel the cold, nor were they wet by the rain that fell all day.</p>
                            <p>R. L. McCormick, of the North Wisconsin Lumber Co., Hayward, Wis., was on hand to meet again the many Nebraska lumbermen whom he first met on the occasion of the recent Nebraska Lumbermen's excursion to his place last spring.  Scott Chambers and W. W. Cleveland, the traveling representatives of the company, were also there and kept Mr. McCormick busy shaking hands with the firm's customers.</p>
                            <p>Bloomer, A. F. Bloomer, York, Neb., was there with his lumber music, and tagged out all of the visitors with his trade mark, which was a button bearing his well known design "Live and let live."  His nephew, R. H. Bloomer, of Council Bluffs, who manufactures wire fence, was also there, and as Bloomer, of York, says, there were a pair of bloomers without a bike, but they were looking for the bike.</p>
                            <p>During the day there were a number of pleasant reunions, and the renewing of acquaintances made on lumbermen's excursions that had taken place in the last year or two.  Those who had met on the Pacific Coast excursion last <choice><sic>sammer</sic><corr>summer</corr></choice>, the Nebraska excursion to the northern woods in the spring and the Pittsburg &amp; Gulf excursion from Kansas City to Galveston last winter, found pleasure in talking over the experiences of those trips.</p>

                            <head type="sub">A Big Gathering at Omaha, and Details of an Enjoyable Day Spent at the Exposition Grounds.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Lumbermen's day, September 9, at the Omaha exposition, had been well advertised, and the dealers, big and little, began to get in the town the day before in singles, doubles and dozens, until the morning of the 9th saw them coming in flocks on every train.  The weather could not have been worse, if made to order, and it took a great deal of pleasure out of what would undoubtedly have been the biggest day of the fair, for the sightseers.</p>
                            <p>To one not accustomed to the size of the grounds, the crowd did not appear large, yet despite the handicap of a cold, drizzling rain, driven by a vicious north wind, the crowd was big, for the returns from the turnstiles at evening showed an attendance of 17,541 paid admissions, and the pass holders easily brought the total up to over 22,000.  Of this number the lumbermen were the most numerous, as shown by the badges and buttons in evidence all over the grounds.  Perhaps if they had been just ordinary folks they would have looked at the weather, shrugged their shoulders and stayed in out of the wet&#8212;but they are a hardy, rollicking set of men who don't back down for weather, or anything else, as a usual thing.</p>
                            <p>They came to Omaha for a good time and Omaha received them with all the graces and pleasantries of a good host, so that they had their good time in spite of weather and mud.</p>
                            <p>They saw the exhibits in the big buildings, studied the program, and followed the events, which were carried out to the letter, just as advertised, though people who
                            <figure n="photograph"><ab>John A. Wakefield, <lb/> Secretary Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</ab></figure>
                            did not know the stuff that lumber people are made of said that the program would be "off" when they looked at the leaden sky.  It came off per schedule, however, and Omaha is getting over her mild surprise yet.</p>
                            <p>The resident dealers had everything arranged ahead so that not a visitor was neglected and everything went as smoothly as a log in a chute, despite the disagreeable cold and dampness.</p>
                            <p>The log rolling in the lagoon drew the biggest crowd of the day, as it was something so different from what the prairie people are used to that it was a curiosity.  The big lagoon was lined on both sides with a surging mass of people who watched every move of the athletic log drivers, as they rolled the sticks over and over in the water, first one way, then the other, keeping their balance with marvelous ease it seemed to the unaccustomed eye, and this with no pike poles to help them, either.  Their work was a revelation, and showed the perfection attained by the hardy river drivers who keep the logs going from the woods to the mills on the hurrying current of the northern streams&#8212;a business that the world in general knows little about.  Give any one of them a pike pole and a pair of logger's shoes, with the soles full of "corks," and he will ride anything in the way of a stick of timber that will float his weight, and do it as easily as the rest of us walk on a good sidewalk.</p>
                            <p>The meeting in the Nebraska building was supposed to be for business purposes, but nobody cared for business&#8212;they came for pleasure and to get away from business, so they simply turned the meeting into a society for the promotion of good fellowship and better acquaintance, and it was a rousing success.  Everybody threw formality to the winds and soon knew everybody else within sight.  After the program was over they went for the midway in a body and saw it from end to end, investigated its places of amusement, estimated the amount of fun that was contained in any given place and then went in to personally order about 'steen car loads, each, f. o. b. Omaha, with a rush.  They owned the whole thing by 6 o'clock and were ready to help along the Hoo-Hoo parade when it came down the line.  The midway will long remember Lumbermen's day as the one that went with a hurrah of Lumbermen's day as the one that went with a hurrah of rollicking, fun loving, fun making dealers in boards on a day off.  Every "speiler," "ballahoo" and inhabitant of this queer street is still as surprised as it is possible for them to be from the "Have you seen her" old lady in wooden shoes at the German village, clear down the line to the much abused and distorted camels of the streets of all nations, who furled their pendant lips and stared askance at the unusual hubbub of the pleasure seekers.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary John A. Wakefield.</head>
                            <p>The official title of John A. Wakefield is that of secretary, but as a matter of fact the secretary has been about the whole thing during a large part of the time, and it is to the executive ability of John A. Wakefield that much of the success of the Trans-Mississippi exposition is due.  Since leaving Iron City college, at Pittsburg, Pa., Mr. Wakefield has devoted himself exclusively to the lumber business, up to the beginning of his work for the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition.  He entered the lumber business in 1876 with the Rock Island Lumber Company, at Rock Island, Ill., where he stayed until 1880, when he moved to Omaha and engaged in business on his own account.  His yard, all covered, was located on Ninth and Browning streets, where the Missouri Pacific freight house now stands, and will be remembered as a land mark by many Nebraska lumbermen.  In 1887 the yard was moved to Eighteenth and Erie streets, and it was here that he located perhaps the finest lumber yard and sheds in the entire west, covering over under one roof something more than three acres of ground.  In June, 1893, this magnificent yard and sheds were entirely consumed by fire, and owing to the general business stagnation prevailing in the country at that time and the slowness with which the insurance was adjusted, Mr. Wakefield did not engage actively in the same line again, but in January, 1896, took charge of the business affairs of the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition.  When the affairs of the exposition are finally closed, Mr. Wakefield will not again engage in the lumber business.  While it is not intended, or even intimated, that the exposition could not have been a success without Mr Wakefield, yet the fact is that Mr. Wakefield has done his work well, and lumbermen are just clannish enough to feel a natural pride in the fact that he is a lumberman.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Hoo-Hoo Day at Omaha.</head>
                            <p>There is no telling how many Hoo-Hoo there were at the Trans-Mississippi exposition on the 9th month, 1898, otherwise known as "Lumberman's day," for almost every good lumberman is a good Hoo-Hoo, and there were hundreds of lumbermen there.  It was the day of all days for Hoo-Hoo, and the big exposition was the place of all places for a celebration.  In this, too, the weather cut some figure, it being a little chilly and damp, but it takes more than a rain storm to ruffle the fur of a black cat, so the Hoo-Hoo didn't mind so very much.  Many expressed the wish that the annual convention of the order had been transferred to Omaha instead of Cleveland, when it was found that it could not be held at Put-in-Bay.  But it wasn't, so there!</p>
                            <p>Frank Colpetzer was the guiding spirit of this part of the Lumbermen's day program, as was 'Gene Shaw of the log rolling.  As Viceregent of Nebraska, Mr. Colpetzer officiated at the concatenation in the evening and as a representative Omaha wholesaler, and a director of the exposition, he felt a patriotic interest in making the jolly crowd of Hoo-Hoo have a good time, and they all did.  There were other Omaha wholesalers there, too, and they all did their part to make everything pass off nicely, but of course none of them had any influence with Jupiter Pluvius, so the rain went merrily on.  If they had, no doubt the ancient history of Nebraska would contain no mention of drouths.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Gathered at the Minnesota Building.</head>
                            <p>At 9:09 o'clock in the morning of this eventful day, all Hoo-Hoo at the Omaha show thought of the Great Black Prince, and of the big gathering at Cleveland.  At 9:09 o'clock in the evening the ceremony of initiation began.  But previous to this time there was a gathering of the kittens at the Minnesota building.</p>
                            <p>This building was chosen for several reasons.  In the first place, it is made of logs and appeals to the lumberman instinct.  It stands for the leading industry of a state that ranks among the first for lumbering in the country.  And last, but not least, the Minnesota building is one in which lumbermen and Hoo-Hoo feel at home.  There is that pleasant informality about everything that touches the heart of lumbermen.  You can smoke in the Minnesota building wherever and whenever you wish, and you can sit with your feet on the top of the table in the reading room and warm yourself by the heat from the big white pine logs burning in the fireplace.  C. W. Field, the superintendent of this building, is from Kentucky, which is a guaranty that he knows how to entertain, but his home at present is in the biggest lumber manufacturing town in the world&#8212;Minneapolis&#8212;which is another, and in fact, several more reasons why the kittens all concatenated at the Minnesota building.  Mr. Field's brand of punch is the best kind of milk on which to nourish kittens, and the 13 that were permitted to have their eyes opened Friday night are all sturdy and strong.</p>
                            <p>So it was at the Minnesota building that the Hoo-Hoo all gathered early Friday evening and donned black robes and false cat faces, which had been very thoughtfully provided by Snark Colpetzer.  Then, nearly a hundred strong, they sallied forth to the midway, the center of attraction for kittens.  At the Pabst building&#8212;the sign of the hop

                            leaf&#8212;they all stopped, and for a time partook of the good things served therein.  It was in one sense an "on the roof," but contrary to the usual order of things, it <choice><sic>preceeded</sic><corr>preceded</corr></choice> the concatenation.</p>

                            <p>There were no speeches made, excepting an announcement from Mr. Colpetzer to the effect that all should turn in and enjoy themselves.  This they did and then the vaudeville part of the entertainment began.  Pepita, with her cutest smiles and sweetest voice, came out and amused the audience.  The gallantry, so conspicuous a part of every Hoo-Hoo, was noticeable as the kittens applauded the petite performer.  Artie Hall, whose voice Mell Eaton admired so much, and Marion Winchester, whom Dan Saunders said was the prettiest girl on the stage, and others did their turns amid the applause of the Black Cats.  Then a pretty young gentleman announced that Dan Saunders, of Kansas City, was wanted on the stage, but he was too modest to thus publicly make his debut.  After a few more rounds of Hoo-Hoo yells, the kittens formed in line and marched back to the Minnesota building, to attend the purblind 13 there awaiting their attention.</p>

                            <p>The second floor of the Minnesota building was given up to the Great Black Prince that evening.  In the large reception room the ritualistic work of the order was carried out, the adjoining rooms afforded temporary homes for the initiates, the paraphernalia and other accessories, while of course one large room was the abode of the Great Black Cat.  Down stairs in the parlor, near the blazing fireplace, some musically inclined visitor played on the piano and sang the "Meow" song, while above, "on the roof," the concatenation went merrily on.</p>
                            <p>Minnesota punch, flavored with catnip, was the popular refreshment during the evening, and it is safe to say that there never was such a realistic and typical Hoo-Hoo concatenation held as that one in the log house on the exposition grounds, on the ninth day of the ninth month, A. D. 1898.  The officers of the concatenation were:</p>

                            <p>Early Saturday morning the following telegram was received from one of the kittens at the Cleveland meeting, but it was too late to read the message to the assembled Hoo-Hoo at Omaha:</p>
                            <l>Cleveland, O., Sept. 9, 1898.</l>
                            <l>John W. Barry, Omaha, Neb.</l>

                            <p>It even made the crowd feel chilled to look on, but the six sturdy river drivers from the Mississippi and Chippewa rivers didn't seem to care much about the low temperature.</p>
                            <p>"Is the water cold?  Not a bit&#8212;not nearly as cold as the air, and it ain't a marker to the water in the old Chippewa in the early spring, when the river is filled with blocks of ice."</p>
                            <p>That is the way Thomas Flemming, of Eau Claire, Wis., the skilled river driver who came away with the

                            first and championship prize, expressed himself to the Northwestern Lumberman representative, out on the lagoon, in the midst of the contest.  But then, Flemming was only ducked once out of the five "rolls" in which he engaged, a record which was only equaled by his old chum and partner on the Chippewa, Allan Stewart, who graciously yielded first prize to Flemming, as the hour was late, and there was no opportunity to "roll" off the tie that evening.</p>

                            <p>The log rolling contest was without any doubt the feature of the day.  In fact, regular attendants at the fair who have seen anything in the way of sports and novel features since the big show opened last June were loud in their praise of the log rolling, proclaiming it novel, original and interesting.</p>
                            <p>Although the day was dark and the sky cloudy and threatening, the drizzling rain that had continued to fall throughout the forenoon let up shortly before 3 o'clock, as if in honor of the visiting lumbermen, and by that hour several thousand people had gathered around the Mirror, as the end of the lagoon adjacent to the government building is called.  They knew they were going to see something that they never had seen before, and they were not disappointed.</p>
                            <p>Eugene Shaw, the "Chauncey Depew-like" lumber manufacturer of Eau Claire, was on the grounds early, making arrangements for the log rolling, in which he was the prime mover and the ruling spirit.  He had loaded 10 prime cork pine logs on a Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha railway car the previous Saturday afternoon, September 3, at Eau Claire, and F. D. Sullivan, that railway's accommodating agent at Eau Claire, had seen that the car containing the logs was coupled on to the fast freight that left Eau Claire at 11 o'clock that evening.  On the evenings of Monday, September 5, the logs had arrived at Omaha, having been less than 48 hours on the way.</p>
                            <p>Everything was in readiness for the contest that afternoon.  The logs were in the water, and the following contestants were on hand:</p>

                            <p>The log rollers were dressed as best suited their work, wearing no superfluous clothing.  A single shirt and trousers coming to the knees was the prevailing costume.  One or two wore no stockings, but all had on the heavy river driver's shoes, with nails in the soles, that helped them to stick like flies to a molasses barrel, on the treacherous logs spinning round and round in the water.</p>
                            <p>There were 13 rolls in all to decide the contest; they were all watched with the greatest of interest, and the enthusiasm was at times so great that cheer after cheer encouraged the men on the logs to still greater effort.  The logs were 11 feet long and 17 inches in diameter.  The bark had been taken off and they had been turned so that they were perfectly round.  Two men stood on a log at a time, one at each end, and the judges' boat was always only a few feet away, to see that neither of the contestants stepped over the girdle marking the center of the log.</p>
                            <p>Following is a description of the different bouts:</p>
                            <p>Bout 1.&#8212;Miller was pitted against Murray.  The contestants were cold, and it took three minutes of rapid twirling for Miller to dislodge Murray.</p>
                            <p>Bout 2.&#8212;The second was shorter, and it took just 50 seconds for Stewart to throw Dugas off into the water.</p>
                            <p>Bout 3.&#8212;Flemming showed his agility in this bout, and after some fine work by both contestants, Flemming wet Larry Cyr, but it took him 4 minutes and 5 seconds to do it.</p>
                            <p>Bout 4.&#8212;Stewart came on again, pitted against Miller, and in 1 minute and 30 seconds Miller was "wet" good and plenty, but both showed skill and endurance.</p>
                            <p>Bout 5.&#8212;Stewart and Flemming, who had begun to show their superiority by this time, had this bout between them.  Their work was fine and was loudly applauded by the crowd.  Flemming stayed on the log the longest, having won in 1 minute and 55 seconds.</p>
                            <p>Bout 6.&#8212;A mistake on the part of the contestants in this bout, Murray and Dugas resulted in their going ahead before time was called, and Dugas being dislodged.  It was not an official roll, and the two were started properly, and Dugas won in 45 seconds, but both of the contestants were pretty well chilled.</p>
                            <p>Bout 7.&#8212;Flemming and Miller were pitted against one another, and Flemming suffered his only defeat.  The time was the quickest of all the "rolls," being only 6 seconds.</p>
                            <p>Bout 8.&#8212;A. Dugas and L. Cyr rolled and Cyr won in 15 seconds.</p>
                            <p>Bout 9.&#8212;Gus Miller rolled with Larry Cyr, and in 50 seconds Cyr was in the water.</p>
                            <p>Bout 10.&#8212;Dugas and Flemming rolled this time, and in just 30 seconds Flemming had added another victory to his list, that was already growing long.</p>
                            <p>Bout 11.&#8212;Stewart and Cyr were contestants, and although Cyr stood on the log well, he was obliged to duck at the end of 25 seconds, and Stewart received another victory.</p>
                            <p>Bout 12.&#8212;Flemming and Miller rolled against one another and in 21 seconds Miller was wet.  This made the fourth victory for Flemming out of 5 rolls.</p>
                            <p>Bout 13.&#8212;Stewart tried Larry Cyr, and in 23 seconds added another victory to his list, making four out of 5 rolls.</p>
                            <p>When the thirteenth bout was finished it was found that Flemming and Stewart were tied, each having won four out of five.  As they were comrades on the drive, Stewart gracefully yielded the championship to Flemming, and took second place for himself.  Thomas Miller, of Winona, had won three out of five, and to him was awarded the third money, while Cyr and Dugas, who had each won one bout, divided the fourth money between them.  The purse was $250, divided as follows: First, $100; second, $75; third, $50; fourth, $25.</p>

                            <p>The trick riding by John Murray, of Eau Claire, was one of the most interesting portions of the entertainment.  He rode a log only 3½ feet long, and 24 inches in diameter, and handled it with a skill that was amazing.  He would ride this little log, with the pike pole in his hands,as easily as if it was a raft, and what was still more startling, he could whirl the log over end ways, keeping his position on it all the time.  He did this four times, to the great delight of the crowd, who applauded him roundly
                            <figure n="drawing"><ab>"Rasseling the little 'un."</ab><note type="credit">Phillips <lb/> Omaha</note></figure>
                            for his skill, for it was a most difficult thing to do.  Murray is the only driver in the country who can do this feat.</p>
                            <p>The log rolling began promptly at 3 o'clock and it was nearly 5 o'clock when it was concluded.  It was intended to have an exhibition roll between several of the boys Saturday morning in the Mirror, but owing to the rainy weather this was put over until Monday morning, when it came off to the great amusement of the crowd, many of whom were lumbermen who had remained at the big show.</p>

                            <p>While Lumbermen's day at the exposition was intended for fun and sightseeing and a sober historical review of the progress made since the world's fair, yet there was a short called convention, which was very agreeable even though very short.  The lumbermen were called together in the auditorium of the Nebraska building promptly at 2 o'clock by J. C. Cleland.  He said that the session would be for a few minutes only, and that he called it to order in obedience to a resolution passed at the last annual meeting; a resolution which he proceeded to read.  Then, after making a few needed announcements as to the
                            
                            <pb n="185" xml:id="TMISB06-185"/>
                            
                            program for the rest of the day, he called upon A. H. Weir, of Lincoln, to tell the people how good he felt in spite of the rain that was pouring down outside.  Mr. Weir made a few remarks, closing with an urgent invitation to the association to hold its next annual meeting in Lincoln, and assuring the members that he desired them to accept the invitation on behalf of the lumbermen of that city.  He then closed his remarks with an appeal to all lumbermen to lend their aid and active influence to the great work which the Nebraska association was carrying on in its territory.  His remarks were closely listened to and well received.</p>
                            <p>The next speaker is well known to a large number of association workers throughout the country, and when his name, R. L. Whaley, was announced, it was received with cheers.  Like the previous speaker, Mr. Whaley was very brief and confined his remarks almost wholly to setting forth in his forcible manner the benefits to be derived in a pecuniary way to the members of the association from the insurance channel alone, and urging the united action and conscientious support of every lumberman.</p>
                            <p>The next and last speaker was John W. Barry, of the Northwestern Lumberman, Chicago, who alluded in forceful terms to the grand exhibition and to the important fact that the lumbermen had taken an active part in its inception and execution; a fact which he said lumbermen everywhere were justly proud of.  Adjournment was then taken place in the lagoon near the government building, and to which place the majority hastened away.  A few, however, remained to take part in a little side meeting.</p>

                            <p>Through the efforts of A. F. Bloomer, of York, Neb., there was a meeting for a few minutes of some of those who joined the excursion to the Pacific coast in July, 1897.  The meeting was a very brief one, consisting merely of an informal greeting.  Leonard Bronson, of the Timberman, read a number of letters of regret, etc., from J. Newton Nind, W. C. Bailey and a number of others, to the effect that they were not through with the excursion yet, but often lived over the scenes enacted on that far away coast over a year ago.  The letter of Mr. Bailey is fairly typical of all the others, and is as follows:</p>

                                <l>Minneapolis, Minn., Sept. 7.</l>
                                <p>Mr. A. F. Bloomer, York, Neb.&#8212;Dear Sir and Friend:  Replying to your kindly letter of the 3rd, I cannot very well go down to Omaha, so as to be there Friday next.  We are having our annual state fair, which began yesterday and continues all the week.  My family generally want to go on Minneapolis day, which will be Thursday next; then we expect some company.  There are many attractions here in the city&#8212;parades, bicycle races at the exposition building and other displays&#8212;some of them very fine, the newspaper men say.</p>
                                <p>I understand that Mr. Barry and Mr. Bronson are to be there, and you know that Mr. Barry likes to speak and Mr. Bronson can talk.  It is in their line.  They keep in practice and have opportunities to keep fresh, while you and I can only remember a part of what is in our minds and do not always succeed in getting that out.  It may not occur to you that I always speak with some diffidence, fearing that I shall not say what ought to be said and what is expected.  We can always talk in a beaten track, but to get at something fresh and carry along the minds and hearts of your hearers with you, is given only to the man who was born with the germs of oratory in his brain and heart.  Sometimes even the orator may wave his magic wand in vain.  The smitten waters will not let out the silver stream.  To the gifts of nature must be added culture, training and extensive reading, to bring out thoughts and words that charm, please, entrance and electrify the mental and spiritual man.  I willingly confess that I have none of those gifts and requirements.  "Give me this day my daily bread" has too long shut out from me and many others the enjoyments that come from intercourse with the writings of great minds of the past and present, heroes and heroines, who have delved deep into the mines of thought and creation, that all the world who could and would should rise into that higher intellectual, moral and spiritual life that ennobles all here, and will at last raise them to paradise.</p>
                                <p>I would greatly enjoy meeting the choice spirits who made our Pacific coast trip so memorable.  May this time reunion at Omaha lead to others.  Mr. R. B. Squires will probably represent the Minneapolis squad at Omaha, and he has a royal tongue, if you can get it wagging, but to do so, say something about Washington and Squires not being able to tell a lie; Washington about the cherry tree and Squires about his room mates upon the Pacific coast trip.  You have known him long and well.  If he behaves badly, see to him and remember that he can do much worse.  Should he get out of money, give him an opportunity to either buy or sell lumber and his financial larder will be amply restocked.  Please remember me in great kindness to yourself and all who may re-unite and rejoice with you next Friday at 2 p. m. at Omaha.  Very truly yours,</p>
                                <l>WILLIAM C. BAILEY.</l>

                            <p>When Mr. Bronson had finished reading the letters, Mr. Barry, of the Northwestern Lumberman, was called upon and spoke in a reminiscent way of the trip which brought so much pleasure to people on both sides of the mountains.</p>
                            <p>Of the excursionists the following were present:  Mr. and Mrs. T. D. Smith, C. W. Russell, R. G. Tyler and wife and T. Tyler, a pair of Bloomers, one hailing from York, Neb., and one from Council Bluffs, Ia.; L. C. Bricker and wife, J. C. Walker and wife, F. H. Crombie, Wilbur Martin, W. I. Carpenter, John W.

                            <p>The Shevlin-Carpenter Company, of Minneapolis, was represented by two old standbys in the lumber selling business.  H. D. Pettibone has traveled in the Missouri river territory for lo! these many years.  In fact, he lives in Kansas City as much, if not more, than in Minneapolis, although the latter place is his home.  This time he was accompanied by Mrs. Pettibone.  Frank Karrick, the other Shevlin-Carpenter Company salesman, has talked lumber to the retailers around Omaha since the early days of the old firm of N. P. Clarke &amp; Co.</p>
                            <p>The C. A. Smith Lumber Company was not a whit behind, for it had a good pair to draw to on the ground.  Mell Eaton has been selling lumber and sash and doors for the past 15 years, and W. E. Martin, if he has not traveled that long, knows the value of a No. 1 board or a piece of 2x4 as well as the next man.</p>

                            <p>One day last spring while Mr. Fisher was passing by the slasher in the mill of the Cordz-Fisher Lumber Company, at Birch Tree, Mo., he noticed a very peculiar formation in the end of a 12-inch board, which had been slashed off as worthless.  Picking it up he discovered the almost perfect outline of&#8212;well, what is it?  Here is the picture&#8212;a bird of some kind.  A Lumberman representative, who called soon afterward, brought the board to Chicago and had it polished and framed, the frame consisting of a combination of woods including red cedar, white oak, cypress, yellow pine, hard maple and white pine.  The frame was made by the True &amp; True Company, of Chicago, and when completed the framed board was sent to the Omaha exposition and may be seen in the exhibit of the Missouri Lumber &amp; Land Exchange Company in charge of Mr. Riner.</p>
                            <p>The photograph shows the knot formation without being retouched or pencilled in any way, representing the knot just as it occurred in the log.  If the visitor is the least curious on the point he will find on taking the picture&#8212;for that is what we will call it&#8212;down and turning it over, the same figure is on the reverse side, and a little use of his knife on the back will demonstrate to him that the thing goes clear through the board and a number of them might have been made from the piece by resawing it.  Mr. Fisher is justly proud of this rare

                            curiosity and the Northwestern Lumberman joins him in sharing this feeling and is glad to contribute a frame made up from the woods of which this paper is the accredited exponent.</p>

                            <p>Carpenter &amp; Flournoy, of Minneapolis, was the only firm from the north that gave away a souvenir badge.  Messrs. Carpenter and Hughes were on the ground personally looking to their distribution, and the badges were beauties and no mistake.  Beneath a gilt pin was a bit of
                            <figure n="drawing"><ab>TRANS MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION <lb/> LUMBERMAN'S DAY, SEPT. 9TH</ab></figure>
                            satin American flag, suspended from which is a reproduction of the features of George Washington, in colors so artistic and charming that all the ladies who saw the badges insisted on having one.  Around the edge of the medallion was the inscription:  "Trans-Mississippi Exposition, Lumbermen's Day, Sept. 9th."  On the back side, showing the inherent modesty of the firm, was the statement:  "Compliments of Carpenter &amp; Flournoy, manufacturers and shippers of west coast products."  As this firm makes a specialty of Washington state lumber and shingle products, the picture of Washington was most appropriate, it being their trade mark.</p>
                            <p>Retail lumbermen present, not securing one of these badges, can have one sent to them by writing to Carpenter &amp; Flournoy and making the fact known.  In fact, they will gladly send badges to all dealers in Nebraska desirous of having one for a souvenir, upon application, providing, of course, their supply does not give out.  The giving out of this badge was a great stroke of enterprise on the part of Carpenter &amp; Flournoy that will redound to their credit.</p>

                            <p>The first white pine manufacturer to strike Omaha for Lumbermen's day was Eugene Shaw, of the Daniel Shaw Lumber Company, Eau Claire, Wis., who arrived Thursday morning, accompanied by his wife, and George T. Thompson, the cashier of the Chippewa Valley band, of Eau Claire, and his wife.  This quartette from Eau Claire visited the fair Thursday afternoon so as to get their bearings for the next day.</p>
                            <p>On the late train Thursday night, George S. Long, of the North Western Lumber Company, arrived on the scene, accompanied by Mrs. Long, and the Eau Claire party became a sextette.  John H. Rowe, of Minneapolis, who travels for the North Western Lumber Company, also took in the celebration Friday, stopping now and then to book a few orders for lumber.</p>
                            <p>On Friday morning's train from the north came Col. R. L. McCormick, manager of the North Wisconsin Lumber Company, of Hayward, and wife and mother.  Mr. McCormick was very much pleased with the exposition, which indicates the push and enterprise of the people of Omaha.  Two of the North Wisconsin Lumber Company's salesmen were on hand, Scott Chambers, who makes the Missouri river territory, and W. W. Cleveland, who travels in Nebraska and Kansas.</p>
                            <p>W. I. Carpenter and J. A. Hughes, of Carpenter &amp; Flournoy, Minneapolis, also arrived Friday morning.  Mr. Carpenter was accompanied by Mrs. Carpenter and they remained over until Sunday night.</p>
                            <p>Charles O. Goss, vice president of the Winona Lumber Company, Winona, Minn., was on hand early Friday morning and met W. H. Byers, the company's salesman.  Mr. Goss officiated as referee at the log rolling contest, and now his friends call him "Judge" Goss.</p>

                            <p>W. J. Foy, who has charge of the George A. Hoagland sales department, at Omaha, has a military reputation throughout Nebraska, and was kept busy during the past week meeting soldier after soldier who had returned from the front.  Up to about a year ago Mr. Foy was an active national guard man, being the ranking captain of the First regiment.  His duties in the sales office became so great that it was necessary for him to resign, and now that he might have been with the boys at Manila, he is, metaphorically speaking, kicking himself during his waking hours.</p>
                            <p>J. W. Berry, of the Jewell Lumber Company, Jewell, Neb., says that so far as he can see Nebraska generally will have about as good a lumber trade this fall as it did last fall, and he knows that will be the case in his particular locality.  "I do not wish by this," said he, "to convey the idea that there is a full crop or anything like it; in fact, Nebraska will do well if she gets half a corn crop, but it must be remembered that corn is not the only resource of Nebraska, though of course it is the principal one.  There is a great deal of old corn on hand, and this is going to pull us through in great shape."</p>
                            <p>George A. Hoagland, of Omaha, and William Buchanan, of Texarkana, are great hunters, and of recent years have been exchanging trips, the territory being alternately the western lakes and Florida swamps, and some of the boys say that they will not be at all surprised to hear of these two lumbermen down in Florida in the near future.</p>
                            <p>Paul Bartlett, of the Curtis &amp; Bartlett Company, Lincoln, Neb., didn't carry an umbrella, even though it was sadly needed.  The fact is he needed both hands to shake hands with his numerous customers, whom he has the pleasure of knowing personally.</p>
                            <p>P. F. Mahoney, of Greeley, Neb., who is now interested in five yards to the extent of about $50,000, says that the reports of the Nebraska corn crop do not do her full justice, as there is much old corn in the country, and that it is largely held by speculators who will hold it for a good price.  "You can readily see," said he, "that this means the farmers will get a better price for the half crop which they have, per bushel, than they could if there had been a full crop; and take it all around will get almost
                            
                            <pb n="186" xml:id="TMISB06-186"/>
                            
                            as much money for it."  Lumbermen know what this means, of course.</p>
                            <p>W. F. Norway, of the Chippewa Lumber &amp; Boom Company, Chippewa Falls, Wis., was on hand and most vehemently denied the report that he had a little norway in stock.  "White pine," said he, "and white pine only, that's what I have to offer."</p>
                            <p>There is one man who will testify to the fact that F. F. Sayre, of the Sayre-Newton Lumber Company, Denver, Col., was not at the exposition solely for the purpose of looking around, and that men is George Long, of the North Western Lumber Company, Eau Claire, Wis.  Sayre was introduced to Long, and of course Sayre did not want to buy anything in particular, and Long in turn didn't know as he was long on any particular thing; in fact, didn't have anything to sell.  But a bystander noticed that it was not more than three seconds after Long had named a price on five or six cars until he had Sayre's order for the same snugly in his little pocketbook.  It was not because the price was low or the stock good, or because Sayre wanted it or because Long wanted to sell it; oh, no; just because they were both good fellows and wanted to have something to remember the occasion by when they each returned to their respective homes, that's all.</p>
                            <p>There is, perhaps, no other individual courting the trade of the Nebraska lumbermen who enjoys so large a personal acquaintance with them as D. C. Bradford, of the Bradford-Kinsler Lumber Company, at South Omaha.  In fact, it might be said that he put in the day, together with Mr. Kinzler, in saying "how do you do" to the boys, and agreeing to report duly the various opinions expressed of the weather man.  Mr. Bradford said that undoubtedly the shortage of the corn crop was affecting and would affect the volume of trade in Nebraska.  Not that there was not the demand for the lumber, but when people lose something, or think they have lost something, in a material way they become less liberal and are not nearly so apt to buy, even though they are abundantly able to pay.  "This," said he, "may of necessity cause us to shift our territory a little bit, but the volume of trade will probably continue about the same with the change of territory."</p>
                            <p>One of the most welcome visitors to Omaha and the exposition was Charles Curtis, of Curtis Bros. &amp; Co., Clinton, Ia.  This concern has been identified with the trade in Trans-Mississippi country from practically the time that the Trans-Mississippi country began to use sash, out of this great concern has been a source of pleasure to many lumbermen in the territory, and not a few of them availed themselves of this occasion to shake hands with Mr. Curtis, whose energy and push have contributed to the success of the firm in such a large degree, and more particularly in these later years since his brother, George M. Curtis, has been representing his district in congress.</p>
                            <p>J. S. White, of the H. F. Cady Lumber Company, appeared on the scene with a mackintosh and an umbrella and made it his especial duty to see that every visiting lumberman was as comfortable as possible under the circumstances.  He did not carry with him the city directory nor the telephone list, but for the one reason that this was not necessary.  He knew both, or seemed to, at least, without any necessity of a reference, and of course was a very handy man to have around.  Incidentally it might be said that he answered all questions concerning the midway with a little greater readiness than he was able to answer some others.  This strange freak in his memory he accounted for from the fact that he said it was their good fortune to sell a good deal of the lumber used in an about the exposition and that the teamsters had a great deal to say about things down midway.</p>
                            <p>M. T. Eddleman took occasion on Lumbermen's day to bring his wife and daughter to the exposition, an example which was followed by many others.</p>
                            <p>Wilbur Martin, representing the Grays Harbor Commercial Company, was there too, but he kept pretty well indoors, saying in explanation that he couldn't figure quite so well when the rain dropped on his paper.  He was selling, or rather he was figuring, and those who know him know that when he figures he sells.</p>
                            <p>L. E. Deemer, who represents the sash and door department of the Chicago Lumber Company, said that he thought the weather was an excellent reminder of storm sash; that it was an ill wind that blew nobody good, etc.  L. E. is always "onto" his job; sometimes on to some other fellow's, too.</p>
                            <p>The Lumberman is always glad to meet A. Barnett of McCook, Neb., but was particularly gratified to meet him on this occasion because he was accompanied by his wife.  That he would say something nice was a foregone conclusion, but it wasn't expected that he would put it just as pat as he did, for he said:  "I have read your paper ever since I began the lumber business, piling lumber at a dollar and a half a day."</p>
                            <p>James Shearon, who has charge of the business of J. V. Switzer, at Fairbury, Neb., was doing the exposition and forming the acquaintance of his fellow lumbermen.  He was accompanied by his son Harry, in soldier's garb, the latter having just returned with the Second Nebraska regiment from the south.</p>
                            <p>Did anyone see any of the buildings leaking during the rain storm?  Well, hardly.  And this is no small compliment to the "Rubberoid" roofing, a new composition roof, which was placed on the market by the H. F. Cady Lumber Company.</p>
                            <p>Another man whom Nebraska lumbermen were delighted to meet, and for many of them this was their first occasion, was F. C. Denkmann, of Weyerhauser &amp; Denkmann, Rock Island, Ill.</p>
                            <p>David Dean, of the Dean Lumber Company, Lincoln, Neb., while a new dealer there, is by no means new to the lumber trade, and Mr. Dean personally enjoys an extended acquaintance throughout the state&#8212;a fact that was apparent to any observer by the number with whom he shook hands, even though the rain was pouring down.</p>
                            <p>In any count of the lumbermen of the state of Nebraska, O. O. Snyder, of O'Neil, must be included or the list will be sadly incomplete.  While Mr. Snyder is not an old man, yet he is no chicken, having been born 1861 at Winterset, Ia.  He entered the lumber business in 1884 and now has a line of yards along the Pacific Short line in Nebraska, and, by the way, his yards make money.  That's
                            <figure n="photograph"><ab>Frank Colpetzer, <lb/> Master of Ceremonies for Lumbermen's Day.</ab></figure>
                            what he has them for.  Mr. Snyder has so thoroughly learned his job that he makes money and makes fun all the time while he is doing it.  He is one of the jolliest and withal most refined fellows that you can meet in a day's travel on the prairies of Nebraska&#8212;or anywhere else, for that matter.</p>
                            <p>President A. J. Bonekemper had so much on his hands that he turned the matter of presiding at the called meeting of the association over to that able and popular secretary, J. C. Cleland.</p>
                            <p>George W. Gribben, of Lincoln, Neb., was on hand to meet the many lumbermen with whom he is acquainted.  Mr. Gribben is not a lumberman himself, but there are few lumbermen in the state who have not an intimate acquaintance with him, for he is engaged in wholesaling coal, and a more prominent and active coal man is not to be found in the state.  Mr. Gribben confines his sales to the dealers strictly, which is one of the elements of his phenomenal success in the business.</p>
                            <p>C. L. Chaffee and H. N. Jewett could be distinguished from time to time between rain drops making hay while the sun shone.  As it did not shine much the time was
                            <figure n="photograph"><ab>J. S. White, <lb/> Of the Omaha Committee on Entertainment.</ab></figure>
                            used in greeting newcomers and in pointing out objects of interest to sightseers.  Mr. Chaffee reports that while the crops are more or less injured, north of the Platte, there is a pretty fair crop and but little complaint.</p>
                            <p>Dan Saunders, of Kansas City, said that he came to have fun, but more particularly to be dead sure that there was somebody there to represent the yellow pine end of the lumber business.</p>
                            <p>It is a rare thing to find a person who is practically beyond being surprised, but once in a while a person of such presence of mind is come across.  Such a fellow is H. A. Gabriel, of Clinton, Ia.  While on the midway the boys put up a little job on him, giving one of the little waiter girls&#8212;and she wasn't very little, by the way&#8212;15 cents if she would walk around and kiss Gabriel on the cheek.  She accepted the offer and Gabriel got a smack which would have surprised most men, but not Gabriel.  He simply stood back and said:  "Well, my dear, now I'll give you a quarter to repeat it," and she repeated it.  Gabriel thinks that's one of the practical jokes in which he is ahead.</p>
                            <p>Big Con Crowley talked for the Northern Lumber Company, of Cloquet, Minn., which he represents in the southwest, and seemed to be pretty much at home among the lumber dealers of that section.</p>
                            <p>Another salesman for a Cloquet house was Norris R. Wentworth, of the Johnson-Wentworth Company.  Mr. Wentworth has been spending much of his time lately in Nebraska, where he has been having a good trade.  He is a quiet, careful salesman, who has lots of friends.  Sunday night he left for points in northeastern Nebraska along the Omaha road.</p>
                            <p>The heavyweights among the white pine salesmen were Scott Chambers, H. E. Wood and Con Crowley.  Scott was busier than anybody's boy, looking after that Namekagon soft pine that the North Wisconsin Lumber Company makes, while Wood didn't miss any orders for the Mississippi River Logging Company, of Strickland, Wis.  The concerns that the three represented are all good ones, and it is a wonder how the dealers could make up their minds which they preferred to buy from.</p>
                            <p>M. L. Elsemore made a good bojum at the Hoo-Hoo concatenation.  In quoting prices for the Rust-Owen Lumber Company, of Drummond, Wis., down in Nebraska the past year or two, Mr. Elsemore got his voice in good training for the duties of bojum.  It is safe to say that there wasn't a member of the Nebraska excursion crowd of last March, at the exposition, who did not remember the Rust-Owen Lumber Company, the Daniel Shaw Lumber Company, and the host of other good concerns along the line of the Omaha railway that gave them such royal entertainment last spring.</p>
                            <p>Here are the names of a few of the Nebraska dealers who journeyed afar to Omaha on that memorable day, September 9, 1898:  L. W. Garoutte, C. N. Dietz, Lincoln; H. Morgenstern, Auburn; Mr. Dean, of the Dean Lumber Company, Lincoln; James W. Kearns, Auburn; Mr. Fried, of Fremont; Ed Tucker, Howe Lumber Company, Howe; President Bonekemper, of the Nebraska Lumber Dealers' Association; S. J. Whittier, Blue Hill; C. G. Roane, Campbell; F. P. McCormick, Bertrand; C. A. Galloway, Holdredge; H. St. Martin, Havelock; Mr. Barnett, McCook; "Uncle" D. P. Rolfe, Nebraska City.</p>
                            <p>A bunch of northwestern Nebraska dealers who have fine yards along the Omaha railway, and who were in attendance, consisted of the following:  Walter Holmquist, of Oakland; George Little, Little Lumber Company, Lyons; E. C. Huston, of the Huston Lumber Company &amp; Son, Lyons.  Mr. Holmquist is pretty well known among the white pine manufacturers from his occasional visits to Minneapolis and other mill points.</p>
                            <p>"Old Kit," otherwise known as C. H. Kitridge, the Fairmount, Neb., retailer and philosopher, viewed things from an experienced standpoint, Friday, it being his second or third visit to the show.  He reported business so good that he could hardly get away from home for a day.</p>
                            <p>Joe Copeland, of Fredericksburgh, Ia., retailer, accompanied by his family, took in the midway, Friday, having only one thing to regret, and that was the absence of Chet Carpenter, the heavyweight retailer of Fredericksburgh, who is quite a chum of his.</p>
                            <p>E. M. Warren, chief of the white pine grading bureau, with headquarters in Minneapolis, enjoyed the log rolling contest just as much as if he had once been a river driver himself.  After devoting Saturday to business, Mr. Warren put aside all cares and spent Sunday on the midway facing a stiff nor'wester and keeping a sharp lookout for some one else wearing a straw hat.  He couldn't find anyone so attired, however.</p>
                            <p>The white pine salesmen didn't quite monopolize the affair by any means, as the following aggregation of southern pine talent on hand is evidence:  Harry Swartz, Central Coal &amp; Coke Company; Ray Oliver, Rust &amp; Oliver; Luther Creason, Turner Lumber Company; R. A. Norton, Norton Lumber Company, and R. L. Oliver, Lutcher &amp; Moore Lumber Company, all of Kansas City; and Ben Collins, of the Monarch Lumber Company, St. Louis, Mo.  Dan Saunders was also there, holding up his record as a capital fellow.</p>
                            <p>The Rice Lake Lumber Company, of Rice Lake, Wis., was ably and creditably represented by R. L. Andres, who has been making the Missouri river territory this year for this well known white pine concern.  Mr. Andres made his headquarters at the Millard.</p>
                            <p>W. F. Vincent, well known as a retail lumber dealer at Sterling, Neb., is now selling lumber on the road for that old, reliable Minneapolis house, the E. W. Backus Lumber Company.  Mr. Vincent was shaking hands with his old friends among the retailers at the exposition, Friday.</p>
                            <p>Among the Omaha wholesalers who did all they could to entertain the visiting lumbermen was D. C. Bradford, of the Bradford-Kinsler Lumber Company, of South Omaha; A. G. Mucke, who travels in Nebraska for the same company, and H. B. Huston, another itinerant for the same company, were giving their old customers and some new ones the "glad hand."</p>
                            <p>Does anyone suppose that Capt. T. H. Stevens, the popular Minneapolis jobber, would miss a lumbermen's celebration at Omaha?  Not by a long way.  The genial captain spent too many years in Sioux City in the lumber business to let an opportunity of this nature go by.  He was on hand bright and early and gave the younger fellows a pointer or two on how to do the matter up brown.</p>
                            <p>Some people call him "Reddy," but however that may be, W. B. Arnold is always ready to figure an order for the Frost-Trigg Lumber Company, of St. Louis.</p>
                            <p>B. L. Van Cleave talked yellow pine for the Long-Mansfield Lumber Company, of St. Louis.</p>
                            <p>W. C. Shull, the Sioux City line yard man and member of the firm of J. &amp; W. C. Shull, was accompanied by his young son, a promising fellow, who already show indications of making a shrewd lumberman when he is a few years older.</p>
                            <p>The Cloquet Lumber Company, of Cloquet, Minn., was represented by Mr. Dickman, its Missouri river territory salesman, while Mr. Dickey, a salesman with a somewhat similar name, took care of the interests of Chris Mueller &amp; Sons, the popular Davenport, Ia., manufacturing firm.</p>
                            <p>Thomas Francis Mahoney, the Greely Center, Neb., retailer, who was the life of the excursion up north last March, has lost none of his ginger.  He went into Hoo-Hoo Friday night, and discovered that he and Col. Dick Flournoy used to be next door neighbors when they were lads.  As neither of them was aware of the fact before, there is no opportunity for damages from either side.</p>
                            <p>W. W. Catlin went down from Minneapolis, where he manages the sales department of the Shell Lake and White River Lumber Companies, of Shell Lake, and White River, Wis.  At the Paxton he was reinforced by "Ambidexter" Joe Woodward, the tall pine of Nebraska, who wanders around among the retailers of the prairie state.  "Billie" Catlin used to travel more or less down in that territory and was at home in his old room in the Paxton.</p>
                            <p>J. C. Barclay, who used to travel for W. S. Hill &amp; Co., of Minneapolis, in the southwest, is now a manufacturers' agent at Council Bluffs, Ia.  He took the street car and came over and hobnobbed with the visitors.</p>
                            <p>A party of Omaha lumbermen discovered doing the midway Friday afternoon consisted of D. C. Bradford and Al Kinsler, of the Bradford-Kinsler Lumber Company, South Omaha; C. N. Dietz; Gould Dietz, of the Sheridan Coal Company, and J. S. White, of the H. F. Cady Lumber Company.  "Billy" Norway, with the Chippewa Lumber &amp; Boom Company, Chippewa Falls, Wis., was chaperoning the party.</p>
                            <p>T. R. French, of Lincoln, says that Nebraska's crop is very fair, and that a great deal of lumber is being used throughout the state this year.  Mr. French is a member of the wholesaling firm of Wixson, Bronson &amp; French, of Rhinelander, Wis., and lives or rather makes his headquarters at Lincoln, spending most of his time out visiting the dealers of Nebraska, where he is very well known, having traveled in that territory for many years.  His firm expects to handle about 10,000,000 feet of lumber this year, a large part of it going into Nebraska.  They are now running their planing mill overtime to fill orders.  Wixson, Bronson &amp; French have a good stock of dimension, small timbers and inch lumber, and are in a position to furnish a nice lot of all white pine No. 3 boards.</p>
                            <p>M. E. Nichols, of Minneapolis, is looking after the Nebraska trade of the Amery Lumber Company, Amery, Wis., and so found time to run into Omaha for Lumbermen's day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">The "Omaha" Road Carried the Crowds.</head>
                            <p>The people from the northwest rightfully think there is no other railway like the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha, for it is the route which they take from Wisconsin and Minnesota points and the Twin cities to the Omaha exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha's fine train out of Minneapolis every night contains several vestibuled sleepers, and by leaving Minneapolis at 7:10 p. m., Omaha is reached at 9 o'clock the next morning.  Every comfort is given the traveler, and, in fact, traveling over this road is made a luxury.  It is the shortest route between Minneapolis and St. Paul and Omaha, and is doing the lion's share of the business.</p>
                            <p>General Passenger Agent Teasdale believes that the visitors to the exposition deserve the best service to be had, and he is giving it to them.  For those who do not care to travel at night, a morning train leaves Minneapolis in time to reach Omaha at 11:50 at night.  It keeps W. G. L. Tucker, the advertising agent, busy telling the public of the improvements and comforts the Omaha has to offer, despite the fact that he is an old newspaper man, and knows what it is to get off a chunk of "rush" copy.</p>
                            <p>John F. Wilcox, the Minneapolis sash and door manufacturer, was right at home with his friends in the trade in the southwest.  He rode the camels on the midway, drank punch at the state buildings, and marched with the Hoo-Hoo to the Pabst building.  He had a good time, for he was with Jack Hughes much of the time, but when he started home Saturday night he forgot to get his excursion ticket signed at the depot, and had to pay full fare to Minneapolis.  Of course a man isn't supposed to have much money left after spending several days in Omaha, but by taking up a collection from several lumbermen friends of his who happened to be along, he managed to make the riffle.</p>

                            <p>It has been over a month since the children of Omaha and its adjourning cities enjoyed a holiday at the exposition and this morning thousands of them improved the opportunity offered by the management to spend a day on the grounds at a normal expense.  While their presence was not accompanied by any formal demonstration there could be no mistaking the fact that it was Children's day.  The youthful men and women fairly inundated the grounds.  They came in couples and groups and street car loads and enjoyed the bright sunshine and the pretty scenes around them with a zest that furnished no end of amusement for the older visitors.</p>
                            <p>The gates had not been open an hour before the grounds looked as though some mammoth Sunday school picnic had been turned loose.  Children poured through the main entrances by the hundred and in an hour or two they had pretty thoroughly preempted the entire enclosure.  They were all provided with lunch baskets and these were taken charge of at the Boys' and Girls' building while the owners were allowed to enjoy their outing without restraint.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the big crowd of children there was nothing to distinguish the day from any other.  Railroad day was not celebrated to any apparent extent.  The party of railroad officials that was brought in last night spent most of the day on the grounds, but there was no general effort on the part of the western roads to give the occasion any particular significance.  The delightful weather brought out a good general crowd and the regular program of features furnished ample amusement.  Tomorrow the admission will be 25 cents all the afternoon and evening and with a continuance of pleasant weather the Sunday record should be largely exceeded.</p>

This information will be passed through the camp and the Indians will throw themselves into the saddle and charge down upon a party in the center of the grounds, where the burning process is about to take place.  The members of the tribes will rescue their man and in addition they will capture a number of prisoners, who will be tied up for the slaughter.  While disposing of these prisoners Young Black Wolf will rally a large party of warriors and will ride in to the rescue, engaging the Sioux and their allies.  Here the battle will rage for a time, at the end of which the Sioux will be slaughtered, but not until they have mowed down the ranks of their enemies.</p>
                            <p>At the last battle the crowd rushed in so that the Indians had but little room in which to do battle.  This time this will be overcome, as seats for 5,000 persons will be provided.  Ropes will be strung around the place occupied by the Indians and inside of these none will be allowed except the old Indians, the squaws and the children of the various tribes, and even these will be compelled to remain in the little grove near the center of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Old Geronimo will be a guest of honor and will occupy a seat on the raised platform in front of Captain Mercer's quarters.  Just before the fight he will be introduced and may possibly deliver a short speech in the Apache language.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Local Interest Not Lacking, but the Railroaders Are Too Busy to Take Any Part in the Preliminaries.</head>
                            <p>There is no celebration of Railroad day at the exposition today because none of the Omaha railroad men would work up a program for the day and invite representatives of the railroad fraternity from outside points to be present.  The excuses offered for the failure of what might have been a notable event are amusing.  The passenger men say they are too busy waiting on travel, the freight men spend all their time watching the new rates made daily, and operating men have their troubles handling the extra sections and special trains that come in and go out of here, and the higher officials refuse to enthuse over any occasion that might lead to a holiday at headquarters.</p>
                            <p>Save for the party of distinguished operating officials of eastern lines brought in here on a special train Friday evening by the Northwestern road there are very few visiting railroaders here for the day.  All of these gentlemen spent Friday evening at the grounds under the guidance of John A. Kuhn, general agent of the Northwestern, and were highly delighted with the big show.  General Manager Stevens of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and General Superintendent Blodgett of the Lake Shore road were particularly pleased with the illuminated view of the grand court and pronounced it superior to anything at the World's Fair.  This party will return to Chicago on a special train on Saturday night.</p>
                            <p>In honor of Railroad day at the exposition General Manager Bidwell of the Elkhorn road ordered the general headquarters closed at noon and the remainder of the day was given to the employes to spend at the exposition grounds.  The other railroad headquarters closed at 3 o'clock, as usual on Saturday afternoons.  The city offices kept open all day.  None of the Omaha terminal lines having their headquarters in other cities brought in the expected excursions of their own employes to see the exposition as the Pennsylvania and other roads did during the World's fair.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Braves Work with a Will to Put the Grounds in Good Order.</head>
                            <p>People who have an idea that the Indian will not work should have been at the camp yesterday, where they would have seen the men laboring as industriously as though they were being paid at the rate of 50 cents per hour.  The occasion was the cleaning of the camp and putting it in a more perfect sanitary condition.</p>
                            <p>Shortly after 8 o'clock Captain Mercer called the several interpreters in and told them what was wanted.  These men passed the word out to the Indians and in a remarkably short space of time a couple of Indians appeared, armed with hoes, rakes, shovels and axes.  They went to work in the vicinity of their respective camps, digging out the brush, raking the hay and dead grass into heaps and gathering up the rubbish.  This having been done, the grass and other stuff that would burn was fired, while the balance was loaded into wagons and hauled away.  This having been accomplished the uneven places were smoothed off.  The location of a number of the tepees was changed, leaving the space in front of the office buildings free from obstructions.</p>
                            <p>While at their work the Indians presented rather a picturesque appearance, clad in <unclear reason="covered"/> blankets and leggings.<unclear reason="covered"/>idedly the nattiest ap-<unclear reason="covered"/>lot, all of them wear-<unclear reason="covered"/> dark shirts and snow<unclear reason="covered"/> While they worked <unclear reason="covered"/> more skillful in the <unclear reason="covered"/> some of the northern <unclear reason="covered"/></p>

                            <p>The Geronimo Apaches are putting up tepees down in the center of the lot just north of the Apiary building, Natches, Geronimo's head man, overseeing the work.  The tepees are of the ordinary kind, the covering being of heavy canvas.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Thirty Thousand Sacks Handed Out to Exposition Visitors Yesterday.</head>
                            <p>"I never knew that so many people were fond of grapes," remarked Peter Youngers, superintendent of the Nebraska horticultural exhibit, as he stood on the west steps of the Horticulture building yesterday morning and watched people file into the building to receive the grapes which Nebraska was giving away.</p>
                            <p>It was Nebraska Grape day at the exposition, and it seemed as though everybody wanted to sample the fruit.  The rush set in as soon as the grounds opened yesterday morning, and it continued until night.  There were 5,000 baskets of the fruit, which was put up in sacks&#8212;six sacks to the basket&#8212;so that it is easy to figure that there were enough for 30,000 people, providing each received a sack, and most of them who were upon the grounds did.  All the grapes were raised in the state and were sent in by the growers.  Having been received the night before, they were fresh and in prime condition, and the general verdict is that they were good enough for anybody.</p>
                            <p>The grape day originated some months ago when it was proposed to have all of the states exhibiting fruit join forces and make it an occasion when every state could be given the proper credit.  None of the states, however, saw fit to come in, and rather than have it a failure, Superintendent Youngers decided that the name should be changed to Nebraska Grape day and Nebraska would furnish the grapes and receive all of the credit.  Nebraska did furnish the grapes and the affair was a success in every sense of the word.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the other states not assisting in furnishing the fruit and then the representatives saying that they were not invited to participate, Superintendent Youngers remarked: "As soon as it was decided to have a grape day, notices were served on all of the superintendents in charge of the state horticultural exhibits, inviting them to join with Nebraska.  We waited as long as possible and as none of them signified their willingness to take part, we saw that unless we took hold and did all of the work, the affair would be a failure.  Not being people out here who allow failures to occur, we concluded to show the easterners and the representatives of the other transmississippi states what we could do, and I guess now that we have succeeded in showing them.  We have shown them that the Nebraska grapes are the best in the world, and that they are just as abundant and free as they are good."</p>
                            <p>The arrangement for giving out the grapes was perfect.  People who were grape hungry entered the west door of the Horticulture building, passed up to the Nebraska tables, received their sacks of grapes and then turned to the left, passing out through the side door.  Those who did not want grapes, simply followed the aisles and went on, examining the exhibits, the delivery of the grapes not interfering with their examination.  On account of the arrangement the floors of the building were not littered, as no grapes were allowed to be eaten until the people had passed outside.</p>

                            <p>The attendance during the last seven days has been fairly well sustained under very adverse conditions.  The rains which kept people away during the last two days of the preceding week seriously affected the first part of the week and interrupted the tide of arrivals that was reaching such encouraging proportions.  While the week was prolific of features none of them were of such a character as to draw any special crowds and the show depended almost exclusively on the patronage of general visitors.  Under these conditions the aggregate attendance for the week mounted well above the 100,000 mark, but did not reach the record of the two preceding weeks.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday was an exceptionally successful Saturday and there was a big crowd on the grounds, which increased constantly until well into the evening.  The arrivals were especially numerous during the afternoon, when most of the local railroad offices were closed in order to permit their employes to go out to the grounds.  This was the only feature which distinguished the celebration of Railroad day and the attendance of the children of Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs was easily the most striking incident of the day.</p>
                            <p>It has been over a month since the children of Omaha and its adjoining cities enjoyed a holiday at the exposition and thousands of them improved the opportunity offered by the management to spend a day on the grounds at a nominal expense.  While their presence was not accompanied by any formal demonstration there could be no mistaking the fact that it was Children's day.  The youthful men and women fairly inundated the grounds.  They came in couples and groups and street car loads and enjoyed the bright sunshine and the pretty scenes around them with a zest that furnished no end of amusement for the older visitors.</p>
                            <p>The gates had not been open an hour before the grounds looked as though some mammoth Sunday school picnic had been turned loose.  Children poured through the main entrances by the hundred and in an hour or two they had pretty thoroughly preempted the entire enclosure.  They were all provided with lunch baskets and these were taken charge of at the Boys' and Girls' building while the owners were allowed to enjoy their outing without restraint.</p>
                            <p>The government board of exhibit met at Washington yesterday and took decided action in favor of making every possible effort to co-operate in the celebration of the great Peace Jubilee.  William H. Michael, in charge of the State department, introduced a strong resolution to this effect, which was unanimously adopted.  Mr. Michael urged that this celebration would be essentially the national peace jubilee of the year.  He called attention to the fact that President McKinley, with the members of his cabinet and other distinguished and representative citizens, would be present and this, in itself, would make the occasion an event of prodigious interest.  In addition to approving the resolution each member of the board took occasion to give the assurance that he would carry out the spirit of the resolution with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Indians Run Out of Ammunition and Are Unable to Finish.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>While not adhering strictly to the program in fighting their sham battle yesterday afternoon, the Indians furnished several thousand people with amusement and at the same time put on the hottest show that has been seen since the establishment of the camp.  According to the program there were to have been three separate and distinct engagements.  Instead there was only one, yet that was a hair raising affair and everybody went away satisfied.  The plan was to have the Sioux and their allies attack the Blackfeet and their allies.  The attacking party was to win a victory but be repulsed in the second fight, after which the enemy was to be engaged again and in the finish the Sioux and the tribes associated with them were to be slaughtered like sheep and driven off the field.  The failure to carry out the plan of the program was due to the fact that the Indians burned all of their powder in the first fight and consequently the other two engagements had to go by default.</p>
                            <p>As a preface to the great fight of the afternoon, as soon as the crowd was seated Captain Mercer marched the squaws up in front of the reviewing stand, tribe by tribe, and introduced them.  The same course was pursued with the Indians who were on foot, after which the mounted men were lined up.  The members of the band rode ahead, with the chiefs following twenty or more paces in the rear.  As the gaudily painted and feather bedecked warriors galloped up in front of the reviewing seats they were loudly cheered, but the ovation of the occasion was for Geronimo, who took part in the dress parade.  His little band moved up in good order and looked as fine as silk, clad in their blue blouses and black slouch hats.  The old man rode about 100 feet behind and sat on his horse as though he was a part of the animal.  When a short distance from the low row of seats he halted and pulled off his yellow skull cap, the only article of wearing apparel that was not strictly military.  After being introduced he bowed in a graceful manner, stuck the spurs into the flanks of his horse and rode rapidly away.  Cheer after cheer followed the old man, furnishing conclusive evidence that he is the most popular Indian on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The introduction having been completed Captain Mercer fired his pistol, which was the signal that the friendly relations between the Indians had become somewhat strained and that hostilities were about to be declared.  The Sioux and their allies galloped off toward the east end of the lot and awaited results.  The Blackfeet, followed by the Indians who had cast their lot with them, went down into the vicinity of the grounds where the commissary department is located.  There was nothing to indicate that there was a war to be declared.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">Bald Eagle in a Bad Fix.</head>
                            <p>Suddenly an Indian almost naked bounded out of one of the tents of the enemy and dodging from tree to tree, hurried over to the place where his people were stopping.  He reported that his brother, Bald Eagle, had been captured while out on a hunt and that he was soon to be burned at the stake.  This Indian was none too soon, for he had not much more than told the story to Yellow Hawk, who was in command of the Sioux, when a couple of Indians singing and whooping appeared in the vicinity of one of the electric light poles, leading Bald Eagle, who was at once bound hand and foot and tied to the aforesaid pole.  He squirmed and said that he only did it in fun and would never do so again.  This, tale, however, did not go and he was informed in the best Sioux that old Came-So-Far, a Wichita, could muster that doing it once was enough.</p>
                            <p>Bald Eagle made some remark about it being a dirty Indian trick to tie a man up and roast him over a slow fire, but this remark only caused a few smiles to pass over the lips of the fellows who were gathering up enough straw to kindle the wood that was piled about the poor unfortunate.  At this point the match was applied and the smoke ascended as high as the trees, while from within the cloud came the voice of the man who pleaded.  He did not plead for mercy, simply saying:  "If you are going to do any burning, do so, and not convert me into smoked meat."  The clouds of smoke rolled higher and higher and some Indian brought out a drum and half a dozen of the naked fellows about the fire pounded upon it, while the others formed a circle about pole and man and danced and sang.  An Indian who said he knew, said that it was a war song, but that don't make any difference.</p>
                            <p>The fire grew pretty hot around Bald Eagle by this time and he commenced to think that he had been forgotten by his Sioux associates and the fellows who had cast their lot with them.  This, however, was not the case, for like the hero in the dime novel, he was to be burned and that at just the right time.</p>
                            <p>About the time that the fire commenced to singe the ends of the ropes that bound Bald Eagle and while his captors were <unclear reason="torn"/> followed by some 200 Sioux and other Indians whooping like demons.  When less than 100 feet away they fired into the howling mob that surrounded Bald Eagle and you never saw such a scrambling for the woods.  The Blackfeet and their followers simply tumbled over one another to get out of the way and it was right here that the Sioux got in their work.  They aimed low and every shot brought down an Indian.  Red Dog showed his good generalship by apparently being on every place of the field at the same time.  He rode back and forth, waving his war bonnet high above his head and cheering his men on to victory.  He would have won the fight in a canter had it not been for the fact that a lot of Blackfeet and other Indians who had been out to a wedding returned about this time.  When they got into camp the squaws informed them that a big fight was going on over on the open ground and without waiting for their coffee they rushed out and were soon engaged in the contest.  Reinforced with fresh men the odds were against the Sioux, and after an engagement lasting the better part of an hour they commenced to retreat in good order, leaving behind many of their supposed dead and wounded.  However, they had inflicted heavy loss upon the enemy and had compelled a great number to bite the dust.</p>

                            <p>It was right here that the battle stopped, and consequently it will go down in history as one of those fights where neither side licked.  A running fire had been kept up too long and just as the Blackfeet got the Sioux nicely on the run they discovered that they were out of cartridges.  They stopped for an instant and the Sioux taking advantage of the stop turned and started to renew the fight when they, too, discovered that they were short of ammunition.  Both sides being in the same condition the battle was over, but it was the general opinion that the Sioux had one or two points in their favor.</p>

                            <p>Members of the official party which accompanied Governor Barnes from Oklahoma are unstinted in their praise of the exposition.  In these interviews the sentiment is crystallized:</p>
                            <p>Governor Barnes of Oklahoma&#8212;Every one of the 800 Oklahomans who visited Omaha yesterday and today are highly pleased with the grand proportions and the great beauty of the exposition.  The gubernatorial party, consisting of all the territorial officers and families, and the ten military staff officers, accompanied by the First Regiment band, Oklahoma National Guard, took in the many pleasures of the Midway last evening and are loud in their praises of the great entertainment.  The Indian feature and sham battle are immense.  I am highly delighted with the many courtesies extended by President Wattles and General Manager Clarkson and will go home and send back many thousands of people to witness the great attractions exhibited at the fair grounds.</p>
                            <p>Hon. Harper S. Cunningham, Attorney General of Oklahoma Territory&#8212;I have been enjoying myself very much for the last three days visiting the exposition and examining the marvelous displays found there.  I only regret that I have not three months' time to spare.  I am sure that every moment could be spent with profit in an educational way and that, too, without exhausting the subject.  As an Oklahoman I wish to say that our people are especially well satisfied with their visit and we all appreciate the kind treatment and cordial greeting given to us by the management of the exposition and citizens of Omaha.</p>

                            <p>Saturday is something of an off day with the exhibitors in the Horticultural building and few of them receive any fresh exhibits, due to the fact that they prefer to have their fruit look neat and clean on Monday morning.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday Superintendent Driscoll of the Idaho exhibit received a large consignment of grapes, cantaloupe, prunes and crab apples.  His exhibit now contains samples of all of the varieties of fruit grown in the state and on the market at this time of the year.  The quality is fine and the exhibit always draws a crowd.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Hatch is proud <choice><sic>fo</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> the fact that he is showing 100 varieties of apples, all raised in Wisconsin.

                            <p>A number of Minnesota and North Dakota people who are interested in the culture of flax met in the Press building last night and held a general discussion relating to raising flax for the fiber.  The principal speakers were Miss Ford of North Dakota and Mrs. Oberg of Minnesota, both of whom are enthusiasts upon the subject.  Another meeting will be held in the near future at which time steps will be taken to have Secretary Wilson address an audience upon the subject of flax raising during his visit to the exposition next month, it being understood that he will be with the presidential party.</p>

                            <p>Nebraska has endeared itself to the thousands of children who visited the exposition yesterday.  All day long they shouted the praises of the state and when they left the grounds last night they were even more enthusiastic than in the morning.  The little ones had been having their inning and in a measure they had been the guests of the state, as they had each been presented with peaches and great sacks of Nebraska grown grapes.</p>
                            <p>When Nebraska had its grape day Superintendent Youngers conceived the idea of giving the children a treat and as yesterday was designated as Children's day by the exposition authorities he decided to do the treating yesterday.  He sent out among the fruit growers and had them send in large quantities of grapes and peaches.  They came early yesterday morning and when the doors of the Agricultural building swung open the fruit was ready to give out.  It was stacked on long tables on the Nebraska space and as the little tots passed along they were liberally supplied.  There was some repeating during the day, but this was frowned down upon and it was seldom tried a second time.</p>
                            <p>The fruit that was given away was some of the finest seen in the building.  Special care had been exercised in selecting the fruit and then before it was given out it was picked over, so that nothing except the soundest and what was ripe was given to the children.</p>
                            <p>The two special days left the Nebraska fruit exhibit in ragged condition, but today it will be rearranged and Monday morning when the Horticultural building opens the Nebraska exhibit will look as well as at any time since the opening of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>A section of a wild Mustang grapevine, measuring thirty-seven inches in circumference, has been received from south Texas and added to the Texas exhibit in the Agricultural building.  It was forwarded by C. I. Snow of Normanna, Bee county, who sends a description of this particular grapevine, as well as sending clusters of the wild grapes, together with samples of the wine.  Mr. Snow says that the vine grew in a clump of live oaks and that its branches extended in all directions, climbing from tree to tree and forming an arbor, covering nearly two acres of ground.  In his letter he adds:  "I stood on the ground and picked a barrel full of grapes and I suppose there were several wagons still remaining on the vine."</p>
                            <p>O. M. Peterson, one of the commissioners from Texas and the founder of the Normanna settlement, speaking of Mustang grapes, said:  "The green grapes make excellent preserves and are picked in May and June.  In July and August the grapes ripen on the vines and when treated make a superior quality of jelly and wine.  Tons of them go to waste annually or are eaten by mockingbirds, raccoons, possums and foxes.  The grapes being indigenous to the soil, we have ascertained from recent experiments that by grafting the fine varieties of cultivated grapes onto the Mustangs very successful and important results may be obtained."</p>
                            <p>In the Texas exhibit there are muscat and Tokay grapes from vines that were grafted on the Mustang and it is said that they ripen from two to three weeks earlier than in California.</p>
                            <p>Next week Mr. Peterson returns to Texas, taking with him a party of excursionists.  He expects to come to Omaha in October at the head of a large delegation, the members of which will visit the exposition and participate in the Peace Jubilee and Hand Shaking carnival.</p>

                            <p>Like a phantom, hard luck follows Turning Eagle, a rosebud Sioux warrior.  Yesterday he was the victim of two accidents, neither of which was serious, yet both were painful.</p>
                            <p>Turning Eagle was in the battle on the Little Big Horn where General Custer was killed and one of the Indians who fought with Sitting Bull.  Some years ago he accepted the ways of the white man, pulled off his blanket and donned a suit of store clothes.  Since that time he has been a pretty good Indian, but just now he is having hard luck, just the same.  Yesterday morning when the Indians were rehearsing for the fight of the afternoon, Turning Eagle got too close to another Indian who had a gun in his hand and as a result he received the full force of the explosion of the charge of powder.  The shot took effect in the pit of the stomach, burning off a patch of skin about the size of a saucer.  Later in the day and during the battle between the Indian Turning Eagle had more bad luck.  He was riding down on an Arapahoe and was apparently about ready to club the man to death with his gun.  Not desiring to take any chances, the Arapahoes leveled his gun at Turning Eagle and fired.  The muzzle of the gun was not more than three feet from the man's head and the burning powder from the cartridge inflicted a severe <choice><sic>found</sic><corr>wound</corr></choice>, filling his face with powder and tearing off a big patch of skin from one of his cheeks.</p>

                            <p>Ohio day, October 5, promises to draw a good sized crowd from the Buckeye state.  Commissioner Greene is in receipt of a number of letters from there and all of them indicate that several hundred at least of the Ohioans will be here.  A round trip rate of $30 has been made from Toledo.  This includes the railroad fare, sleeper, meals enroute and while in Omaha and admissions to the exposition for three days.  Already 250 tickets for this excursion have been sold in Toledo alone.  The excursion is in charge of Charles H. Gates of Toledo, who hopes to bring in from 1,000 to 1,500 people.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Greene has received a wire from the governor, who says that he and his staff will come.  It is probable that they will come on a special train and may get in a couple of days before the exercises are held.</p>

                            <p>There will be no formal celebration of Wyoming day Monday, although the reduced railroad rates that were secured for the occasion will remain in force and there will be more or less patronage from that state.  Governor Richards writes General Manager Clarkson that it will be impossible for him to attend the exposition at this time and consequently advises that the exercises of the day be declared off.  The governor remarks that he is very sorry that his state has not exhibited a more creditable enthusiasm in the exposition.  The legislature refused to make any appropriation and the scheme to enlist the co-operation of the counties was also a failure.  The mineral exhibit that was finally sent here was made up largely at his personal expense and consequently he does not feel like celebrating.  Governor Richards adds, however, that a large number of Wyoming people will visit the exposition during the week.</p>

                            <p>One of the funny incidents of Children's day was incidental to the distribution of free fruit to the little ones by some of the exhibitors at the Horticulture building.  In addition to all the grapes they could hold several hundred big watermelons were distributed.  In some cases the melons were bigger than the recipients and it was amusing to see a long procession of little tots, each of which lugged a melon that she could scarcely carry, and yet didn't want to let go.  During the afternoon little girls 7 and 8 years old were laboriously trudging about the main court, hanging like grim death to huge melons that they apparently intended to carry around with them until they went home.</p>

His proposition was for $800 per night.  No action was taken, as a number of the members of the committee were absent and also because there was a desire to investigate the matter and ascertain if the feature would justify the expense.</p>

                            <p>General Manager Clarkson is working up what promises to be a big reunion of the old settlers' association of Nebraska for Friday, September 30.  The Old Settlers' organization of Lancaster county has previously arranged to spend the day at the exposition and President J. C. F. McKesson and Secretary E. T. Roberts are actively working out the plan to make the celebration general.  Quite a number of the Nebraska counties have organizations of this character and it is proposed to bring them all together at the exposition with a view to forming a state organization.  The idea is favorably received by all the organizations that have been heard from and there are prospects that the event will assume quite extensive proportions.</p>

                            <p>H. A. Adams and wife are in the city visiting the exposition.  Mr. Adams is an attorney of Minneapolis.</p>
                            <p>Instead of the fourth prize on the best collection of palms going to Mrs. Alvin Saunders, as was stated, it was given to E. C. Erfling.</p>
                            <p>Attorney Tawney of Winona, Minn., accompanied by his wife, is in the city, attending the exposition.  He is very much pleased with the buildings and the exhibits and regards them as being equal to those of the World's Fair.  Mr. Tawney owns 500 acres of land in this state.</p>
                            <p>The Midway concessionaires and employes gave a dance at Tom Cummins' hotel last night, the proceeds of which went to the exposition guards.  The affair commenced at 11 o'clock and continued until a late hour this morning.  A large number of people were present and a still larger number of tickets were sold.</p>
                            <p>The war relics that were shipped from Santiago to be exhibited at the exposition seem to have gone astray.  They should have been heard from before this but no word has been received except the bare fact that they were shipped sometime ago.  A tracer has been sent out and Major Ward hopes to be able to locate the shipment in a few days.</p>
                            <p>Major Ward of the War department has returned from Washington.  The exhibit of the department has been increased by the arrival of another Spanish flag, which will be installed today.  This was taken from the Spanish converted cruiser "Mexico" at the surrender of Santiago to General Shafter July 17.  It is a much larger flag than the one previously received.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Brooks, the butter sculptress, is now working upon another butter model of the bust of Admiral Dewey.  She is doing the work in the car in the Dairy building.  Yesterday Charles Dewey of Burlington, Vt., a brother of the admiral, visited the building and was very much struck with the likeness of his brother.  He said that it was good and resembled him very much.</p>
                            <p>Captain A. Warren Yancey of the United States Volunteer Signal corps, who is in command of the detachment that was sent to Omaha with the war balloon, says that the balloon will be ready for exhibition in a few days.  The equipment will be installed on the north tract immediately south of the Transportation building and exhibitions will be given at regular hours.  The men who are in charge of the apparatus are fresh from the firing line before Santiago and the balloon itself bears numerous marks from Spanish bullets.</p>
                            <p>An Omaha critic says that one of "Trilby's" legs is longer than it really ought to be.  Be that as it may "Trilby" is "getting there with both feet" and crowds are daily visiting this production.  It is without doubt the most wonderful and beautiful work of art ever placed upon exhibition.  The owner of "Trilby" is under lasting obligations to the "critic" for the interest she has awakened and also for the public to see how much in error she was.</p>

                            <p>Efforts are now being bent double by the exposition management to make government day, Tuesday, a big success.  There will be a big delegation of senators and representatives, the very man who stood by the exposition and fought through a $200,000 appropriation bill during the closing days of the Fifty-fourth congress, and made possible the great success the exposition is enjoying.  And later they worked through a $40,000 appropriation for the Indian congress, which is now the largest aggregation of Indians of various tribes ever gotten together in America, and is one of the liveliest features today.  So in appreciation of this, the exposition is tendering the courtesies of government day to the visiting nobles, and is asking friends in Omaha to turn out and bid them welcome.</p>
                            <p>Of the committee of fifteen senators appointed by the vice president to represent the senate on this occasion, seven at least will be present.  They are William V.

Senator Vest has telegraphed from Tarpon Springs, Mo., of his illness which will prevent his presence, and Senator Bacon of Georgia has telegraphed his regrets at his inability to be present.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TURNING EAGLE SORRY.</head>
                            <p>Turning Eagle, an old Brule Sioux fighter from Rosebud agency, is awfully sorry that the Indians had a sham battle on the exposition grounds last evening, for it was so real to him that he is nursing a large powder burned hole in his face.  An angered enemy from the allied tribes of the south just simply stuck the muzzle of his carbine in Turning Eagle's face, pulled the trigger, and the blank cartridge did the rest.  There is a fearful danger from these Springfield blank cartridges at the range of a few inches.</p>
                            <p>The battle began by each tribe, arrayed in feathers, a bargain store remnant around the body, and a buttonless coat of gaudy paint filling in the blank spaces, riding up to the grand stand, being introduced as a whole, and each of its chiefs being pointed out.  Old Geronimo went up with his Apache band and stood the test of an introduction, and then withdrew to a seat among the spectators.</p>
                            <p>Then the six tribes of Sioux, the Arapahoes, Cheyennes and Crows pulled off to make ready for fight.  Very soon the Apaches, Kiowas, Comanches, Wichitas, Poncas, Omahas, Winnebagoes, Sacs, Foxes, and all the other allied tribes captured a Sioux scout, and proceeded to make a pan roast out of him while they amused him by holding a war dance about the electric light pole to which he was tied.  Other Sioux scouts discovered what was up, and returning to report, caused an immediate and ferocious attack to be made by the Sioux and their friends, who dismounted as they went into battle.  They drove the allied tribes to cover in the west side of the grounds, but after getting their southern friends, the enemy, in a corner, wished they hadn't.</p>
                            <p>The allied tribes rallied under the leadership of Jim Blackbird, Standing Brave, Red Fox and other noted warrior chiefs, and rebounding on the Sioux, ingloriously drove them from the field, and then returned to their camp to celebrate the victory by shooting away all of the ammunition they had left, much to the sorrow of the people who had furnished it and expected to have some left over for the next battle.</p>
                            <p>Nearly 500 Indians were engaged altogether.</p>

                            <p>Iowa day, the coming Wednesday, is fated to be one of the liveliest events of the exposition.  Prospects are that there will be a wholesale outpouring of Western Iowans, with liberal delegations from all over the state and every county represented by at least one band.</p>
                            <p>Canada is becoming much interested in the exposition, and wants a day set aside as Canadian day, not only for the 2,000 Canadian residents of the city, but for several officials of the government and citizens of the provinces who are appealing for special railroad rates for an occasion of the kind.  Mr. M. A. Hall, the British vice-consul, who was so successful in inducing the dominion government to make a large display, has urged the exposition management to take up the matter and, if possible, complete the required arrangements and fix one day of peace jubilee week for the coveted event.</p>

                            <p>Two big was balloons and the bevy of little balloons, which have been standing on the railroad tracks, in the cars, for over a week past, since their arrival from Montauk Point, will be unloaded today.  The squabble about who is to pay the freight has been settled by Uncle Sam paying it, and Captain Yancey has been given authority to go ahead and make all necessary arrangements.  The site selected is just north of the war cyclorama on West Midway, and east of the Transportation building.  It is anticipated that the generating plant will be completed, and balloons will be floating by the end of this week.  Captain Yancey and twenty-three men are here to do the work.  This display forms a part of the war department exhibit, in charge of Major Ward.</p>
                            <p>Advices have been received by Major Ward that the war department has sent to the exposition a large Spanish flag taken from the Spanish converted cruiser Mexico, in the harbor of Santiago on the day of its surrender to General Shafter, July 17.  Also the war balloon used in active service on the fire line about Santiago, and shot into pieces by Mauser bullets; the lay figure of a cavalryman of the late war, dressed in khaki uniform, and four brass cannon and a box of Mauser rifles captured from the Spanish at Santiago.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday was Children's day at the exposition, and thousands of little folk enjoyed the wonderful sights in the buildings and along the Midway.  But the merriest children were those in a party headed by Mr. Frank B. Hibbard of Union precinct.  Some days ago the World-Herald noted the fact that Mr. Hibbard had arranged to take all the school children of Union precinct to the exposition at his own expense, and yesterday was the day when the plan was carried to a successful consummation.</p>
                            <p>It was an ideal day, not too warm, but just warm enough, and the 300 children from Union precinct enjoyed it to the fullest extent.  And Mr. Hibbard enjoyed it all as much as any child in the party.  The knowledge of the pleasure he was giving to the little folk was ample reward for him, for Mr. Hibbard rejoices in making the little ones happy.</p>
                            <p>Provision had been made to transport the little ones from their school houses in Union, and they came in wagons, carriages, on bicycles and in the trolley cars, shouting with glee and with faces beaming in expectation of the good time in store for them.  The entire party was taken into the grounds through the Emmett street gate, and then they scattered, with the admonition to be at the Nebraska building at 12 m. sharp for lunch.  They were all there, shouting, laughing, singing and enjoying themselves to the full measure.  The World-Herald had provided a substantial lunch for the crowd, and with the assistance of several kind friends, including the officials in charge of the Nebraska building, the little folk were speedily served with sandwiches, pie and milk.  With a chatter that was almost deafening, but thoroughly enjoyed by the people who thronged the building to learn the cause of the commotion, the little folk demolished the lunch.  When the last sandwich had disappeared a manly little fellow stepped to the stage and proposed three cheers for the World-Herald.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIBBARD?</head>
                            <p>With a vim that almost cracked the huge dome the great cheer went up from the throats of 300 boys and girls, and the three cheers were ended with a "tiger" that was the climax of enthusiasm.  Just then Mr. Hibbard appeared on the scene, and the pandemonium that reigned was something wonderful.</p>
                            <p>"What's the matter with Frank Hibbard?" queried the small boy, full of milk and pie and enthusiasm, and with a roar that shook the building to its foundations came the reply:</p>
                            <p>"He's all right!"</p>
                            <p>"Who's all right?"</p>
                            <p>"Frank Hibbard!  'Rah!  'Rah!!  'Rah!!!"</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hibbard blushed like a school girl and bowed his acknowledgments, but the little folks kept up the shout until fairly exhausted.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hibbard then announced that the party would form in line and march to the Horticultural building, where each would receive a sack of grapes and a peach.  With more cheers the party started and swarmed past the grape and peach distributors, shouting for Mr. Hibbard, the World-Herald, the managers of the grape distribution and for the exposition.  Then the line formed again, and headed by Mr. Hibbard and marshaled by perspiring but happy aids, started down the Midway.  The merry party attracted much attention and was repeatedly cheered, each being answered with a will.  The first attraction on the Midway visited was the Wild West.  J. E. Shepard, one of Mr. Hibbard's neighbors, paid the little ones' way into this show.  Every act on the program was greeted with wild and approving applause, and the half dozen boys who rode in the old stage coach were attacked by Indians and rescued by the brave scouts and cowboys, were the proudest boys that ever visited the exposition.  The orator of the Wild West announced that one of the cowboys would give an exhibition of riding a bucking broncho, and when it was announced that the broncho's name was "World-Herald" some strong lunged lad shouted:  "'Rah for World-Herald, both of 'em!" and the cheers were emphatic and heartfelt.</p>
                            <p>The management of the Libbey glass blowers allowed his generosity to combine with the generosity of Mr. Hibbard, and, after the Wild West performance, the party was crowded in and watched with interest the work of the glass blowers.</p>

                            <p>Then the generosity of Mr. Hibbard paired off with the liberality of the management of the Edison wargraph, and the 300 little folk were taken in to see the bombardment of Fort Matanzas and other pictures.  The marching troops were cheered, the bull fighters were cheered, the Maine was cheered, the Vesuvius was cheered&#8212;in fact, everything was cheered&#8212;and the little folk were delighted with the splendid exhibition.  The Ostrich Farm was next visited, and the huge but handsome birds were watched with great interest.  The management of the Ostrich Farm left nothing undone to make the visit of the little folk pleasant, and the memory of the ostriches will remain in 300 minds as long as life shall last.</p>
                            <p>The Indian encampment was visited, and here the little people went wild with delight.  Even the stoical old Indians smiled at the enthusiasm of the children, and the pappooses grinned approvingly at their palefaced companions in childhood.  Special pains were taken to show the children the different phases of Indian life, and the Indian camp will never be forgotten.  It was a wonderful object lesson.</p>

                            <p>The children were then marched, cheering and shouting, down to the grand court to witness the exhibition of the life saving crew.  This was the climax of the day's entertainment.  The children saw the exhibition with an interest that was wonderful to see, and when the lifeboat rescued the drowning man the 300 little Americans whooped and cheered with approval that made the crew feel good.</p>
                            <p>After this entertainment the little folk scattered to take in the exposition under direction of their teachers and parents.  Three hours were spent in this manner, and spend to good advantage, and at 7:30 the children were gathered and sent home.  As they passed out of the gates they cheered Mr. Hibbard until that gentleman felt like escaping the admiration of his little friends.  Then they cheered the World-Herald and the exposition, their teachers and their schools, and with throats fairly sore from cheering, they started homeward, happy as children can be.</p>
                            <p>And the happiest man in Omaha yesterday was Frank B. Hibbard.  And Mr. Hibbard's happiness was from the knowledge that he had made 300 little folk happy.  A man who can and does <unclear reason="torn"/>ght to be happy.</p>

                            <p>The Musical Critic of Chicago is so amusing in its wholesale denunciation of exposition music management that the following excerpts are made for the delectation of Omaha readers:</p>
                            <p>"Mr. Kimball was a thoroughly incompetent man for the position, and simply rattled around like a marble in a milk pail.  Putting Mr. Kelly in his place was the most available thing that could be done under the circumstances.  He is bright and quick, but his opportunities for thorough study have been extremely limited.  The writer is reliably informed that Mr. Kelly is frequently not consulted at all as to the musical features.  Glance behind the throne, and you will see that Mr. Kelly is but a mere figurehead (like his predecessor.")</p>
                            <p>To call Mr. Kelly a mere figurehead will be full of humor to those who know his ability for directing and managing.  But the Critic was not satisfied with giving him and Kimball a slap.  It then proceeds to demolish Mr. Lindsey and Mrs. Officer:  "Why do the moneyed men of Omaha who are backing this enterprise allow Mr. Lindsey to run this department in the interest of his friend, Miss Officer (who knows little, if anything, about music), to have a 'cinch' in employing talent?"</p>
                            <p>After which it gives this side blow at a band secured for the exposition during the last regime:</p>
                            <p>"'United States band,' or whatever name it assumes now, I don't know, but is known in Chicago as a street band and a band whom dame fortune is always gazing at with google eyes, did not retrieve its many misfortunes of past years by appearing as a concert organization of the exposition.  The director may be all right blowing a trumpet on horseback, but as a director of a concert (?) band, I do believe he is a failure.  There must be a hoodoo and a lack of doodoo in his organization called for courtesy's sake a band.  Such a conglomeration of sound by such an aggregation of star (?) performers I sincerely hope will never again&#8212;no never&#8212;be thrust upon an Omaha audience.  I hope the exposition management will have this band in attendance at the Indian convention, for there it will be in its sphere&#8212;glory as it were&#8212;playing the lovely accompaniment to the ghost, snake and other dances so charmingly musical to the intelligent Caucasian race."</p>
                            <p>This paper is the same that even criticised the performances of the Thomas orchestra when in Omaha.</p>

                            <p>German day will be October 18 instead of October 7.  The change was made at the request of the exposition management and was decided on at a joint meeting of local German societies held in Turner hall yesterday.  The date is the Tuesday following Jubilee week and this fact is expected to largely increase the attendance.  The day is also the anniversary of the battle of Leipsic, at which Germany was freed from Napoleon's rule, and this, too, will serve to attract many people of German nativity to the city to celebrate the event.</p>
                            <p>There was a big attendance at the meeting.  Sixteen German societies of this city and South Omaha were represented.  These agreed to furnish a dozen floats and five bands for the parade.  The meeting organized permanently by electing Frederick Krug president, Rudolph Neack, treasurer, and Dr. Adler, secretary.  An executive committee was appointed to arrange all the details of the celebration.</p>
                            <p>There will be another joint meeting of the societies to make arrangements to get German societies outside Omaha to take part in the plan.  The executive committee will hold a meeting Tuesday night.</p>

                            <p>Wyoming day is another of those euphonious terms that fill space on a program without materially inflating the gate receipts.  Inasmuch as the state has been decidedly backward in its support of the exposition Governor Richards decided that it was not worth while to celebrate the occasion, and there is nothing to distinguish it but the informal attendance of a few Wyoming people.  The absence of the contemplated exercises have no appreciable effect on the general attendance and there is as good a crowd as is expected on Monday.</p>
                            <p>The only remaining feature for today is the opening of the poultry exhibit that is the beginning of the big live stock show that will be put on in its entirety early in October.  Three of the big barns that have recently been erected south of the Indian encampment have been devoted to the display of blooded cocks and hens and by tomorrow the show will be in full swing.  Superintendent Lewellyn says the quality of the display will exceed anything that has been previously shown in Nebraska.  The buff breeds are exceptionally well represented and there are especially good showings of brown leghorns and light brahmas.  The birds are coming in constantly today and are being rapidly installed.  As yesterday was Sunday a large proportion of the work of installation remained to be done today and it is not likely that the show will be thrown open for general inspection before tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>What promises to be the biggest week of the exposition so far was inaugurated yesterday by the best Sunday crowd that has yet been on the grounds.  The 25-cent rate and the magnificent weather brought the people out in unusual numbers and the grounds presented as lively a scene as on an ordinary week day.  For the first three hours of the afternoon the travel towards the grounds was limited only by the capacity of the street cars and later the evening attendance swelled the crowd to even more satisfactory proportions.  It was a thoroughly delightful day for exposition visiting and the afternoon and evening were occupied by an almost continuous program of excellent band music that afforded entertainment to those who found the sun too vigorous for walking about the grounds.  The Mexican band played to big audiences at each of its concerts and the Omaha Concert band gave Auditorium concerts at 1 and 5 o'clock which were also liberally patronized.</p>

                            <p>Special Agent McGarvie returned yesterday from Chicago with the most satisfactory assurances that Chicago day, which occurs October 1, will be one of the marked successes of the exposition.  The city will send one of the most representative crowds that has ever gone out of Chicago and it now appears that the local peace celebration will have no serious effect on the excursions to Omaha.  Mr. McGarvie says that there is no doubt that from 5,000 to 10,000 people will come from Chicago alone and these will include the most prominent business and social organizations of the city.

                            <p>The famous democratic marching club of Cook county will fill another big special and although the Cook county republican club will not attend as an organization about 300 of its members have signified their intention to come as individuals.  The Marquette club, the Chicago Athletic club, the Germania club and one or two others will attend as organizations and with the crowd of general excursionists that will accompany these organized bodies the indications are that all the Chicago-Omaha lines will have all the business they can handle.  The celebration on the grounds will be quite a notable event.  The arrangements for speakers are in charge of Chairman W. H. Harper of the executive committee of the Illinois commission and he announces that among others Mayor Harrison, Senator Mason, Congressman Mann and Charles G. Dawes, comptroller of the currency, will deliver addresses.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Program for the Week.</head>
                            <p>This week's exposition program includes a number of events of more than ordinary importance and several of them are calculated to bring in big crowds to add to the regular attendance.  With the favorable weather that present conditions indicate it should result in an aggregate attendance for the week that will far exceed all previous records.</p>
                            <p>As previously announced the Wyoming day celebration today has been abandoned on account of the inability of Governor Richards and other state officers to attend.  But the absence of formal exercises will not prevent a greater or less number of Wyoming people from taking advantage of the very favorable railroad rates that have been secured for the occasion.  The Nebraska Poultry association will also meet in Omaha today and this will bring in quite a crowd of fanciers from this and adjacent states.</p>
                            <p>Tuesday will be signalized by the presence of a large party of United States senators and representatives and the exercises of the day will be made notable by the participation of a number of the most celebrated orators of both houses.</p>
                            <p>The celebration of Iowa day Wednesday is expected to bring one of the biggest crowds that has yet attended the exposition.  The interest of Iowa in the enterprise is only second to that of Nebraska and elaborate preparations have been made for securing an immense representation of Cornhuskers.  Very low railroad rates have been secured and extensively advertised and the railroads and the Iowa commissioners have united to work up an interest that prevails over the entire state.  It is said that pretty nearly every town in Iowa has arranged to send an excursion to Omaha and the railroads unite in declaring that it will merely be a question of how many people they can haul.  The exercises of the day will be exceptionally interesting and it will be a red letter day in every respect.</p>
                            <p>Thursday will also be a day of more than ordinary interest and the participation of the Modern Woodmen of America will bring in a big crowd of members of the order.  As a large number of the Iowa visitors will also remain over there is every reason to expect a tremendous crowd and some special features will be provided by the management in addition to the formal celebration, which is in charge of the local lodges of Woodmen.  On the same day the Burlington will bring in a big excursion from Warren county, Illinois, and its reports indicate that it will be well patronized.</p>
                            <p>Another excursion from Illinois is booked for Friday.  This is from Quincy, where a good deal of interest has been manifested.  The beginning of the Choral congress will also add a very interesting feature to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The final celebration of the week will be that of the commercial travelers, which occurs Saturday.  So far no definite information has been received relative to the prospective attendance nor the extent of the celebration.  But the matter is being actively worked up and the presence of the drummers will probably be marked by a number of unique features in the way of entertainment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Indians Depose Person Who Has Been Setting Terpsichorean Peace.</head>
                            <p>His-Horse-Looking will not lead the Indian dances any more.  People who have seen this Indian bounce into the arena, his black hair hanging down his back and then set the pace for his associates will miss him in the future.  Black Eagle, another Indian, will take his place.</p>
                            <p>The displacement of His-Horse-Looking came about in this way.  When the dances were started His-Horse-Looking boomed his candidacy and succeeded in convincing the other Indians that he was the best dancer in the camp.  For a month he set the pace and did the spieling, but of late there had been some dissatisfaction, more than one Indian venturing the opinion that the old man is not quite on to the curves of the latest dances.</p>
                            <p>Black Eagle is an ambitious Indian and when he hear the complaints that had been lodged against His-Horse-Looking he concluded to test his popularity and at once set about to get the place for himself.  He circulated among the lodges and buttonholed the Indians, declaring that at a number of the dances on the reservation he had won bouquets and that at a cake walk he had not only carried off the cake, but in addition had taken the entire bakery.  This way he worked up a feeling against His-Horse-Looking and it was pretty generally understood that the old man would have to resign or retire.  This information was conveyed to him and he at once declared that he would not resign, as he is not of the resigning kind.  However, he offered to make a concession and let the Indians decided whether he should get out or stay.  Such a plan suited everybody and it was decided to hold an election.  Black Eagle seemed to be the most promising candidate and after visiting all of the lodges he returned to the council and said that he would win in a canter.</p>
                            <p>This all occurred Saturday night and the head men of the camp, after comparing notes, decided to hold the election yesterday afternoon.  Frank Carry-Kettle, Swift Dog and Wipes-His-Eyes were appointed judges and Three-Fingers and Kicking-Horse-Charley clerks of the election.  Instead of having a ballot box and a polling place the judges and clerks of election went from tepee to tepee, allowing the Indians to deposit their votes in Swift-Dog's hat.  After the voting the ballots were counted and it was ascertained that Black Eagle had won and that he had any number of votes to spare.</p>
                            <p>His-Horse-Looking took the defeat to heart, but he says that he will bide his time and that eventually he will down Black Eagle, whom he declares, never danced a fancy step until he came to the camp.</p>
                            <p>To celebrate the victory Black Eagle gave a little supper in his tepee last night.  It was attended by Kicking-Horse-Bill, Looks-up-in-the-Tree, Afraid-to-Stay-Out-Nights and half a dozen of the staunch supporters of the victorious Indian.  While the menu card did not contain a long list of delicacies, it enumerated such substantials as beef tongue, ox liver, army bread, prunes and rice.  After it had been discussed and after the health of Black Eagle had been drunk in Missouri river water and black coffee cigarettes were lighted and for a time tales of bravery were told, each Indian trying to outdo the other in telling what they did when they were boys.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Two Specialties Will Be Put on at the Encampment.</head>
                            <p>At 4 o'clock this afternoon the Crow dance will be given by the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians on the open space in front of the office building on the Indian grounds.  This dance is participated in by only these two tribes and is said to have received its inspiration from the ghost dance.  In dancing it the Indians chant prayers to their great father.  They pray for better times and a changed condition of affairs.  The peculiarity of this dance is that it is always put on before supper and the Indians participating are stripped to the paint and feathers.  The music is the drum.  Between seventy and 100 Indians will take part.</p>
                            <p>At 8 o'clock tonight the celebrated ghost dance will be put on for the first time.  It will be dance by between seventy-five and 125 Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Wichitas, Kiowas and Sioux.  This dance differs from all other Indian dances by reason of the fact that there is no music.  Of course, the Indians sing, but they discard the drum that is used in all of their other dances.  The feature of the ghost dance is the hypnotism that takes possession of the Indians.  After dancing for a time they go into a trance and fall upon the ground, where they remain motionless.  Eventually they get back upon this mundane sphere and then tell their friends tales of having been to the happy hunting grounds and holding conversations with friends and relatives who have gone before.  The experiences of the trip to the other side are told in a sing song tone, which obviates the necessity for music.</p>
                            <p>It has been supposed that the ghost dance is a hostile ceremony, but men who have made a study of Indians say not.  They contend that it is a dance that originated in Nevada and was finally brought over the range and adopted by numerous tribes.  Instead of being hostile in its character men who have made a study of Indian customs say that the dance is in the nature of a religious ceremony.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Letter from a Recent Visitors to an Omaha Friend Gives Endorsement.</head>
                            <p>The manner in which the exposition impresses the intelligent visitors is very pertinently indicated in a letter which S. W. Lindsey of this city received the other day from G. W. Barnett, a prominent Chicago commission merchant, who spent several days on the grounds some time ago.  Mr. Barnett says:</p>
                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/> that I was surprised is putting it exceedingly mildly; that the transmissouri states should have such a showing exceeded my expectations.  There is but one standard which the Chicagoan sets up for comparison in the matter of exhibition, which of course is the World's fair, yet every thoughtful and reasonable man will know that it is out of the question to expect on section of our country to rival that wonderful creation.  We had not only the great city of Chicago as a foundation, but we had the individual states as well as the general government and the assistance of the civilized world to make a record that possibly will never be exceeded.  In candor it cannot be expected that your exhibition will reach that in size.  Compared with other exhibitions of a like character, you may well feel proud of your success.</p>
                            <p>The excellence of the display of the general government; the surpassing beauty and extent of the agricultural display; the marked beauty and value of the horticultural exhibition; the excellence of the art exhibit, will appear to every thoughtful observer.  The classic beauty of the buildings, the artistic groupings of the various structures around one common center, the chaste design of the Arch of States and the Administrative Arch, the beauty of the Lagoon when lighted up so magnificently as it appears at night, is a veritable triumph that impresses itself on the eye and mind of every beholder.</p>
                            <p>Pardon these words of eulogy, but they are absolutely correct.  Personally, I feel a pride in the effort our own state has made, and the object lesson set in our beautiful state building, which appears to me to be the gem of all the state buildings, the quiet restfulness, the <choice><sic>unobstrusive</sic><corr>unobtrusive</corr></choice> elegance and homelike air pervading it, and the magnificent paintings of our own exhibition seems to me so worthy the great state of Illinois.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska did well and other states, too, were fine.  On the whole, I was more than pleased, and could have spent another day to good advantage in studying the exhibition as a whole and in detail.  One of the pleasant features is the matter of moderate charges of entertainment and I owe you my special thanks for the comfortable quarters you secured for me and the reasonable charges, as well as the polite and courteous attention.  I shall certainly advise my friends to visit the fair.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FRESH FRUIT ON DISPLAY TODAY.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exhibitors in the Horticultural Building Put Things in Shape.</head>
                            <p>The interior of the Horticultural building took on a neat and tasty appearance yesterday, all of the exhibitors devoting their time and energies to cleaning up and preparing for the rush that is coming this week.</p>
                            <p>In the Nebraska exhibit, the tables that had been occupied by the grapes and peaches, given away to the children last Saturday, were filled with new fruit, including apples, peaches, pears, plums and grapes, and there was nothing to indicate the condition that prevailed the day before.  The season has advanced to the point where from now until the close of the exposition Superintendent Youngers will show nothing but the best in the fruit line.  Exhibits are coming in in great quantities, which enables him to take his pick, accepting the best and rejecting everything else.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Lane, who looks after the interests of the exhibit from Otero county, Colorado, is in receipt of almost enough fruit to completely replenish his exhibit.  He is showing some of the biggest Elberta peaches ever seen in the building, together with samples of the Heath cling, which are almost as white as milk and are about as large as ordinary teacups.  Besides these he is filling his tables with apples, peaches, and plums.  The Garfield county exhibit, presided over by Superintendent Fravert, has been replenished by the addition of the big peaches that grow just over the backbone of the Rocky mountains.  They are very large, highly colored and of good flavor.  In addition he is putting out Alaskan crab apples, besides a dozen varieties of fall and winter apples.  The two Colorado counties are running neck and neck and each superintendent is doing his level best to outdo the other.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Driscoll of the Idaho exhibit has added very largely to his showing during the past few days and now has the state's space completely filled with as fine fruit as has ever been seen in this locality.  Recently he has received a large consignment of peaches, apples, grapes, plums and prunes.  The prunes that are attracting the most attention are the Americans, about as large as eggs and as black as ink.  They are of fine flavor and in the west are general favorites.</p>
                            <p>While not the Horticultural building the Dominion of Canada is putting in a very fine fruit exhibit in the International hall.  Most of the fruit comes from British Columbia and Ontario, furnishing pretty conclusive proof that these two provinces can raise all of the varieties grown in the states.  The exhibit now on the table contains numerous varieties of apples, peaches, pears and grapes, together with plums and prunes.</p>

                            <p>The plan of Superintendent Kelly to have a great choral congress in connection with the exposition during the current week has been practically abandoned.  The failure is said to be due to the inability to secure railroad rates that are satisfactory to the choral organizations whose participation is essential to make the congress a success.  When the matter was first suggested Superintendent Kelly was assured that a rate of 1 cent a mile would be granted to bring the choirs to the exposition.  This has not been done and most of the prospective participants refuse to pay any more.</p>

                            <p>The program for the celebration of Government day has been completed with the exception of one or two possible changes after the distinguished guests arrive.  The senatorial delegation will make its headquarters at the Millard hotel, from which it will be escorted to the grounds in carriages at 10:30 o'clock.

After adjournment the visitors will be entertained at lunch at the Markel cafe by the exposition management.  At 4 o'clock there will be an informal reception in front of the Government building in connection with the life saving drill and an hour later there will be a sham battle at the Indian encampment.  At 7 o'clock the senators will be the guests of the Iowa commissioners at dinner at the Omaha club and there will be a fireworks display in the evening.  This is the Auditorium program:</p>

                            <p>One big cake walk was announced to be the specialty of the evening at 11:30 last night at the German Village.  The Old Plantation claims to have an exclusive privilege on cake walks, and protested to the exposition management.  The guards were <choice><sic>order</sic><corr>ordered</corr></choice> to stop the cake walk.  An appeal was made to the city police and a detail was there to preserve order should Commander Llewellyn with his score of guards in waiting and the Villagers fall out.  The time came, the big white cake was placed on the stage and a row of chairs adorned the rear wall.  Preparations were largely apparent.  Commander Llewellyn stepped upon the stage and announced that the cake walk had been postponed.  A Villager of portly <choice><sic>mein</sic><corr>mien</corr></choice> immediately followed with the regrets of the Village that plans had been interfered with, and hoped that their many, many friends wouldn't be disappointed again.  Then a colored citizen with shiny silk tile, Prince Albert coat and big boutonniere kicked up such a dust in his only great dance that further demonstrations were hidden.</p>

                            <p>Nebraska has fully proven her position as a grape growing district of country.  Never in the history of the state has there been presented to the public such testimony of production in the line of fruits, and never has there been such a free and lavish distribution of our soil products made in evidence of our acquired wealth and standing in any line of production.</p>
                            <p>The idea of a fruit festival day at the exposition, its influence and effect, from an advertising standpoint, has been clearly set forth by Mr. Youngers and his associates in Nebraska fruit growing interests in their effort in "Nebraska grape day."</p>
                            <p>Grape day, originally planned by the fruit festival enterprise, was to be participated in by all the Trans-Mississippi states; the tax upon each would then be light in furnishing entertainment for the visitors.  But as grape day approached the evidence of a lack of interest became more apparent, and Nebraska's fruit growers, who know no such thing as failure in any undertaking in their line of work, took upon themselves the responsibility of carrying grape day before the visitors at the exposition, and not only fulfilled to the entire satisfaction this obligation for the day assigned, but made a two days' festival and turned no one away without a package of Nebraska grown grapes, notwithstanding there were recorded on these two days an attendance of 35,300.</p>
                            <p>The grapes which were used on this occasion to represent Nebraska's producing ability in this line of fruit were grown by Robert W. Furnas of Nemaha county, Marshall Bros. of Washington county, C. H. Barnard of Jefferson county; Phillip Mergen, F. R. Martin and Mr. Hoffman of Douglas county.</p>
                            <p>As to the extent of grape growing in Nebraska, Mr. Youngers reports that grapes in quantities can be had in dozens of vineyards in various parts of the state.  Offers of ten and twelve tons were made by individual growers for the Nebraska grape day festival.</p>

                            <p>Mr. James Mooney, representing the bureau of ethnology, who arrived with the last detachment of southern Indians, the Apaches, Wichitas, Kiowas, Cheyennes and Arapahoes, is making arrangements for bringing into prominence these novelties of Indian life, as his own observations as an ethnologist for several years have brought out and as the <choice><sic>researches</sic><corr>researchers</corr></choice> of the bureau of ethnology have shown.  The program in contemplation will suffice to keep the Indian village a center of excitement till the exposition closes, introducing fresh features almost daily.  Seating and lighting capacities are being increased to accommodate the constantly increasing crowds at all such events and to give the Indians pin money from the sale of seats.</p>

                            <head type="sub">REAL GHOST DANCE.</head>
                            <p>The first ghost dance ever given in a civilized community will be on the boards at 8 o'clock tonight&#8212;not the hopping around an electric light designated as a war dance&#8212;but the real ghost dance, led by the famous ghost dancers of the last Sioux Indian war, the survivors of Wounded Knee.  Along with the Sioux will be the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Wichitas, Kiowas.  Seventy to 100 will participate.</p>
                            <p>In tracing the history of the ghost dance Mr. Mooney find that it originated in Nevada twelve years ago, the dream of an Indian prophet.  From there the dance, with its weird doctrines, spread rapidly eastward till adopted by every tribe of the plains from the Missouri to the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Mr. Mooney declares that this dance is not a hostile movement, since no weapons are carried, nor are there any songs suggestive of the war path.  By its strange character, he says, the white interpreted the frenzied actions of the Sioux to be a war dance and took the initiative which really brought about the war.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">SVENGALIS AMONG THEM.</head>
                            <p>At all events the dance differs from all other Indian dances in that no musical instruments are used.  The men, women and sometimes children join hands and circle about, singing religious hymns and prayers to the protecting power of the Indians, lamentations for the good old times and petitions to join the Indians who have gone before.  All the time the fantastically garbed medicine men in the center of the circle use all their uncanny influence with the fierce steps and frenzied songs of those in the moving circle to bring them under the hypnotic influence essential to the success of the dance.  One by one the Indians fall unconscious, dead to the world in a seemingly terrible trance, in which they remain from thirty minutes to two hours, recovering apparently as fresh as when they entered the dance.  Sometimes a dozen Indians are overcome by the hypnotic influences abounding.</p>
                            <p>While in these trances the Indians aver that they have visions in which they converse with relatives and friends who are dead and gone to the spirit land.  Upon the words of the dead is placed great weight, and at the next ghost dance the stories of the visions are related in song.</p>
                            <p>No alarm need be felt by the spectators, Mr. Mooney says, over the Indians who have gone into trances or over any of the actions of the Indians for, like a fairy story, all will come out well in the last chapter.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">CROW DANCE SOMETHING NEW.</head>
                            <p>This afternoon at 4 o'clock another characteristic dance will be given, the Crow dance, peculiar only to the Cheyennes and Arapahos, and an inspiration from the ghost dance.  The Crow dance must be held before supper, however, and never after dark.  The dance includes a series of musical chants, accompanied by the drum, in the Arapahoe language, and directed to "Hesunani" or the great father of those particular Indians.  They are laments for the present unhappy conditions of the tribes and prayers for the return of the days gone by.</p>
                            <p>The men are stripped down to the seashore bathing suit order, with bodies richly painted and highly adorned with elaborate feather ornamentation.  The women are sumptuously dressed in buckskin suits, and altogether it is a swell sartorial treat.  In many points this dance is said to resemble the ghost dance and in others the old dance of the Omahas.</p>

                            <p>Nebraska's horticultural display in the Horticultural building, so richly enjoyed last week, has given way to an entirely new collection of Nebraska fruits, the cream of this year's crop.  There are over seventy varieties of apples, plums, peaches, grapes, pears and a fine collection of paw-paws from ex-Governor Furnas' Nemaha county farm.  To give variety to the <choice><sic>dislay</sic><corr>display</corr></choice>, bunches of buckeyes in their bursting shells are distributed about.  The magnificent grape vines laden with bunches of grapes, which were a part of last week's decorations, have been left.  The most remarkable contribution of apples is said to be a quantity of Pound Sweets from Isaac Pollard's Cass county farm, something that is attracting the attention of fruit growers.</p>

                            <p>The exposition fire department responded to a false alarm of fire, turned in about dark last evening, from somewhere among the state buildings.</p>
                            <p>James Blackhawk and Little Ox, jr., Winnebagoes, and Pretty Bird and Medicine Top, Crows, were a bevy of Indians jailed by the exposition guards last night for having in their possession a half filled whisky bottle, minus the cork.  The idea was to find the man who gave it to them, Jim Blackhawk<unclear reason="torn"/> council of the braves will be held today to settle the preliminaries of the engagement.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday was a balmy day on the exposition grounds and a fair crowd was the result of the fine weather and the 25 cent rate, the number present being 13,624, a total to date of 1,404,840.</p>

                            <p>The finest of fine weather, with only faint premonitions of an approaching storm; the added zest supplied by the previous postponement of an event which has been eagerly anticipated; banks and clouds of flowers, artificial in fact, but real to outward seeming; and the hearty co&#246;peration of all hands to the same end under the supervision of one experienced head; all these, and other factors, too numerous and individually too small to mention, combined to make Omaha's first flower parade an occasion so entirely successful and so thoroughly enjoyable that it will be strange if others do not follow it in years to come.  Paper flowers are seldom out of season, blooming hardily all the year round.  A display like last Friday's would add lustre even to the October parades of Ak-Sar-Ben, and, happening on the afternoon of any day devoted to the public acclaim of that monarch, would attract as much attention as any other feature of the pomp and circumstance amid which he commonly mounts his twelve-months' throne.</p>
                            
                            <p>The attendance at the exposition grounds on Friday of last week was among the largest registered by the turnstiles since the show was opened.  Low rates and a strong attraction brought about this result, as they will again whenever they are allowed to act in concert.  The sun was warm enough to make the shady places preferable to the open glare, yet not so ardent as to wilt down collars and ruin dainty toilets.  There was more than a suspicion of dust, borne up on the southern breeze, but the rain-clouds gathering in the north gave welcome promise of relief during the night to come.  Along the Bluff Tract, from the band-stand southward to the vicinity of the Georgia Building, were to be seen, here and there, in various stages of preparation, the flower-decked vehicles and horses which were to take part in the parade.  Some were ready at all points, and had already taken their places in the forming line; in other, gaily caparisoned steeds were proudly suffering themselves to be attached to carriages which outshone the sun, and the least of which Solomon in all his glory never approached; and yet others still reposed on the trucks which had brought them immaculate to the grounds.  A mass of expectant humanity filled the graveled walks and drives, swarmed upon the twin porches of the Iowa Building, gather in the shade of the trees, crowded the north steps of the Apple and Orange Building and occupied every seat in the band stand, where the judges sat to award the prizes.  They were all mayors, these judges, and consequently well fitted to arbitrate a flower parade; and the balmy southern wind, which shook out the flags and pennants everywhere blew through their hirsute facial adornments with apparently equal relish.</p>
                            
                            <p>Shortly after the time appointed&#8212;only a very little; commendably prompt, as an onlooking man said, for a parade of women&#8212;the mounted aids who had been galloping about briskly withdrew themselves into the region back of the Horticultural Building where the procession was forming; and presently a burst of band music and a simultaneous rush of the people in the direction whence it sounded, proclaimed that the great display was at last to be seen.  Round the east end of the building it came, General Manager Clarkson, always gallant and brave, riding ahead and managing his restive horse with the skill and grace of a veteran soldier.  Following him marched the Phinney band, and next the Ak-Sar-Ben governors, mounted, their tasteful uniforms and martial bearing testifying, as ever, to the dignity and might of their sovereign.  These preliminary features, however, imposing as they were, did not seek, and would have failed if they had, to hold the attention.  For behind them, as far as the eye might reach among the tortuous paths, came the most wonderful, the most novel, the most beautiful pageant ever seen in Omaha.</p>
                            
                            <p>At the head of the line, perhaps by virtue of his official position, and with certainly as valid a claim as anyone's to lead, with such an equipage, a procession of brilliant equipages, came the handsome carriage of President Gurdon W. Wattles, of the exposition.  The prevailing color was pink, the flowers being entirely American beauty roses.  President Wattles himself drove, and with him in the trap were Mrs. Wattles, Mrs. George F. Bidwell and Mrs. Charles Ogden, all of whom wore dainty toilets of organdie with large hats trimmed in roses to conform to the general scheme of decoration.</p>
                            <p>Looming above its companion vehicles, and attracting attention even in the distance, was Mr. Al Patrick's tally-ho coach, adorned in the national colors, wrought in stripes of peonies and rhododendrons.  The top and interior of the coach were further materially decorated by the presence of a dozen young women, all in tailor gowns of white, white sailor hats and parasols of the patriotic colors.  Miss May Dundy shared the driver's seat with Mr. Patrick; and other guests were Mrs. Arthur Remington, Mrs. W. A. Redick, Mrs. D. H. Wheeler, Jr., Mrs. E. H. Sprague, Mrs. Johnson of St. Paul, and Mrs. Warren Rogers, and Miss Grace Allen, Miss Mabel Taylor, Miss Chandler, Miss Jeannie Brown, Miss Wood and Miss Marshall of Lincoln.</p>
                            
                            <p>The contribution of the Misses Sharp to this composite scene of loveliness was a spider phaeton drawn by a white horse,&#8212;the whole dainty equipage, from front to rear, decked out in purest white.  Harness, whip, decorative roses, the dresses, hats and gloves of the occupants, everything except the sooty visage of the little Ethiopian tiger perched up behind was white, and a murmur of admiration followed the turn-out wherever it went.</p>
                            <p>A strikingly beautiful picture was made by Mrs. Joslyn's victoria, which was driven by a coachman in livery, and was decorated with the utmost taste.  Harness and wheels were in white poppies, and the body of the carriage was completely concealed from view with poppies of red, several thousands of flowers having been employed to accomplish the splendid result.  Mrs. Joslyn's gown, parasol and hat were of white, the flowers being used with fine decorative effect; Mrs. Clement Chase, who shared the carriage with her, was also in white, with a Gainsborough hat and a parasol trimmed entirely with red and white poppies.  This turn-out was unquestionably one of the most tasteful and striking in the line.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Thomas W. Taliaferro's carriage was another symphony in white, the decorations being of roses and Easter lilies.  The horse's hoofs were gilded, as were also those of several other horses in the parade.  Mrs. Paul Charlton accompanied Mrs. Taliaferro, and both ladies were attired throughout in white.  Many named this equipage, as it passed, as the winner of one of the prizes.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. J. E. Baum drove a trap in which were Mrs. David Baum, Mrs. Charles L. Burr of Lincoln and Miss Sadie Baum.  The decorations of this handsome vehicle were in three shades of yellow poppies and asparagus.  A canopy top was similarly adorned, and the ladies were dressed in white, with large black hats, trimmed, like the vehicle itself, with yellow poppies.</p>
                            
                            <p>The victoria occupied by Mrs. Henry T. Clarke and Miss Clarke produced one of the swellest effects of the entire parade.  No attempt was made to bury and conceal the polished black wood of the vehicle, the contrast to the white chrysanthemums used in decoration being conspicuously rich and elegant.  The spirited team being likewise coal-black, both contrast and effect were preserved there as well.  The ladies were in white, with white parasols, and carried real flowers.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Freeman P. Kirkendall's turnout was among the handsomest in the parade, being a trap beautifully decorated with blue corn flowers and oats, the combination being in the highest degree appropriate and effective.  With Mrs. Kirkendall were Miss Nellie Baum, Miss Flora Burgert and Miss Ada Kirkendall, and the costumes were white, with parasols trimmed to match the carriage.</p>
                            <p>Mr. James L. Paxton held the lines over a pair of horses attached to the landau of Miss Elizabeth Allen, in which rode also Mrs. Frank Bishop and Miss Reichel.  The equipage was profusely and tastefully decorated with yellow chrysanthemums, and the general effect of the toilets was white, making an agreeable contrast and a decidedly effective display.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Downs drove one of the daintiest of all the vehicles,&#8212;a trap in red and white roses, made especially noticeable by the artistic use of long grasses in combination with the flowers in the adornment of the wheels.  Mrs. Downs was accompanied by Mrs. H. W. Pennock, and both ladies were attired in white.</p>
                            
                            <p>Next came the elegant carriage of Mrs. J. N. Cornish, overlaid with thousands of chrysanthemums in three shades of purple, driven by a man in livery, and occupied by Miss Fanny Cole, Miss Fayette Cole and Miss Louise Doherty.  The toilets were of white, set off with lavender, and much admiration was expressed, throughout the course of the parade, at the handsome display.</p>
                            <p>A gorgeous and striking effect in pink and green was furnished by the high English cart of Mr. and Mrs. George W. Mercer, which was beautifully adorned with La France roses, rose foliage, smilax, and green ribbons.  The scheme of decoration was carried out upon the horses, which were hung with rose garlands and long sprays of smilax.  Miss Mercer of Omaha, and Miss Davidson of Bay City, Mich., shared the vehicle with Mr. and Mrs. Mercer, Mrs. Mercer being attired in pink, Miss Mercer in green, and Miss Davidson in pink.</p>
                            <p>That the popular superstition regarding the number thirteen should seem to receive new confirmation during so beneficent an event as a flower parade was hardly to have been expected, and still less might the exemplification of it have been looked for in the case of the chairwoman of the committee herself, who has given her time and best energies for weeks to make the festival the success it is universally conceded to have been.  Nevertheless, as the equipage of Mrs. Thomas M. Orr passed the reviewing stand, one of the horses leaped over the pole, causing some little damage and a vast deal of commotion.  Order was soon restored, however, and the handsome turn-out resumed its place in the line.  It was a cabriolet drawn by two magnificent horses, and the decorations were of pink poppies with black centres against a background of blue.  Mrs. Orr and Mrs. O. S. Hoffman were in white, and Mrs. C. E. Squires wore a charming toilet of black and white.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Howard Baldrige's tandem, occupied by herself and by Mrs. Richard Carrier, was the cynosure of all eyes so long as it remained in sight, partly by reason of its being the only vehicle of that nature in the parade, and largely because of its own individual attractiveness.  The decorations were pink poppies and smilax, employed artistically and in profusion, and liveried attendants led the horses.  Mrs. Baldrige and Mrs. Carrier were gowned alike in red, a hue which will set off their contrasting styles of loveliness.  Their turn-out was a favorite all along the line and was generally considered a likely prize-winner.</p>
                            
                            <p>A lovely effect of cream roses was afforded by the carriage of Mr. and Mrs. S. A. McWhorter, which was elaborately bedecked with those delicate flowers, contrasted with streamers of scarlet ribbon.  In the vehicle were Mr. and Mrs. McWhorter, Miss Lydia Moore and Masters Gardner and Donald McWhorter, the last named, in a brilliant uniform, making a bright dash of color among the dainty white toilets of the others.  Masters Huch McWhorter and James Fair, in fetching costumes, acted as outriders.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Stanhope driven by Mrs. Guckert was strikingly decorated in burnt orange chrysanthemums.  Mrs. Guckert
                            
                            <pb n="198" xml:id="TMISB06-198"/>
                            
                            was accompanied by Miss Georgia Sharp.  Both ladies were in white, with white hats and parasols.</p>
                            <p>Two pretty pony carts came next, driven by Miss Eugenia Morand and Master Vernon Chase respectively.  The former looked a veritable fairy among the pink roses of her equipage, and receive much applause as she passed along.  The second cart was that of Miss Mary Mercer, and was tastefully decorated in red poppies and natural grasses.</p>
                            <p>Miss Nellie Bennett's turn-out, a high trap with canopy top, was the second vehicle in line decorated in royal purple, and excited much favorable comment.  Chrysanthemums were profusely employed, and varying shades of purple, violet and lavender were seen.  Miss Bennett was accompanied by Mrs. J. W. Woodward, the former being attired in white and the latter in violet.</p>
                            <p>Continuous signs of admiration marked the passage of Mrs. Robert Franklin Smith's cabriolet along the line of march.  The color scheme of pink and white was artistically carried out, the entire vehicle being upholstered in pink and solidly banked in La France roses, with garlands of smilax and roses and floating streamers of tarleton.  The bay horses were harnessed in pink satin ribbons and wide collars and gaily caparisoned in smilax and roses.  Mr. Smith drove, being all in white save for a pink tie; and Mrs. Smith, Mrs. John Barker and Mrs. Churchill Parker were gowned in white organdies over pink silk, huge bunches of roses, large picture hats and white chiffon parasols covered with <choice><sic>blessoms</sic><corr>blossoms</corr></choice>.  This equipage was quite generally picked as a winner by the spectators.</p>
                            
                            <p>Water lilies and asparagus formed the floral decorations of Miss Parrotte's handsome turn-out, which was a landau drawn by two fine black horses.  Miss Goodrich, Mrs. Eva Parrotte Sweeney and Mrs. J. P. Whitney rode with Miss Parrotte, and all were charmingly gowned in white, with parasols and picture hats to match.  Little Misses Joy Bailey and Ruth Slabaugh, dressed all in white, stood on the carriage steps.</p>
                            <p>Miss Louise Squires' pretty contribution to the harmonious <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> was an umbrella top, two wheeled cart, which had been transformed into a veritable bower of roses graduated in hue from pink to deep red.  Miss Edna Cowin accompanied Miss Squires, and the gowns were figured organdie, with ruffles of watermelon pink.  Mr. Fred Hamilton and Mr. Fred Nash acted as outriders.</p>
                            <p>Morning-glories of every shade adorned the trap driven by Mrs. A. J. Love, which was one of the most quietly effective vehicles shown.  With Mrs. Love were Mrs. Kate Dewey Squire, Mrs. Charles Offutt and Miss Georgia Lindsey, whose dainty summer toilets blended harmoniously with the picture.</p>
                            
                            <p>Another delicate and charming creation in white was Miss Andreesen's phaeton, which was drawn by white horses and the original shape and color of which was entirely concealed by an avalanche of white roses.  Miss Andreesen was accompanied by Miss Marion McDonald of St. Joseph, and their toilets were also in white throughout.</p>
                            <p>The colors of Ak-Sar-Ben were followed in the decoration of the carriage of Mrs. A. H. Noyes, the effect being produced by the use of poppies of red and yellow, in combination with green foliage, and of ribbons of appropriate hues.  Mrs. Noyes, Miss Elsie Noyes and Miss Vera Noyes occupied the vehicles, and their gowns were of white with red roses.</p>
                            <p>An especially gorgeous turn-out was that of Mrs. A. D. Brandeis, who had elaborated with flowers and gold effects upon a butterfly design of considerable scope.  No vehicle in the procession attracted more attention than this, which had many striking qualities all its own.  In the vehicle with Mr. and Mrs. Brandeis were Mrs. Julius Marcus of Chicago, Mrs. H. Friedman and Mrs. E. Fischel, all gowned becomingly, and on one of the lead horses rode little Miss Ruth Brandeis, as sweet as a fairy, in dress of white and gold.</p>
                            
                            <p>The handsome carriage driven by Miss Ura Kelly was exceedingly fortunate in its decorations, which were of chrysanthemums in three shades of pink, asparagus foliage and pink tarleton.  Miss Kelly was accompanied by Misses Grace and Marion Sanborn, of St. Paul.  The gowns were white, with white hats and parasols trimmed in pink chrysanthemums.</p>
                            <p>Pink roses and purple chrysanthemums were the decidedly effective decorations of the phaeton in which rode Mrs. M. C. Peters and Miss Peters.  The toilets of the ladies also assisted to carry out the color scheme, Mrs. Peters being gowned in heliotrope, and Miss Peters in white, with pink parasol and hat trimmed with pink.</p>
                            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Ford showed a very effective combination of black and yellow, the black being afforded by the polished surface of the vehicle, and yellow by roses and crossed ribbons.  In the carriage with Mr. and Mrs. Ford were Mrs. William Wyatt and Mrs. William Gyger of Philadelphia.  The gowns were all black, with yellow hats, and black parasols trimmed with yellow roses.</p>
                            
                            <p>A decided impression was created everywhere along the line by the appearance of Miss Dickinson's equipage, a trap, stunningly decorated in three shades of chrysanthemums, ranging from burnt orange to yellow.  The combination was exceedingly rich and artistic and was generally admired.  Miss Mount drove, and both ladies were dressed alike in white organdie, with large black hats.</p>
                            <p>A lively Shetland pony team, driven by Master Julius Maurer, drew a diminutive trap decorated in pink, white and yellow roses.  In the vehicle were also Misses Daisy and Anna and Masters Eddie and Rudolph Maurer.</p>
                            <p>One of the most elaborately and tastefully decorated vehicles in the parade was Mr. John L. Webster's drag, driven by a fine team of white horses.  The decorations were in three shades of chrysanthemums, the vehicle being outlined in smilax and the flowers laid so thickly as to give the impression of a solid mass of bloom.  White harness and high collars of flowers brought the horses into the charming picture.  Mr. Lewis B. Reed and Mr. Albert V. Foster, of Chicago, acted as outriders.  Mr. Empke, of Council Bluffs, drove, and in the drag were Miss Law, of Illinois, Miss Moore, of Council Bluffs, Miss Balcombe, Mrs. Webster and Miss Webster, all of whom were dressed in white, with white hats trimmed in chrysanthemums and white parasols.  This turn-out had many backers for a place among the prize winners.</p>
                            
                            <p>Miss Alice Parker's pretty equipage, decorated in an attractive lattice work of ox eye daisies over green, was one of the most novel and pleasing designs shown.  Miss Ethel Wilcox, Miss Cecil Parker and Miss Harriet Marsh accompanied Miss Parker, and all were gowned in white, with yellow hats.  The effect of this turn-out was pleasing in the extreme.</p>
                            <p>Mr. John N. Baldwin, of Council Bluffs, drove a T cart solidly decorated in three shades of red poppies.  The striking nature of the colors displayed in combining them, attracted much deserved attention to this display.  The occupants were Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin, Miss Genevieve Baldwin and Miss Ellnor Stewart.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. J. H. Evans' <choice><sic>hsndsome</sic><corr>handsome</corr></choice> victoria was shared by herself and Miss Amy Barker.  The Elks' colors were exemplified, the scheme of decorations having been specially designed by Mrs. Martin Meyer.  Heliotrope and white chrysanthemums were most profusely employed, the design being that known as "Van Dyck point."  The coachman wore a black satin livery with white top-boots, and the costumes of Mrs. Evans and Miss Amy Barker were of pure white.</p>
                            <p>Miss Anna Shiverick's carriage had been upholstered in a light shade of pink, on which a latticing of smilax, with borders of shaded pink chrysanthemums, produced a lovely effect.  With Miss Shiverick were Mrs. W. S. Poppleton and Miss Florence Morse.</p>
                            
                            <p>The fine turn out of Mrs. J. M. Metcalf presented the only decorative scheme of holly-hocks shown in the parade.  The possibilities of this flower, as applied to such ends, were shown to be great, the different shades of red and pink, and the green foliage contrasting against the black wood of the carriage, giving a most artistic effect.  Mrs. Metcalf was accompanied by Mrs. A. P. Metcalf, of Lincoln.</p>
                            <p>The carriage in which rode Miss Mae Hamilton and Miss Bessie Yates was beautifully decorated with chrysanthemums of royal purple and lavender.  They wore white, with hats and parasols trimmed in lavender.  Mr. Robert Patrick and Mr. William B. Cowin acted as outriders.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. G. W. Megeath's pony cart contained Mrs. Megeath, Miss Frances Tibbetts, and Miss Julia Coe, with Master Windsor Megeath, in a white livery, as footman.  Miss Leo Brown, also in white, accompanied the party on horseback.  The decorations were in white and pink roses, satin ribbons and smilax.</p>
                            <p>Lavender chrysanthemums had been lavishly and artistically employed in the adornment of Mrs. C. J. Barber's phaeton, which followed next in line, and which found much favor in the eyes of the spectators.  White satin <choice><sic>ribbens</sic><corr>ribbons</corr></choice>, woven among the flowers, heightened and emphasized a delightful effect.  Miss Mabel Barber was with Mrs. Barber.</p>
                            <p>Another pleasing effect in white concluded the parade.  Mr. Jack Cudahy's trap, decorated solidly in white bride roses and white tarleton, was occupied by Miss Curtis and Miss Doane, who were both attired in all white.  The white horses had white harness and were hung with garlands of white roses.</p>
                            
                            <p>The judges' award bestowed prizes upon the equipages of Mrs. J. H. Evans, Mrs. Howard Baldrige and Mr. John N. Baldwin, in the order named, representations of all of which may be seen on our first page this week.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mr. Phinney and the members of his band each wore holly-hocks and their leaves, made and presented to them by Mrs. Metcalf, who was appointed to request them to lead the parade.</p>
                            
                            <p>in conclusion, it should be said that the flower parade&#8212;the first ever given in the middle west&#8212;was an unqualified success in every way.  The fortunate consummation of so pretty a plan reflects the utmost credit upon all concerned: upon Mrs. Travis, who organized and superintended the whole; upon Mrs. Orr and her committee of ladies, whose shoulders bore the weight of arranging the details; and upon each and all of the participants in the parade itself, none of whom could have been spared from a picture of rare and varied beauty, the like of which has never been seen in Omaha.</p>

                            <p>An exhibit novel to Omaha is the Infant Incubator, located at the north end of the east Midway at the exposition, which was opened Thursday afternoon with a private view to the press.  Living infants were on hand, to show the value of this process for the rearing of prematurely and weakly born babies, and great was the curiosity it excited.</p>
                            
                            <p>M. de Valcourt-Vermont, who is perhaps better known in the west as Count St. Germaine, left Thursday evening for Chicago, having been appointed French secretary to Mr. Ferd. Peck, the commissioner general to the Paris exposition.  The Count de Vermont will continue his concession at the Trans-Mississippi exposition, the palmistry booth, which will be managed for him by his business partner.  He was accompanied to Chicago by his wife, a charming woman, and they will shortly go to Paris, where he is to arrange preliminaries, making a six weeks' stay.  Count de Vermont belongs to one of the oldest families of Paris and has always been engaged in literary work, being manager for the Chicago house of Laird &amp; Lee at the time he came to Omaha.  He is the author of a large two volume work on palmistry, and editor of the magazine of that name, and also published some years ago America Heraldica, a work on the heraldry of American families that came here prior to the revolution.</p>
                            
                            <p>The beautiful residence of Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Cudahy on Farnam street hill is rapidly progressing.  J. A. Fuller &amp; Co. are now putting in the plate glass windows.  The glass was made to order, ground to uniform thickness, very highly polished, and will help to make this one of the most beautiful residences in the west.  The decorators are here and will begin work as soon as the glass is set.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mr. John S. Knox has received the pleasant news that his brother, Capt. Thomas T. Knox, who was wounded in one of the first battles of the Cuban war, is now out of danger.  His recovery is due no doubt, in large part to his own indomitable courage.  When he was hit by a Spanish bullet he made his way to the nearest surgeon and asked to have his wound bound up.  "Why, man," said the surgeon, "there is nothing to be done for you.  You cannot live three hours!"  Captain Knox said he guessed he'd try it, and again insisted on surgical aid.  "Well, if you haven't any messages to send home I'll do this for you," said the surgeon, "I can't disregard the last request of a dying man."  So he fixed the captain up and laid him on a bed of sand beside a creek to die.  The captain was bound he wouldn't die and begged to be taken down to the sea shore and put on board the Olivette, but could find no bearers.  After lying in the sand some hours, left to his own reflections, which were anything but cheerful, he hailed some passing soldiers, who proved to be men of his own command.  They fixed up a litter and bore him to the hospital ship, where he was carefully nursed.  Captain Knox is now on duty again, with a new title, Inspector General, with the rank of major.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mrs. Squires carriage, which suffered an accident that rendered it <hi rend="italic">hors du combat</hi> in the flower parade her horses breaking the pole, was number thirteen in the line.  This makes all who tremble at the mention of that unhappy number tremble once again.  The crowd scattered when the horses began to rear and plunge, and it was vastly amusing to see the husbands thereupon scold their wives for their temerity as husbands have a habit of doing when danger is more apparent than real.</p>
                            
                            <p>Mr. Benyaker, of the Street of All Nations, has a fine collection of swords, daggers and pistols gathered in various parts of the holy land and Turkey.</p>
                            
                            <p>The managing editor that has been at his wits end to find room for war news and get scare heads startling enough for the service, will soon, if indications are clear, have an equally embarrassing time to find any news at all for his columns sensational enough to engage the attention of the public.</p>
                            <p>"Great battle, many lives lost!" has given place with the shrill-lunged newsboys to the old commonplace stand-by of their profession, "Bloody murder!"</p>
                            
                            <p>The successful issue of the negotiations for peace between America and Spain is welcomed by no community more than this.  The finish of the war and its disturbing elements means a great deal, not only for an increased attendance at and interest in our exposition, but the immediate forwarding of all business interests centered here.  Grain is already beginning to move, our jobbing houses are full of order and the outlook for the fall is very bright.</p>
                            
                            <p>The lord mayor of London is coming to study American cities.  By all means sweep the streets and ask him to stop off an hour in Omaha.  They can probably be kept clean for that length of time.</p>
                            
                            <p>The drill of the life saving service that takes place on the lagoon every day except Sunday at four o'clock is a sight which few in this part of the world are accustomed to and draws immense crowds.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH MISSOURI?</hi></head>
                            <p>It seems incomprehensible why the state of Missouri is not more in evidence at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Missouri excels not only in population, but in its vast and varied natural and industrial resources, every other state west of the Mississippi.  The empire state of the transmississippi region could fill every foot of space of the Mines building with the products of its iron, zinc, lead and coal mines.  Its building stone from granite to limestone is in itself a source of wealth greater than the argentiferous deposits of Colorado or the fabled gold fields of the Klondike.  Missouri could, if so disposed, have made the most magnificent showing in the agricultural building, and yet it is distanced by Oklahoma and Kansas in the variety and quality of its products of the soil.  For the first three months after the exposition opened the space allotted to Missouri in the Agricultural building consisted of a pyramid of flour sacks and a reception room for stray Missourians.  This meager exhibit was finally reinforced by a collection of cereals, but it is far from creditable.</p>
                            <p>What is the matter with Missouri is the question heard on all sides in the exposition grounds, and it seems strange that the Missouri commission, which is more numerous than the commissions of any seven states represented in the exposition, has not yet realized the discredit which will attach to its failure to have the resources of their great state properly advertised.  While nearly a million and a half of people have passed through the gates it is not too late yet for Missouri to make a decent showing in the exposition, which in the next six weeks will be visited by from one to two millions of people.</p>
                            <p>Another very singular thing about Missouri is the inexplicable indifference shown by the metropolis of that state in failing to avail itself of the opportunities afforded by the exposition to cultivate and extend its trade relations.  While the merchants and manufacturers of St. Louis are planning an invasion into Porto Rico Chicago is organizing business men's excursions to Omaha and the heart of the corn belt, which consumes and buys more factory products and merchandise in one month than the poverty-stricken, lazy, shiftless people of Porto Rico and Cuba consume and purchase in a year.  Not only have the mercantile classes of Chicago caught on to the fact that the Transmississippi Exposition affords an unrivaled opportunity for expanding their commerce, but the social and political clubs, such as the Union league, Athletic, Marquette and Iroquois, are all organizing palace car excursions for Chicago day.  And yet St. Louis is eighty miles nearer Omaha than Chicago by the shortest route and twenty miles by the shortest route.</p>
                            <p>Again, what is the matter with Missouri and what's the matter with St. Louis, which has every incentive for cultivating closer trade relations with Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and the Pacific coast states, whose products are creditably represented at this exposition, acknowledged by all to be second only in magnitude and magnificence to the World's Columbian fair.</p>
                        </div2>
                        <div2 type="article">
                            <p>There is yet in store for Omaha an event the like of which the city never has enjoyed, nor perhaps never can enjoy.  The peace jubilee will mark the culminating point of success in the history of the Transmississippi Exposition.  The city proper must rise to the occasion.</p>

                            <p>The United States senators and congressmen who were scheduled to assist in the celebration of Government day at the exposition are apparently busily employed at home, for none of them outside of the Nebraska members appeared.  Consequently the exercises of the day possessed merely a local significance, the congressional party being limited to the two Nebraska senators and Congressman Mercer, who were accompanied by Rev. W. H. Milburn, the blind chaplain of the senate, C. H. Birtle, superintendent of public documents, and E. C. Snyder, private secretary to Senator Thurston.</p>
                            <p>But the presence of a few senators more or less seemed to have no influence on the people who wanted to see the exposition and the crowd at least fulfilled all expectations.  Only a small proportion of the visitors attended the exercises, but they poured through the buildings and over the grounds by thousands.  Even a very limited minority was sufficient to furnish a very complimentary audience to speakers of the day, and when the official party arrived at the Auditorium at 11 o'clock they found the lower part of the house well occupied.</p>
                            <p>The exercises were preceded by a short concert by the Omaha Concert band, and as the speeches were commendably brief, the crowd was retained until the close.  The guests of the day were given a flattering reception, which seemed particularly directed to Dr. Milburn, who was conducted to the stage by his daughter and General Manager Clarkson.  President Wattles briefly announced the nature of the celebration and introduced Senator Thurston as chairman.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston was given a very complimentary reception, after which he introduced Dr. Milburn, who offered an earnest invocation.  In this he rendered thanks for the victories that had attended the American arms and for the magnificent triumph of man's labor which is represented by this exposition.  He thanked God that the close of the century is glorified by such a spectacle and prayed that it might tend to develop the sentiment of brotherhood throughout the land.</p>

                            <head type="sub">How Congress Helped.</head>
                            <p>In welcoming the congressional visitors President Wattles referred particularly to the assistance that had been rendered by the general government in building the exposition.  At that time the panic of 1893 had been followed by the drouth of 1894 and 1895, and the conditions were in every way discouraging.  The assistance of the government was essential to make the enterprise a success.  The congressional representatives had saved the exposition by their effective work and to them is due no small part of the credit for the magnificent result obtained.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles also emphasized the value of the exhibits in the Government building, which had been of the greatest interest to thousands of visitors who would otherwise have never enjoyed an opportunity to see how the work of the various departments of the government was carried on.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston expressed the sentiment of the committee and said that its members were amazed at the wonderful spectacle that has been presented to the people at this exposition.  The United States government had recognized but few expositions by the appropriation of money and the installation of an exhibit.  It was with extreme hesitation as to the result that the task of securing the government recognition had been undertaken.  The speaker paid a high compliment to Senator Allen and Congressman Mercer, whom, he said, had been more than anyone else responsible for the success that had been achieved.  In making the appropriation the government had recognized the resources and the future of the mighty empire of the west, and here it had made the best exhibit that it had ever made at any exposition.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston emphasized the service that had been done by the government in bringing together the Indian encampment.  This, he said, is a spectacle that the world never saw before, and is not likely to see again.  He expressed his gratification that the exposition is a financial success and predicted that the closing weeks would bring a still greater measure of prosperity.  It was not to be expected that while the soul of the nation was bound up in the war the people could give the exposition the attention it deserves.  But now the clouds of war have passed away and the sun of prosperity shines in a sky resplendent with the stars of the union.  This is a glorious year.  In 114 days two great navies have been destroyed by American men-of-war and a great army of 250,000 men has been routed by 23,000 American soldiers.</p>

                            <p>Senator Allen was introduced and suggested that all the credit for this enterprise did not belong to Captain Mercer and himself.  Every Nebraskan who had come to Washington had assisted to bring about the result.  Then the achievement of the management was wonderful.  It had been expected that this exposition would be like that of Atlanta, but it had gone further, and become the admiration of the world.  Every citizen of the commonwealth is proud of it and it is a picture that every Nebraskan will carry in his heart for all time.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen was followed by Congressman Mercer, who was greeted with generous enthusiasm.  He made a happy allusion to the harmony between the beautifully undulating prairies of Nebraska and the magnificent panorama of the exposition, one the handiwork of God, and the other the best production of man.  He refuted the suggestion that this country is having too many expositions, and contended that they are the most effective educators of the people.  This exposition is not to be seen in a hurry.  People who take their time and investigate the exhibits fully will find hundreds of things that they had never thought of and that they would miss altogether if they tried to see the whole show at once.</p>
                            <p>The speaker referred briefly to some of the most valuable features of the exposition and declared that many of them are worth coming from Europe to see.  This is especially true of the Indian encampment, which is the history of a race that will soon be extinct.  In conclusion he eulogized the wonderful progress that Nebraska has made in the last fifty years and declared that in a few more years it will not only be the greatest corn producing state in the union, but its metropolis will be the biggest packing center in the world.</p>
                            <p>The concluding address by Dr. Milburn was heard with more than ordinary interest.  He was introduced by Senator Thurston as a man who had been denied the sunlight, but whose soul is illuminated by the knowledge of God.  Dr. Milburn referred to the time when the bill that provided for the organization of Nebraska as a territory was before congress and said that he was then frequently asked what this Nebraska was.  Since then the state has been pretty vigorously demonstrating itself and the whole world is familiar with its achievements.  What marvels had been wrought and are still working out by the men and women of our race and of other stocks that have been incorporated into our own.  Here is a spectacle that kindles genius, awakens the memory, inspires the imagination and gives man a vantage ground to survey what has been done, what is still doing and what is yet to do.  It is denied to me to look on its beauties, but I sympathize in your triumph.  Its beauty cannot come to me through the eye, but it comes through the ear and I too draw an inspiration from its beauty.  Dr. Milburn closed with an eloquent benediction and after another selection by the band the visitors adjourned to the cafe where lunch was served.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exposition Attendance <choice><sic>Graws</sic><corr>Grows</corr></choice> Steadily as the Days Run Swiftly By.</head>
                            <p>Monday brought the usual influx of new visitors to succeed those who have gone away full of admiration for the great show.  The fresh arrivals were fully as numerous as usual in spite of the fact that a large number of people are waiting for Iowa day and Modern Woodmen's day, and this is taken as a very reliable indication that the expectations of an unprecedented attendance during the week are likely to be realized.  In view of the exceptional events that are scheduled for the middle of the week and which will draw very largely from the territory immediately surrounding Omaha a slight stagnancy was probable at the beginning, but this did not occur.  Another very encouraging fact is that a largely increased proportion of yesterday's arrivals was from comparatively distant points, and most of these will spend the entire week in the city.  Today and tomorrow the tide from Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska will set in with full force and there is every assurance that the next few days will see the biggest crowds that have yet appeared.</p>
                            <p>The Bee excursion has caught popular fancy and Nebraskans the state over are making preparations to take advantage of opportunities offered by the project to visit the exposition during the present week.  This will be another potent factor in bringing the attendance up to top-notch figures.  Crowds from every city of the state are coming, people who, had it not been for The Bee's enterprise, would have remained at home through considerations of time and expenses and people who planned to come and enrolled themselves as Bee excursionists to augment their supply of spending money.</p>
                            <p>By special arrangements with the B. &amp; M. railroad The Bee is enabled to offer to subscribers, old and new, unsurpassed opportunities and privileges to visit the exposition at a minimum expense.  Extremely low railroad rates, large discounts at hotels and free admission to ten of the best attractions on the Midway are the privileges extended to those joining the excursion.  For five days, beginning September 21, the excursion will last and that the attendance will be increased many-fold as a result is already assured.  The rates from the various towns, including all expenses, are given in another column.</p>
                            <p>As far as the original debt of the exposition is concerned the enterprise is now fairly out of debt.  Of the amount that was outstanding September 1 only about $27,000 remains, and the operating expenses up to last night will not exceed $38,000.  This indicates a total indebtedness of $65,000 in round numbers and the exposition has almost exactly this amount to its credit in the bank.  But the large expenditure which has been authorized on account of the stock show now stands as indebtedness and until this is out of the way the management will not consider itself entirely free from obligations.  The exposition has put up premiums aggregating $35,000 for the stock show and the preparations of the grounds and the construction of the buildings will add nearly $30,000 to this amount.  While these amounts are charged as indebtedness on the books they represent expenditures on account of benefits that are yet to accrue and as far as the original expenditure is concerned the exposition does not owe a dollar beyond what it has the money in the bank to pay.</p>
                            <p>Wyoming day was another of those euphonious terms that fill space in a program without materially inflating the gate receipts.  Inasmuch as the state has been decidedly backward in its support of the exposition Governor Richards decided that it was not worth while to celebrate the occasion, and there was nothing to distinguish it but the informal attendance of a few Wyoming people.</p>

                            <p>A party of 143 delegates to a convention of colored Baptists at Kansas City came up yesterday to visit the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A party of nurses from the Clarkson Memorial hospital came out yesterday to see the sham battle and were escorted through the Indian encampment by General Manager Clarkson.</p>
                            <p>W. B. Kniskern, general passenger agent of the Northwestern railroad, will arrive in Omaha today with Secretary A. J. Clarke and Mr. Eicker of the Union League club of Chicago.  The trip is for the purpose of arranging for the entertainment of the club when it comes to help boom Chicago day.</p>
                            <p>A telegram received from Dr. George L. Miller states that he is in Utica, N. Y., waiting for J. Sterling Morton to join him in a trip into the Adirondacks after ex-President Harrison.  Mr. Harrison is domiciled only a short distance from Utica and President Wattles expects to hear in a day or two that he had promised to add his presence to the personal attractions of Jubilee week.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Foster of the Buildings and Grounds department is rushing the work on the stock barns south of the Indian encampment and these will be completed by the end of the week.  There are three tiers of buildings, each 100 feet long, which extend from the fence back of the Dairy building to Twenty-fourth street.  There are nearly fifty separate buildings and they form a miniature city in rough lumber.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Kelly of the Music department is making a hit with his daily organ recitals in the Auditorium.  The audiences run well toward 1,000 people every afternoon and the program are received with very liberal approval.  Yesterday a transcription of the "Bridal Music" from Lohengrin and a meditation in E flat by Flagler were among the number which elicited the most enthusiastic approval.  Mr. Kelly also played a boat song of his own composition, which was a very musicianly conception.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Today is Iowa day at the exposition, and in order to crowd as much entertainment and enjoyment into the allotted time as possible, the festivities incident to the occasion were commenced last night, and will be continued during today, with brief intermissions, until the appearance of the sun over the Iowa bluffs announces the approach of another day.</p>
                            <p>The occasion was inaugurated by a banquet at the Omaha club last night, the Iowa exposition commission being the host of the occasion and the honored guests being Senators Allen and Thurston and Representatives Mercer of Nebraska, the venerable ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, President Wattles of the exposition, Major C. E. Hambleton, secretary of the Illinois commission; Managers Lindsey, Rosewater, Kirkendall, Bruce and Babcock, Adjutant General P. H. Barry of Nebraska, Adjutant General Byers of Iowa, Colonel McHenry and Colonel Wyman of Governor Shaw's staff, Secretary Wakefield, C. S. Montgomery and R. W. Richardson of the exposition, Mayor Jennings of Council Bluffs and several of the citizens of that municipality.</p>
                            <p>The banquet was held in the large hall at the club, the tables forming three sides of a hollow square.  Meteor roses and delicate, lacelike ferns formed the decorations, the deep, rich red and delicate green forming a beautiful contrast on the snowy background of the linen.  The menu was of that delicious and epicurean variety which is characteristic of the club, and the service was faultless.</p>

                            <p>Ex-Governor S. B. Rickard, chairman of the executive committee of the Iowa commission, acted as the toastmaster of the evening, President Mallory being detained in Texas by private business.  The speaking was interspersed with entertaining selections by the Dudley Buck quartet of Council Bluffs, composed of I. M. Treynor, W. S. Rigdon, J. H. Simms and W. L. Thickstun.</p>
                            <p>When the cigars were lighted the toastmaster said the banquet was held in honor of the president and other officers of the exposition, and he introduced Senator Allen as a former Iowan, who had been loaned to Nebraska, and who had been largely instrumental in making the exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen reviewed the events surrounding the inception and organization of the exposition and the struggle for recognition at the hands of congress, and spoke in the strongest terms of the great importance of the exposition to the west, declaring that it would result in bringing together all sections of the country and binding the friendships thus formed.  He said the people of Nebraska know no party lines where the common interests of all are concerned, but work together for the common good and he pledged the business men of Omaha the good will of the people of the state so long as the latter are shown the generous treatment that has been accorded them in the past.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles followed Senator Allen and spoke briefly of the history of the organization and carrying out of the exposition, dwelling upon the substantial support which had been rendered by the people of Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THURSTON'S ELOQUENCE.</head>
                            <p>Senator Thurston was asked to respond to the sentiment "To Our Nation."  He spoke briefly but eloquently, referring in well-rounded periods to the progress of the American flag over the seas and concluding in a brilliant peroration.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Saunders spoke in an interesting strain of the early days he spent in Iowa, when the country now forming that prosperous state was a portion of Michigan, relating a number of most interesting reminiscences.</p>
                            <p>Judge Deemer of the Iowa supreme court spoke briefly on "The Judiciary," and was followed by S. C. MacFarland, editor of the Times-Republican of Marshalltown and ex-speaker of the house of representatives of the Iowa legislature.  He spoke of the part taken by the press of Iowa in aiding in the movement to have Iowa represented at the exposition, and declared that if the press had not taken hold of the matter there would have been no occasion for a banquet such as was then in progress.  He also talked of the progress which has been made in Iowa in the matter of newspapers in the last forty years.</p>
                            <p>Lafe Young, editor of the Des Moines Capital, bearing upon his clothes the dust of travel from the fever-laden district of Santiago de Cuba, was a late arrival on the scene and was at once called on to tell about his experiences with the Fifth army corps, under Shafter.  Mr. Young's talk was a mixture of the grave and gay; an eloquent description of the stirring scene in which he had so recently taken part and a humorous narrative of some of the brighter incidents of the campaign in southern climes.  He paid a high tribute to the enduring heroism of the regular soldiers and to General Shafter, but he declared that if Shafter and all of the other general officers had been at the bottom of the sea the battles would have been won, just the same, so great was the determination of the troops to put into practice the art which they had been studying for the last thirty years.</p>
                            <p>Representative Mercer was the last speaker, being called on to toast "The Ladies," which duty was performed with gallant language.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Next to the United States senators, the Indians as nature made 'em attracted more attention than anyone else yesterday at the exposition, and it is said that more senators went to see the Indians than did Indians to see the senators.  Anyhow, the sham battle at 5 p. m. was witnessed by a distinguished delegation of government officials, including Indian Commissioner Jones, and it was the best worked out of any of the three sham battles, with more tactics, finer clothing and style in the preliminary parade, and no accidents.  Both together brought out 18,674 people, a total to date of 1,438,357.</p>
                            <p>The squaws, with babies fastened to their backs, and the walking size by the hand, advanced by tribes on foot, and after introduction by a flank movement, marched directly in front of all of the 10,000 spectators.  The warriors, elegantly dressed and mounted, followed by tribes, galloping up, each chief following alone a moment later and joining his braves.  At last the Apaches briskly rode up, their bodies bending low over their ponies.  Old Geronimo dashed out a moment later, the friskiest brave of them all, took his place in front of the line, bowed to the grand stand and led his band away.  He was a field spectator of the battle.</p>
                            <p>Then squaws and warriors approached in a mass, a big salute was fired and all retired, the 200 Sioux, Kiowas, Witchitas, Cheyennes and Comanches to the east under Goes-to-War, and all the other allied tribes to the west under Big Brave, chief of the Blackfeet.  They were the Poncas, Blackfeet, Flatheads, Lonkewas, Omahas, Winnebagoes, Apaches, Arapahoes, Sacs and Foxes.  Big Brave's army had a stray Sioux, whom they proceeded to roast over a slow fire placed around his feet, while a delegation beat the tom-tom, and the allied tribes danced about in a circle to add torture to his sufferings.  Sioux scouts heard the noise, located the center of commotion, drew out a pair of Big Brave's scouts, when they ambuscaded, killed and scalped, and precipitated the battle.</p>
                            <p>Goes-to-War rushed his forces into the field so quickly that Big Brave and his army fled in confusion, leaving their prisoner, not yet in the sizzling stage, to be rescued by his friends.  In the mix-up a Blackfoot was captured, the old fire was quickly stirred up and Mr. Blackfoot found himself right in the middle of it.</p>
                            <p>Big Brave rallied his scattered forces, made them a thrilling speech and charged the Sioux, who had become partially demoralized by victory.  Right there occurred the prettiest work of the day.  Daring rushes were made by individuals, but the forces were kept well together till at last the Sioux and their friends had too much and began a well-ordered retreat when the bugle sounded recall, the dead came to life, and the mimic battle had passed into history.</p>
                            <p>At night an interesting war dance was given, but the big crowd of the day melted away and but few <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>For today, after the elaborate Iowa day exercises of the afternoon are disposed of, the Indians will hold attention during the late afternoon and evening, giving way to a big fireworks display, with special Iowa pyrotechnics, at 9 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>At 4 p. m. will occur the Wichita horn dance by the Wichita Indians brought to the exposition a week ago by Prof. James Mooney of the American bureau of ethnology.  This will be the first time the horn dance has ever been given in public, and like most dances, has religious meaning.  It was originally a ceremonial prayer for an increase of the buffalo, but after the palefaces had driven this animal from the plains the prayers are given with manifold fervor for the return of the buffalo and the old Indian life.</p>
                            <p>The women participate, the warriors being stripped, painted and mounted on their best ponies.  It is a picturesque feature when the Wichitas invoke the sun, with uplifted hands by the mounted warriors.</p>
                            <p>The Wichitas are a corn-growing tribe, living formerly in the Wichita mountains, thus deriving their name.  They live in peculiarly built grass houses, one of which was purchased by Prof. Mooney, and is now being set up on the grounds.  Their chief, Towaconi Jim, who accompanies the party, has seen long service as a government scout, and is an eloquent speaker in both languages.</p>

                            <p>In the evening the Arapahoes, assisted by several friendly tribes, will give their peculiar and picturesque bow dance in full costume.  This is a spectacular performance, consisting of alternate advances and retreats by warriors armed with the old-time bow and arrow.  Many complicated movements occur.  The Sioux have asked permission to "buy" the dance, and by presents of ponies are privileged to participate.  The warriors are being equipped with lances and shields, and the grand review will contain 150 lances and half as many shields in heraldic designs.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday was Government day at the exposition&#8212;the day set apart for the visit of the representatives of the national legislature to the great enterprise which has been fostered by the general government by substantial appropriations for federal participation in the exposition of the resources of the great west.  It was anticipated that the day would be big with events and that at least a dozen men of national reputation would be in attendance as the representatives of the government.  Every assurance had been given that these men would be here, but these expectations were not realized.  Not a senator or representative from outside of Nebraska appeared to participate in the ceremonies which had been arranged for the occasion and upon the Nebraska representatives alone devolved the task of upholding the dignity of the national government.</p>
                            <p>Senator Harris telegraphed to Senator Thurston that the critical condition of a son who is ill with typhoid would detain him at home; Senator Vest is seriously ill at his home; Senator Pettigrew telegraphed that poor health would prevent him from coming; Senator Warren was here Monday with the delegation from Wyoming, but started east Monday night.  The other members of the committee sent telegrams of regret, and the result was that the Nebraska senators were the only members of the committee who were on hand when the guests of the occasion assembled at the Millard hotel this morning.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the senatorial committee, it had been expected that five members of the lower house, Representatives Cousins of Iowa, Foss and Mann of Illinois, Sherman of New York and William H. Green and David H. Mercer of Nebraska, would be on hand to represent the co-ordinate branch of the national legislature.  Of these Mr. Mercer was the only one to appear.</p>
                            <p>Representative Cousins telegraphed that he would reach Omaha on Wednesday morning ,and Mr. Foss sent a message that he expects to be in Omaha later in October.</p>
                            <p>Rev. W. H. Milburn of Washington, D. C., the blind chaplain of the senate, Colonel E. C. Snyder, secretary to Senator Thurston, and Charles Pirtle, a clerk in the document room in Washington, were of the party.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles, General Manager Clarkson and Press Commissioner Richardson were at the hotel to receive the guests.  Carriages were taken at 10:30 <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">RECEPTION AT AUDITORIUM.</head>
                            <p>A fair-sized audience had assembled in the Auditorium to hear the forenoon concert of the Omaha Concert band and this audience became larger as the senatorial party entered the building, as the blind chaplain of the United States senate, Rev. W. H. Milburn, came in led by Miss Sisson and General Manager Clarkson, followed by Senators Allen and Thurston, Congressman Mercer and President Wattles, Private secretary Snyder and Superintendent of Documents Pirtle, it was received with cordial applause.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles presented Senator Thurston, chairman of the senatorial committee, as president of the occasion.  Senator Thurston, without any preliminaries, introduced Chaplain Milburn, who offered prayer.  The invocation was followed with an address by President Wattles.</p>
                            <p>His address was short.  It described how vital and indeed indispensable to the success of the exposition was the assistance of the government in the appropriation for its participation.  For this assistance and participation he took occasion to thank congress on behalf of the exposition through the committee present.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston declared that it was the unwritten law of the United States senate that the presiding officer should make no speech.  He would, he said, violate the law by making remarks for but a few minutes.  He said that the committee was not only satisfied with the spectacle presented on the grounds, but was amazed at the magnificence of the exposition.  The United States had appropriated but for four expositions, the present, of course, being the latest.  It was almost impossible to believe that congress would appropriate for an exposition so soon after Nashville; and it was with hesitation that the Nebraska delegation sought one.  To two men was due the credit of securing the appropriation.  They were Senator Allen and Congressman Mercer.  In the senate the condition was peculiar because no party had a majority there, and it was necessary to get the support of all parties.  This Senator Allen did admirably, for there was not a dissentient note.  This at once lifted the exposition project high above the plane of party or of sectionalism.  It was a grand recognition by the senate of the great empire of the west and of the fact that in the west lay the great possibilities.</p>

                            <p>Never, said Senator Thurston, had the government ever made so excellent an exhibit as on these grounds.  And the senator referred to the Indian congress, for which an additional appropriation was made, as a spectacle that had never been before seen on the globe and might never be again.</p>
                            <p>The committee was pleased with all.  It was pleased that so great an exposition had been made with such a good financial record.  It was pleased that its own doubts regarding the exposition had been resolved.  All the more gratifying was the success in view of the distraction of the war.  What a year for humanity!  What a year for the relief of oppressed peoples!  What a year for the flag which, before being the ensign of a free people, is now the banner symbolizing man's humanity to man.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SENATOR ALLEN.</head>
                            <p>Senator Thurston was followed by Senator Allen, who declared that all of the credit of the enterprise was not due to Congressman Mercer and himself.  There was a time when the exposition's fate hung trembling in the balance, and at that time every Nebraskan in Washington did his best to promote the appropriation.  That saved the exposition.</p>
                            <p>He was proud of the result.  He had expected something like the Atlantic or the Nashville show, excellent in themselves but limited, but here was something that challenged the admiration of the world.  The Nebraskans at Washington were determined that the state and the west should not be forgotten and the world was now here to see what they were.</p>

                            <p>Congressman Mercer made the next address.  He also had a word about the question as to who credit was due for the exposition, unterrified by discouragements and adverse circumstances.  An exposition, he declared, was a good thing.  Expositions were educators.  This one was easily second to the World's fair.  Mr. Mercer lavished special praise on the government exhibit and building, both better than every before.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer mentioned many of the prominent features of the exposition, and expressed pleasure that so many were coming to see it.</p>

                            <p>Chaplain Milburn, introduced in a few words of much compliment by Senator Thurston, made the concluding address.  The chaplain said he happened to be a chaplain in congress when the Kansas and Nebraska bill<unclear reason="torn"/> and <unclear reason="torn"/> go about the <unclear reason="torn"/>  If those people could be here now, the chaplain said, they would have their question answered better than anyone would have known how to answer it then.

                            <p>Chaplain Milburn made reference to the purchase of Louisiana and the Lewis and Clarke expedition and to the development of the west following.  A long span from 1854 to the present time, but what marvels have been wrought and what a lesson to the world has been taught.  A country settled, developed and civilized, the home of culture and Christianity!  The exposition was a sermon on the text of the nineteenth century.  Though he himself was denied the enjoyment of the spectacle through the eye, he yet entered into the triumph by what others said, and he could see a greater triumph in the remaining days of the exposition.  His conclusion was a benediction on the management, the western people the soldiers and sailors and on all the people of the United States.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of the exercises the distinguished guests were tendered a luncheon by the exposition managers.</p>

                            gates they filled up the big enclosure at a rate that promises to almost equal the tremendous congregation of the Fourth of July.  With the inspiration of a beautiful autumn day the Iowa day celebration eclipsed the most extravagant expectations of its promoters.  The railroads were simply unable to haul the people who wanted to come to Omaha this morning and every train that pulled across the bridge was loaded to the doors.  The crush was almost as great on the street car lines.  Early this morning the street railway company turned out every piece of rolling stock in its barns.  The loop service on the Twenty-fourth street and Sherman avenue lines was multiplied until the trains were frequently running less than 200 feet apart and even at that every car carried all the people that could hang on the footboards.  All three of the lines leading to the grounds were run to their full capacity and the rush continued well into the afternoon.</p>
                            <p>At the grounds the crowd was in evidence from the minute the gates were opened.  Several hundred people were waiting at the main entrances when the gatemen unlocked their turnstiles and from then until late in the afternoon the stiles scarcely ceased turning.  There was a continual crush in front of the ticket windows, but the crowd was admirably handled and no one experienced any avoidable delay.  Before 9 o'clock the rush was on in full force and for four hours there was no let up.  Even the Sherman avenue gate south of the Horticultural building was literally besieged by visitors who headed for the Iowa building before beginning their inspection of the grounds.  The state building was flooded with Hawkeyes all day and after 8 o'clock it was almost impossible to move through the apartments.  The Iowa commissioners were overwhelmed, but jubilant, and they congratulated each other on the prospect that the attendance record might be broken.  At noon there were very nearly as many people on the grounds as there were at the same hour July 4, when there was a big celebration to draw the bulk of the crowd out in the forenoon.  Today the celebration occurs in the afternoon and it was expected that the late arrivals would be comparatively more numerous.</p>

                            <p>The exercises of the day will be held at the Auditorium at 2:30 o'clock instead of in the forenoon as is customary on similar occasions.  The change is made on account of the parade, in which a large proportion of the Iowa visitors will participate.  The Auditorium program includes a number of very attractive musical numbers, which will furnish enjoyable interludes in the speechmaking.  After an organ voluntary Vice President Allan Dawson of the Iowa commission will deliver the introductory address and this will be followed by a selection by the Ladies' band of Eldora.  Miss Lucile Franchere will play a violin solo preceding the address of Governor Shaw.  President Wattles will respond to the governor as the representative of the exposition management and Hon. Robert G. Cousins will deliver the oration of the day.  There will also be vocal solos by Nellie Mae Brewster and Mary Teresa Louthan and a concluding quickstep by the Iowa Agricultural College Cadet band.  The exercises will be followed by a dress parade on the Plaza by the cadet battalion of the agricultural college and a reception at the Iowa state building.  There will be fireworks in the evening, and new and unique dances at the Indian encampment.</p>

                            <p>The parade was headed by the Ames Agricultural college band, followed by the First and Second battalions of college cadets.  Governor Shaw and his staff and Adjutant General Byers and staff mounted were preceded by the Logan band.  Following the citizens of Council Bluffs in carriages came prominent citizens from all over the state.  There were twenty carriages in all.  In the first rode President Wattles of the exposition, Hon. R. G. Cousins, the orator of the day; General Barry, and C. G. McCarthy, Iowa state auditor.  Among other prominent Iowans in carriages were the following:  Judge and Mrs. Deemer of Red Oak, V. P. Dawson, Hon. Lafe Young, S. C. McFarland, John H. Wallbank, Judge Robinson, J. E. E. Markley, R. S. Bandy, A. B. Cummings, J. Y. Stone, F. N. Chase, G. M. Parker, Hon. L. M. Jaeger, J. E. Rowen, Thomas Arthur, George McCoid, Owen Lovejoy, Robert Moore and A. D. Huston.</p>
                            <p>The parade passed through the principal streets and entered the exposition grounds at 2:30, where General Clarkson took the delegation in charge.</p>

                            <p>The exercises at the Auditorium commenced almost promptly at the time set, and the first address was by Allan Dawson, editor of the Des Moines Leader, and vice president of the Iowa Exposition commission.  The Ladies' band of Eldora played a selection, and Miss Lucile Franchere rendered a violin solo, after which Governor Shaw made an address on the part of his state.  He said:</p>
                            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens and Friends of Iowa: "Not so many generations ago, in the place where you now sit, encircled by all that exalts and embellishes civilized life, the rank thistle nodded in the breeze, and the wild fox dug his hole unscared."  So said Charles Sprague, three-quarters of a century ago, and the utterance is as true when applied to the land of the Omahas as to the land of the Wampanongs.</p>
                            <p>We meet this day as citizens of Iowa, on the soil of a sister state, for no idle purpose.  The people of Iowa are not idlers, but the day will have been lost to us and to our children unless what is here said, and done, and witnessed, and enjoyed shall bring greater thoughtfulness and increased earnestness.  The half century and two years since the admission of Iowa added the twenty-ninth star to the flag which has now become the protector of the world, have wrought great changes.  Most of the improvements of earth, most of the progress in the arts and sciences, most of the advance in civilization, have been wrought within the period of our state history.  Time would not permit, if the inclination were present, to account the achievements in the political, industrial, financial, agricultural, mechanical, scientific, educational, religious, or moral world.  Suffice it to say that in all of these Iowa has rendered her full share of service and has reaped her full measure of blessing.  We can well afford to leave to others the study of the past.  Let it be ours manfully to face the future, now more than ever big with possibilities and with careful glance ahead improve the present.</p>
                            <p>In all the grand exhibit of this remarkable exposition there is not found that for which our state has greatest reason to rejoice.  The product of the farm, for the orchard, of the garden, of the herd, of the dairy, of the factory, of the mine are here in great quantity and of superb quality.  Truly Iowa is great in territory, great in resources, great in product, but she is greatest of all in her children.  There is presented to my eye from this platform that which is infinitely more valuable than all herds and all harvests.  I see scattered through this audience many of the youth of Iowa.  They are from the city, from the town, from the hamlet and from the Iowa farm.  They are representatives of an aggregate of 700,000 of school age, and of an equal number who have just passed from educational tuition to face the activities, the anxieties and the achievements of manhood and womanhood.  These all belong to a generation which will surely be heard from.  Their fathers and mothers have been industrious, have been ambitious, have been hopeful and have been successful.  A generation thus circumstanced is always potential.  Dr. Strong tells of a township in the Western Reserve which was settled with an energetic, liberty loving, God-fearing, educationally inclined people, and which in a limited period furnished many members of the state legislature and the state senate, and from the little village of only a few hundred inhabitants men went forth to college professorships east and west, to the supreme bench of the state and to the United States congress.  The same author says:  "Northampton, Mass., has among its native and resident population over 400 graduates from colleges and other educational institutions; it has furnished the world with 114 ministers, eighty-four ministers' wives, ten missionaries, twenty-five judges, 102 lawyers, ninety-five physicians, seven college presidents, thirty professors, sixty-four other educators, twenty-four editors, six historians, twenty-four authors, two governors and thirty other state officers, twenty-five members of the state general assembly, two generals, six colonels, thirteen other army officers, thirty-eight officers of the United States, among them a secretary of the navy, two foreign ministers, a treasurer of the United States, five senators of the United States, eight members of congress and one president."  If a territory six miles square, under favorable conditions, can make such a record, what may we not hopefully expect from a territory containing 55,000 square miles, all of it settled, similarly peopled, and with conditions more favorable than Massachusetts ever enjoyed or Ohio ever possessed?</p>
                            <p>"Know thyself," said the Greek philosopher.  "Know thine opportunity," has become a companion and equally important maxim.</p>
                            <p>When you go home tonight, tell the children that the world is big and constantly expanding; that this day's experience has broadened your vision; that life has become more real and hope more ardent, and that both you and the world, and especially the state, expects something of them.  Wake the boy in the night, break in upon his dreams with stories of hopeful possibilities; watch the fire kindle in his eye, then let him dream again of greater things, of broader expanses, of higher altitudes, of nobler achievements.  Neglect neither seed-time nor harvest; watch the growing and maturing crops; watch and protect both flocks and herds; zealously guard the interests of the shop and the store and the office; but, above all, look well to the youth of Iowa, and to all things that shall conserve the generation whose footsteps crowd the threshold of the world's activities.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles made a response on behalf of the exposition management, and was followed by Congressman Robert G. Cousins of Iowa, who delivered the oration of the day.  Mr. Cousins said in part:</p>
                            <p>I have asked five of the ablest and most noted Americans what they regard as the chief thing or leading feature of the transmississippi region and they have invariably answered:  "Its men and women."  The other day I met one of the oldest settlers of eastern Iowa&#8212;one of those original, rugged characters, whose wit and wisdom has lightened the settlers' hearts and homes for many a toilsome year&#8212;one of those interesting characters who never bores you and whom one always like to meet&#8212;a man whose head is silvered and whose countenance is kind&#8212;and I asked him what he regarded as the principal feature of our transmississippi country, and he scratched his head a moment and replied:  "Well, I'm no scholar, but I've been round here nigh onto sixty years, and I reckon 'bout the most important things is the folks and the farms."</p>
                            <p>The men and women who settled the Hawkeye state were not those who expected to go back "in the fall," or as soon as they could prove up on their claims.  They were stayers.  They were not men to be discouraged by winter or by work.  They were men who knew that nobody ever amounted to much in this world unless he had to.  Most of them began simply with the capital of honesty, good health and their inherent qualities of character.  They built their cabins in the clearings and watching the smoke curl up in the great, wide sky, felt just as patriotic for their humble rustic homes as e'er did princes for their castles or millionaires for mansions grand.</p>
                            <p>Civil government proceeded in Iowa with its rapid settlement.  The pioneer became a model citizen.  He knew the necessity for the laws that were enacted.  He did not feel oppressed by government.  He had experienced the losses of robbery and larceny and knew something of the embarrassment and inconvenience of being scalped.  There was no hysteria about trusts and combines because they had practiced combinations themselves for mutual protection.  If any one would learn the true genius and examplification and philosophy of self-government, government of and for and by the people, let him study the records of pioneer life, the institutional beginnings and the evolution of their laws.  It would be worth our while on some suitable occasion when time permitted to talk over the interesting incidents of its territorial legislatures, the birth and growth of its statehood and the character of its officials.  But the greatness of our state is not contained in any name.  Its official history is the exponent of its industrial life and character.  Its greatness is the sum total of its citizenship.  In order to be just, John Jones, the average citizen, must be mentioned along with our most illustrious officials.  Somebody said that "the history of a nation is the history of its great men," but there is an unwritten history which that averment overlooks.  The growth of a state is the progress of its average citizen.  The credit of a commonwealth is the thrift of its John Jones and William Smith, and the character, prosperity and patriotism of the individual citizen is the history of Iowa.</p>
                            <p>Industry and nature have made the state of Iowa a creditor.  Her soil has always been solvent and her system of farming does not tend to pauperize it.  She is a constant seller and therefore wants the evidence of the transaction to be  unimpeachable.  She has more school teachers than any other state, except the Empire state, and only 3.6 per cent of her population are illiterates.  The state of Iowa has yielded the grandest dividends on her educational investments.  She has become illustrious on account of her enlightenment.  She has progressed further from "primitive indifferent tissue" than the land even of Darwin himself, and in her escape from protoplasm and prejudice she is practically out of danger.  Marked out in the beginning by the hand of God, bounded on the east and west by the two great rivers of the continent, purified and stimulated by the snows of winter, blessed with copious rainfall in the growing season, with generous soil and stately forests interspersed, no wonder that the dusky aborigines exclaimed when the crossed the Father of Waters. "Iowa, Iowa, beautiful land, beautiful land."</p>
                            <p>And now, my fellow citizens, a word about our great transmississippi region, the empire of the pioneers and of our country and its future.</p>
                            <p>We have on this side of the Mississippi river an area of 2,143,155 square miles of land, two and a quarter times the area east of the Mississippi.  You could put England, Ireland, Scotland, the German empire, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Spain and all of the United States east of the Mississippi into this transmississippi territory without touching California or Hawaii, and Admiral Dewey would still have the Pacific ocean and Manila with rope enough to lasso and hang the last enemy of the United States and civilization (and there would still be left for sale a few choice lots in Omaha and Kansas City.)</p>
                            <p>Being a perpetual creditor, on account of its vast productions, the western region and all its states have a common interest in the largest possibly employment of people in other avocations than producing food, because employment not only creates appetite, but likewise the financial ability to satisfy it.  The western region and its many <choice><sic>statess</sic><corr>states</corr></choice> also have a common interest in honesty.  Having given their labor for a large increase in wealth per capita&#8212;the largest of any section of the country&#8212;they are naturally interested in maintaining it.  No one has a greater interest in the vested value than he who has exchange his labor and his products for it, or who has a con-<unclear reason="torn"/>

                            accumulated wealth.  You labor today and accumulate thereby.  You may want to rest tomorrow.  You have been selling all these years.  You may wish to buy or build tomorrow.  The credit registered by your toil, frugality and prudence should be forever sacred.  The west should look to the future and think not only of its gains in one decade, but of the balance that will be to its credit in a hundred years from now.  Do not forget that the world must eat and that mankind is multiplying by the millions and that the Creator is not making any more land on this planet.  Hold fast to the heritage which God and the pioneers have left you and to the standard of integrity and value by which it was earned.</p>
                            <p>Let the future buy from you according to that same standard by which you have bought and by which your toil is measured in the present.</p>
                            <p>No one can foretell a limit of the possibilities of this great, producing, half-developed region for the future, with the United States forging to the front in the commerce of the world, claiming its coaling stations along the lines of trade in the uttermost parts of the earth and realizing more than ever before that it is a joint proprietor with the older nations of the earth in the great high seas.  Doubtless some people are over-reckless for expansion and some are so conservative that their intellectual estates seem almost in probate.  Commerce will not <unclear/> mountains, lays its cables underneath the billows of the sea and scorns the fury of its crests.  Commerce is a greedy, moiling, tireless spider, catching all the world in a web of iron, and it will weave its wires wherever there is life.  It has found the Orient and the Occident and it will never rest until it ties its cables to the poles.</p>
                            <p>America will build a greater navy and will build the Nicaragua canal and her merchant ships will take her commerce into all the harbors of the world and our battleships shall protect our commerce in its legitimate and rightful course.  The American flag shall be visible and revered away from home as it is loved and venerated here, and under it a free people shall thrive and multiply in peace.</p>
                            <p>What shall be the events of the coming century?  Probably with whatever degree of certainty we are able to comprehend the past and to understand the present, with that degree can we foretell the future.  Yesterday and today are the premises of a syllogism whose conclusion is tomorrow.  I believe there is a good reason for everything that happens to be in the universe.  The indications are that the great events of the near future shall be in line of commerce, as I have already indicated, of jurisprudence, of social economy, of science and of art.  The tendency of the times is to get rid of long established humbugs as soon as their copyrights expire.  So long as toil shall bend the back of man his brain shall question science for its mysteries, and so long as mystery remains to form the boundary line of knowledge the scientists will strive and strive and climb and climb and reach beyond those bounds.  They will make the electric current turn the wheels of all the world.</p>
                            <p>Emerson declared a little while before his death:  "We think of our civilization near its meridian, but we are yet only at the cock crowing and the morning star."  The future will verify Emerson.  The greatest alliance ever projected in history will be the alliance of American efforts and American interests.  Into the opening gateway of the twentieth century, hand in hand, shall stride our king of commerce and the queen of industry, the Sphinx-eyed scientist and his bride of art, the sturdy son of agriculture and the dreaming child of song, and their thought and toil and song shall glorify the Anglo-Saxon race and make our country great&#8212;essentially, exquisitely, magnificently great.</p>
                            <p>There were more solos by Nellie Mae Brewster and Mary Teresa Louthan, and a selection by the Iowa Agricultural College Cadet band.  The formal exercises were concluded by a dress parade on the Plaza by the cadet battalion of the agricultural college, and a reception at the Iowa state building.</p>

                            <p>Many a cow will go to bed unmilked tonight in Nebraska and Iowa.</p>
                            <p>"There have been more people come into the two depots here since Tuesday morning than during any previous five days of the exposition," remarked one of the busy depot policemen at noon today as one of the big excursions of The Omaha Bee pulled into the Burlington depot.</p>
                            <p>The congested condition of the depots and surrounding byways and highways throughout the morning appeared to make good the copper's observations.  From 7 o'clock this morning until noon the Tenth street viaduct was the most crowded thoroughfare in the city.  For a half hour after the arrival of each of the heavily loaded trains the viaduct was obscured from view by the throng that passed over it bound for the city and the exposition.  The street cars did not begin to haul all the people away from the depots although they were run at minute intervals and were so crowded that the car windows, as well as the doors, were used for ingress and egress.  Before 7:30 o'clock the street car lines leading to the grounds were doing an immense business, and people coming down town to work were surprised to see a balancing amount of traffic bound in the opposite direction.  And all through the throngs were the bright blue badges of The Bee excursionists.</p>
                            <p>If the early morning crowds were large those that appeared at the long and short depots towards noon were something enormous.  The heavy amount of travel from points on the B. &amp; M. road bespoke the success of the excursion arranged by The Bee.  It was estimated that over 4,000 persons had come in Burlington trains up until noon, and there were the regular trains and special trains scheduled to arrive this afternoon.  A great many of the excursionists of The Bee arrived on the two sections of train No. 92 at 11:40 a. m.  Each of these sections was made up of a dozen cars, and brought in great crowds from Nebraska points, the arrivals from Wymore, Beatrice and vicinity being especially large.  The express from McCook brought in so many Nebraskans that it had to be run in two sections.  Train No. 5, from Chicago, pulled in at 8:10 with two long sections, and was followed by a local train from the east in two sections.  The Creston local train at 9:15 had fifteen coaches, and all were crowded with Iowans to help celebrate their state day at the exposition.  The reports of afternoon trains from the west are that they will bring in several hundred more excursionists of The Bee.  The regular train from the west, due at 4 o'clock, is heavy, and between 5 and 5:30 o'clock three special trains from Alliance, from Holdrege, Edgar and DeWitt, and from St. Francis, Kan., will arrive.</p>

                            <p>All of the Iowa lines did a big business on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Every regular train carried from ten to fifteen cars, and many of them had to be run in two sections.  Between the arrival of the regular trains special trains from all parts of Iowa kept bringing thousands of Iowans into the two depots so fast that the approaches to the viaduct were jammed almost to suffocation.  That no one was hurt in the big crowds reflects credit on the depot policemen and passenger directors who had their hands full throughout the morning.</p>
                            <p>The Chicago &amp; Northwestern brought in about 3,000 people.  The "Overland Limited" train came in with two sections, the first carrying 150 exposition visitors and the second 850.  The Carroll local arrived at 9:40 in three sections, and all of them were heavily loaded, carrying not less than 1,700 people.  Another train from Cedar Rapids had ten cars with the Logan brass band and 800 people to contribute to the Iowa throng, and these had just found the steps up to the viaduct when a special train from Ames, Ia., pulled in at 11 o'clock.  Aboard of it were the cadets of Ames college, under command of Colonel Herman Knapp.  There were six companies of the soldier boys, with about forty men in a company.  As they marched up Tenth street they were greeted with loud applause.  Finding the street somewhat dusty and the sun more than warm, they called a halt near Harney street, and sat down on the <unclear reason="torn"/> to rest awhile.  A special train from Lake City brought in about 400 more happy sons and daughters of Iowa at 1 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>The Milwaukee road did a big business with the Iowans this morning.  Train No. 1, arriving at 8:20 o'clock, was so heavily loaded that it was run in two sections, both of which carried about 1,100 people.  A special train from Marion, Ia., arrived at 7 a. m., and brought in 600 exposition visitors who wanted to get an early start at the grounds.  The Manilla local, arriving at 9:15 a. m., did not bring in George Dewey, but it carried about 750 patriotic passengers from the neighborhood of that city and other points in Iowa between Perry and Council Bluffs, all bound for the great exposition.  The report from train No. 3, due here at 4:15 this afternoon, indicates that, too, is jammed full with 500 or more enthusiastic Iowans.</p>

                            <p>The Rock Island's business from its main line and branches in Iowa, especially from Des Moines and points this side of the Iowa capital, has been heavier during the last two days than for a long time.  All of the passenger equipment has been pressed into service, and some of the trains have filled up so rapidly soon after leaving Des Moines that they had to be run through points this side of Avoca, leaving passengers to wait for later trains, with the hope of being able to get on.  The governor's special, with Governor Shaw of Iowa and staff, arrived shortly before midnight with about 550.  The morning train from Chicago was a double-header, with fourteen cars and 800 passengers.  Thirty-three extra cars had to be ordered for the Iowa division today, and there is plainly use for all of them.  The trains from the east arriving over the Rock Island at 11:25 a. m. and at 1:25 p. m. brought in nearly 1,500 more Iowans to shout whenever the praise of the Hawkeye state should be sung at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Union Pacific carried all of its heavy travel on regular trains.  There were no special trains run, but the number of extra cars that had to be attached to the regular trains to accommodate the heavy travel would have made several big special trains in themselves.  Train No. 4 arrived before 7 o'clock with five extra cars.</p>
                            <p>The Columbus local pulled in at 9:40 with six extra cars.  The local from Stromsburg and Beatrice brought in three extra cars at 12:30, and the afternoon "Overland Limited" from the west is run in two heavy sections.</p>

                            <p>The Rock Island train that pulled across the bridge at 11 o'clock last night carried Governor Leslie M. Shaw of Iowa and Mrs. Shaw, with eleven cars solidly packed with Cornhuskers, who come to help celebrate Iowa day at the exposition.  The train began picking up exposition visitors at Davenport, where a good sized party got on, and there was a crowd waiting at pretty nearly every station between Davenport and Council Bluffs.  By the time the train reached the latter city the cars were literally packed with people who stood in the aisles by the hundreds after the seats were all filled.  The Rock Island alone brought in nearly 2,000 people to swell the crowd on the exposition grounds today.</p>
                            <p>The only other state official who accompanied Governor Shaw was C. G. McCarthy, auditor of state.  G. L. Dobson, secretary of state, and Treasurer Herriott could not get away at this time and several other officials were compelled by circumstances to postpone their trip until a little later.  But Both Governor Shaw and Auditor McCarthy were jubilant over the prospect for a tremendous crowd from their state.  They said that the people were coming by thousands and that they would show Omaha a crowd today that would put other state celebrations in the shade.  Governor Shaw and party are domiciled at the Murray.</p>

                            <head type="sub">From Northern Iowa.</head>
                            <p>Captain J. F. Merry, assistant general passenger agent of the Illinois Central and chairman of the committee on transportation of the Iowa Exposition commission, feels pretty good over the fact that a special train left Dubuque over his road at 6 o'clock yesterday morning and pulled in here last night over the Sioux City &amp; Pacific with 662 passengers aboard at 6 o'clock, all gathered up before the train got to Cherokee, where it left the main line and took the branch for Onawa.  As the Illinois Central does not class itself as an Omaha road, Captain Merry thinks this is a good showing.  He says it is the result of advertising and says he expects that the travel will continue as good from this out.  The special was in charge of F. D. Hadley, traveling agent of the line, with headquarters at Sioux City.</p>
                            <p>There were no special trains into the Webster street station this morning, but all of the regular trains had additional cars attached.  Travel from the north over the Omaha road, from the south over the Missouri Pacific and from the west over the Elkhorn was very heavy, but it was carried by regular trains.</p>
                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/>of the special trains from Iowa discharged a considerable part of their traffic at Council Bluffs.  This fact made travel across the two other bridges beside the Union Pacific's very heavy.  The big street cars from Council Bluffs were run at intervals of three minutes during the morning, and were packed on every westbound trip.  The new train service of the Omaha Bridge &amp; Terminal railway from Council Bluffs to the exposition grounds also accommodated a large number of Iowa visitors and the Union Pacific put on several additional bridge trains during the morning.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Not less than 10,000 people witnessed the sham battle between the Indians yesterday afternoon and when it was over and the dead and wounded carted away it was pronounced a great success.  It was fought along substantially the same lines as some of the others that have been put on and was carried out in every detail.  In addition to those who occupied seats in the reserved section and those who stood around the ropes there was the senatorial party and a number of the exposition directors.</p>
                            <p>The great fight of the afternoon was started off by Captain Mercer marching all of his Indians up in front of the reviewing stand.  The first detachment was composed of the interpreters, who clad in their new suits consisting of brown corduroy trousers, blue flannel shirts and light brown slouch hats made a very neat appearance.  Then came the squaws of the different tribes, each band coming up separately.  They in turn were followed by the Indians, marching the same order, after which the horsemen appeared on the scene, tribe after tribe riding up at full gallop and yelling their war whoops.  Behind each band rode its chief and as they reached the seats, the name of the tribe as well as the name of the leader was announced.  Old Geronimo appeared to be the lion of the occasion and was cheered from the time he started until he halted his animal in front of the stand.  The old man rode like a general and evidently appreciated the ovation, as he doffed his hat and bowed as gracefully as a Chesterfield.  This part of the program having been carried out, the Indians filed off over the field toward the east and back to the starting place, from which the horseman rode in a body, yelling in a manner that made some of the timid white people feel like talking to the wood.  After the sounds of the yells had died away, a volley was fired and everything was ready for the fight.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">What the Fight Was About.</head>
                            <p>As the story goes, a Sioux Indian, Grass, had been over in the territory of the Blackfeet trapping beaver and as the tribes were not on friendly terms he had been doomed to die at the stake, a slow fire doing the business.  Of course this was simply the play and in order to carry it out there had to be a battle.</p>
                            <p>After the parade the Sioux and their allies, under command of Goes-to-War, took up a position on the east side of the grounds, while the Blackfeet and their allies, led by Big Brave, went out into the space at the west end of the grounds.  Then everything was ready for business.  In from the west came a little band of Indians leading a horse, on which was mounted Mr. Grass.  He looked sad and his every action indicated that he was ready to expect almost anything.  It was not more than a minute before 100 Indians, painted and ornamented with feathers, hustled in from the same direction as came the men with the Indian who was to be tortured.  They whooped like mad and one of their number, Cut Nose, made a speech.  He told a tale of cruelty perpetrated by Grass and opined that he ought to die like a dog.  Grass smiled and told his captors to do their worst, as he was ready to die.  Then some of the fellows who were not singing war songs commenced to gather grass and straw that was lying conveniently around, waiting to be gathered.  Grass was pulled from his horse and roped to an electric light pole.  The next act in the war drama was to tie him good and tight.  After that a circle was formed about him and the war dance was put on with a war song accompaniment.</p>
                            <p>About the time the Blackfeet were ready to fire the straw around Grass' feet a runner came in and reported that two Sioux were out in the brush taking observations.  Big Brave selected a dozen of his most trusty warriors and sent them out to bring in the two men that they might be roasted with Grass.  The Sioux got wind of the proceedings and scudded over the prairie, but one of them was not swift enough and was captured and scalped, while the other managed to get back to his camp.  When the scalp was brought it the Blackfeet and their allies proceeded to have a <choice><sic>jolification</sic><corr>jollification</corr></choice> and then started a fire around Grass.  Their fun, however, was short lived, for about this time the Sioux came down upon them pell mell, firing into their ranks and knocking out a dozen of the best men.  The Blackfeet were routed and driven off, after which the Sioux had their fun.  They brought in ten prisoners and after releasing Grass, bound them all to the same electric light pole.  Then there was a Sioux war song and a dance that went with it and for a time it looked as though there was to be a hot time in the camp for several men and undoubtedly there would have been had not the Blackfeet gathered up a lot of reinforcements and renewed the attack.  They came in like the wind and engaged the Sioux.  They had but one motto and that was:  "When you see a head hit it."  The hitting process worked with both sides and for a time it was hard to tell which side would carry the day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Goes-to-War a General.</head>
                            <p>Up and down the field the contending forces fought, first one side having an advantage and then another.  Every protuberance upon the ground and every tree had its Indian and his gun behind it and whenever a head appeared it was shot at, many of the shots taking effect, causing scores of Indians to bite the dust.  At last the Sioux showed signs of weakening and it was right at this point that Goes-to-War showed that he is of the right kind of stuff.  Whenever he saw a band of Indians incline to show the white feather he rode out and urged them to return, telling them that their fathers never knew what it was to be whipped.  The words were like magic and many a wavering column was brought back to engage in the fight.  At last Goes-to-War seemed to be convinced that he was leading a forlorn hope.  He rode along the ambush line which his braves occupied and shouted to them to follow him.  Like one man the little band rose from cover and made a frightful charge, pouring blank cartridges into the enemy, and it is possible that the Sioux might have won the day had not Goes-to-War received a shot that sent him off his horse and rolled him in the dust.  His men rushed to his assistance, but it was too late, for the old man had fought his last fight and his spirit had gone to meet those of his fathers.  Seeing that their leader was dead the Sioux retreated in bad order and the battle was over.  Then it was that attention was given to the prisoners who had been bound to the stake, but this was unnecessary, as they had broken their bonds and had escaped.</p>

                            <p>W. B. Knistern, general passenger and ticket agent of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern railroad, and Will H. Clarke, secretary of the Union League club of Chicago, were among yesterday's arrivals.  These gentlemen come as a special committee accredited by Chairman William H. Harper of the Chicago day executive committee to make any remaining arrangements that may be necessary in connection with the Chicago day celebration.  They will remain in Omaha today and will then return to Chicago.</p>
                            <p>Both gentlemen were decidedly enthusiastic over the prospects for a large attendance from Chicago.  Mr. Clarke said that 250 people had already taken berths in the Union League club special, which will come over the Northwestern road.  The train will include a dining car and the excursionists will eat and sleep in the cars during their stay.  All the roads will run special trains for the occasion and the number of tickets already engaged indicates that they will have all the business they can handle.</p>

                            <p>The Dairy building is again attracting the attention of the butter producers as the September scoring of the butter is about to take place.  The scoring is set for Thursday and some of the butter is now on hand and in the refrigerating cases.  Minnesota is on hand and will make another attempt to take the lead, as it did at the scoring last month.  The butter producers of that state have sent in 2,500 pounds and have it arranged on the south side.  The indications are that double the number of entries made at the former scorings will be ready for the expert.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Bassett in the Dairy building is bending all of his efforts in the direction of making a fine cheese display.  At this time he is showing some very fine cream cheese from Holt county.  It came from the sand hill district of the county and is from milk of cows that were fed on the native bunch grass.</p>

                            <p>The Pueblo Indians are showing the kind of stuff of which they are made and instead of loitering about their tents they are making the necessary preparations for the erection of a habitation.  Yesterday morning they ordered a load of straw and had it dumped in the northwest corner of the Indian encampment.  Next, with hoes, spades and shovels they dug a pit.  Into this they poured water and threw in soft dirt and straw which they mixed thoroughly by tramping with their bare feet.  The mixing process was continued for a couple of hours.  After that they got out a number of moulds and went to making adobe brick.  Before night they had several hundred of these bricks out drying in the sun.  When a sufficient quantity is made they will be used in the construction of a house, made to resemble the ones that they live in when on their reservation near Santa Fe.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Conway of the government fish department has arranged to have a lot of new material shipped to Omaha, with which the exhibit will be rejuvenated for Jubilee week.  A new feature of the fish show is a lot of Quinnat salmon eggs, which have just been received from California and which will be hatched out early in October.  These eggs are about the size of a small pea and a black spot on each indicates the head of the embryo fish, while a lime of film shows what will sometime be a fish.  The fry will be about three-quarters of an inch long when they are hatched.  Superintendent Conway has shipped 5,000 black spotted trout, which have been hatched during the exposition, to the state hatcheries at South Bend.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Wonderful Automaton and Illusion of Rolla at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>To those who delight in an entertainment that leaves them in doubt whether they can trust the evidences of their own senses the Temple of Psycho on the East Midway offers one of the most fascinating features on the grounds.  This is comparatively a recent addition to the amusement section, but the marvelous illusion of Rolla and the phenomenal accomplishments of the <choice><sic>automatom</sic><corr>automaton</corr></choice>, Psycho, are already the talk of the grounds.  Psycho is represented by the head and shoulders of an Egyptian boy clothed in an oriental costume and artistically constructed of wire and wax.  The figure is set on a small square base which rests in turn on a transparent glass tube which shows that there is no connection between the image and the floor.  In front of Psycho are arranged cards bearing the numerals from 1 to 0.  Psycho will pick up any of these cards that may be named by anyone in the audience and never make an error.  As a further test visitors are requested to write any number on a card and without a word being spoken the automaton will pick out the number that has been selected.  How the trick is accomplished is a mystery of which no one has been able to offer an explanation.  Psycho does pretty nearly everything that a human being can do and is a puzzle to thousands of visitors.  The automaton was invented by Masaelyne, proprietor of Egyptian Hall in London, and conceded by scientists to be the best of the three famous automatons of the world.</p>
                            <p>Rolla is an even more mysterious personage.  A curtain is drawn back and reveals the head and body of a beautiful woman resting on a wooden pedestal.  This is a distinct advance in the science of illusion for it is not a reflected figure.  Visitors may step up and investigate the marvel to their full satisfaction.  They may shaky hands with Rolla, talk with her and otherwise convince themselves that real flesh and blood confronts them.  But try as they may they cannot discover that Rolla has any lower limbs.  The pedestal is supported by a small wooden upright and there is nothing in connection with the illusion that could possibly conceal the remainder of the figure.  The longer a visitors investigates the more mystified he becomes and the lecturer is obliged to assure him that there is a trick about it somewhere to dispel the conviction that it is really a half woman.</p>

                            <p>There was a birthday party in the Agricultural building yesterday.  R. R. Randall, who has charge of the Burlington exhibit, was the man who had the birthday.  He has had 69 before this one came around.  This time his friends thought that they ought to do something.  His friends are the other exhibitors and during the afternoon they gathered in the booth, each having some present to give him.  Prof. Atwater of the Texas exhibit, made the address, and during the course of his remarks stated that he was authorized to hope that Mr. Randall might celebrate seventy more such occasions.</p>

                            <p>The Medicine dance which was scheduled at the Indian encampment last night was postponed because the Apaches did not get their feathers in time.  Geronimo's braves determinedly refused to dance without feathers and the Cheyennes and Arapahoes went on instead.  The dance was a repetition of the ordinary figure with no particular significance.  The Medicine dance will probably be given tonight, and as it is an entirely new feature it will be of more than ordinary interest.</p>

                            <p>When the gates close tonight there will be a new record in exposition attendance.  Iowa nearly accomplished the feat and the Modern Woodmen will succeed.  The attendance up to 3 o'clock was several thousand in excess of that of yesterday to the same hour, and with a 25-cent admission tonight a record-breaking crowd is assured beyond reasonable doubt.  From 7 o'clock to long afternoon there was not a minute's cessation of the rush through the gates.  It seemed that the street cars were bringing all the people they could carry yesterday, but they are hauling thousands more today.  There was scarcely an hour during the forenoon at which there were not 200 people massed in line at the Twenty-fourth street entrance and at Sherman avenue the crush was almost as great.  The full force of ticket sellers was on duty, but by 10 o'clock the management was compelled to reinforce the department by employing new men.  Arrangements were also made to relieve the crush at the two main entrances by running some of the street cars to the Twentieth and Boyd street entrances.  With these provisions the crush was handled with admirable system and the people were passed into the grounds faster than they have ever been before.  There was a crowd everywhere.  The Auditorium, where the exercises of the day were held, was packed to suffocation.  The main court was solidly lined with spectators of the parade and the Bluff and north tracts were almost as thoroughly filled.  The immense crowd of yesterday seemed to have come back in full force and with it were mingled thousands of Woodmen, whose bright uniforms and pretty badges were everywhere conspicuous.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Got in Line Promptly.</head>
                            <p>The Woodmen who were to participate in the exercises of the day were commendably prompt in getting into line.  The parade of the uniformed camps around the main court started almost exactly at the designated hour and it was one of the prettiest pageants that has been witnessed on the grounds.  The participants consisted exclusively of well-drilled marchers, and their showy uniforms presented a variety of coloring that made the spectacle more than usually attractive.</p>
                            <p>The uniformed camps formed in front of the Electricity building promptly at 10:30 o'clock.  It was headed by the Fourth regiment band of Sioux City, which was followed by Sundance camp No. 184 of Sioux City.  The men were uniformed in white trousers and bright blue blouses.  They were followed by Gus Smith camp No. 2766 of Des Moines in uniforms of green and white, which were in pretty contrast to those of the Sioux City crowd, and then came Missouri camp No. 1893 of St. Joseph in handsome habiliments of maroon and white, which added another beauty to the galaxy of colors.  The members of Elm camp No. 1221 of Missouri Valley wore green and white, and behind them marched Mondamin camp No. 5170 of Mondamin, Ia., in picturesque red uniforms.</p>
                            <p>The combined effect of these brilliant contrasts of color was remarkably effective against the white background of the court and the effect was maintained by the various combinations which were displayed in the uniforms of the camps that formed the remainder of the procession.  These included Forester's camp, No. 1095 of South Omaha, Fullerton camp, No. 780 of Fullerton, LaRue camp, No. 1058 of Union, Woodbine camp, No. 1576 of Woodbine, Ia., accompanied by the Modern Woodmen band of Woodbine, Hazel camp, No. 4944 of Council Bluffs and Maple camp, No. 945, Beech camp, No. 1454, B. &amp; M. camp, No. 2722, Forester's camp, No. 120, Nebraska camp No. 47 and Hibbard camp, No. 4944 of Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Maneuver as They March.</head>
                            <p>The parade passed entirely around the main court and during the march the various companies executed a number of movements which elicited the vociferous approbation of the crowd.  The parade ended at the Auditorium, which was already densely crowded with Woodmen and their families, with the exception of a small space that had been reserved for the marchers.  They were greeted with continual cheering as camp after camp filed into the building and added its banner to those which already transformed the back of the stage into a solid mass of color.  All the head officials of the order were grouped on the platform and they joined heartily in applauding the magnificent showing of the uniformed detachments.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha Concert band played a couple of selections while the crowd was disposing itself in what seats remained, and then President Wattles introduced A. R. Talbot of Lincoln, chairman of the board of directors of the Modern Woodmen, as the presiding officer of the occasion.  Mr. Talbot explained that Governor Holcomb was unable to be present to deliver the address of welcome.  He added that while he could not fill the place of the governor of Nebraska, he could shake hands with them and give them as cordial a welcome as any other man in this jurisdiction.  He expressed the hope that this might be the brightest and happiest day of their lives and that its celebration might give new impetus to the magnificent order that they represent.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">What is Expected of Us.</head>
                            <p>Continuing, Mr. Talbot said that his exposition is the fruition of American thought, the embodiment of American pluck and enterprise.  To the transmississippi country the world looks for the highest expression of beauty, of energy, of business integrity and Christian endeavor.  It looks here for the highest type of "Home, Sweet Home," and it is for the protection of this home that the Modern Woodmen of America is organized.  He declared also that of all societies the Modern Woodmen is most closely in touch with the common people of the country.</p>
                            <p>The speaker emphasized the distinctions between the social cosmogony of this era and that of earlier times.  Caesar and Demosthenes talked to few people while the populace gathered by thousands to witness the brutal encounters in the arena.  Now the taste of the people inclines to beauty and art and oratory and such organizations as potent factors in working out the development of the race.  Whatever may be in store for the future this great order will have emblazoned over its doors the motto, "love thy neighbor as they self" and millions will join in singing its song of "Home Sweet Home."</p>
                            <p>President Wattles then gave the visitors a hearty welcome to the exposition grounds.  in doing this he paid a high tribute to the growth and value of fraternalism as represented by this organization.  He said that such a development of this sentiment is only possible in this country where the rights of the common people are protected and all men are equal.</p>
                            <p>The work of this society is especially valuable because its membership is very largely composed of the producers of this country.  If all its acts of benevolence, good well and charity could be gathered together and the <unclear reason="torn"/> had been benefited combined it might form a tribute that would be commensurate with this occasion.  Last year it disbursed $1,900,000 to those who had been bereft, and since its organization it has given nearly $10,000,000 to thousands, who bless this organization for the relief that came in their time of trouble.  In conclusion he expressed the hope that its future might be as bright as its purposes deserve.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Head Consul Northcott's Address.</head>
                            <p>After a selection by the Omaha Cornet band, W. A. Northcott, lieutenant governor of Illinois, and head consul of the order, was introduced and greeted with furious applause that merged into an ovation.  In beginning he made a patriotic allusion to the recent war which, he declared, had not tested the full power of the American republic, but had shown the world that the spirit of Grant and Lee was still alive.  In this connection he roused his audience to increased enthusiasm by asserting that if ever this republic should be in danger it would only be necessary to blow a blast on the Woodman bugle to bring together 40,000 disciplined men, thoroughly drilled and better than the soldiers that followed Caesar or Napoleon.</p>
                            <p>Glory and war are magnificent, he continued, but greater still is wisdom and peace.  The records of Him who died on Mount Calvary come down to us today, gentle as a summer zephyr, but enduring as time.  "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," <choice><sic>ad</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> the old question, "Am I my brother's keeper?" finds its answer in the fraternal organizations of today.</p>
                            <p>The speaker contended that in the condition of the common people lies the secret of national prosperity.  It is not the cultured few, but the education of the masses.  It is the school house in the valley and not the university on the hill.  It is not how many people are able to give their children a higher education, but how many can send them to the common schools every school day in the year.  He emphasized the value of fraternalism as an adjunct of this idea, and then proceeded to speak of the Modern Woodmen and the rapid progress that it is making.  He declared that the end of the year will see the total membership reach the 400,000 mark and that there is no limit to its future development.</p>

                            <p>The final address was delivered by Mrs. E. D. Watts of Omaha, supreme oracle of the Royal Neighbors of America.  The representatives of the feminine auxiliary of the order was given a still more enthusiastic welcome and her remarks were frequently applauded.  She discussed the part of the women in the work of the order and dwelt on the fact that the Royal Neighbors are also in a process of gratifying <choice><sic>developement</sic><corr>development</corr></choice>.  She emphasised the value of the auxiliary which she contended was indispensable to the full measure of the prosperity of the order.</p>

                            <head type="sub">President Sterrett of the State Commission Tells the Story.</head>
                            <p>OMAHA, Neb., Sept. 21.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  The editorial in this morning's Bee, "What's the Matter with Missouri," makes some erroneous statements, which, in the interest of truth and individual Missouri patriotism, must not be permitted to remain unchallenged.  "Missouri could, if so disposed, have made the most magnificent showing in the Agriculture building, and yet it is distanced by Oklahoma and Kansas in the variety and quality of its products."  We will not undertake invidious comparisons between Missouri and other state exhibits, but, outside of ornamentation, no state in the building has a better variety and quality.  Missouri has made more entries for awards than any state in the Agriculture building.  Missouri is one of the few states which makes a display of native grown cotton.  Missouri is the only state that has grouped the grasses in the order of their usefulness, and challenges the exposition to compare with it in grasses, at any stage of the proceeding.  Again, you say, "For the first three months after the exposition opened, the space allotted to Missouri in the Agriculture building consisted of a pyramid of flour sacks and a reception room for stray Missourians.  This meager exhibit was finally reinforced by a collection of cereals, but it is far from creditable."  The fact is that before the exposition was a month old Missouri had every glass case used at the World's fair at Chicago by Missouri, with additions to the same, amounting in all to more than 300 cases, filled with cereals, fully installed and a greater number of cases than had then been, or has yet been installed by any other state to this date.  Within one month from the opening of the exposition Missouri had more samples of wool on exhibition than she had at the World's fair, at which time there was a state appropriation of $150,000, while in this exhibition less than $15,000 was obtained by individual subscriptions and nearly all the labor of installation and 
                            
                            <pb n="216" xml:id="TMISB06-216"/>
                            
                            maintenance has been done gratuitously by patriotic Missourians.  At the World's fair Missouri carried away more premiums than any other state in the union and, outside of ornamentation, has a better display here than at that time.</p>
                            <p>"While nearly a million and a half of people have passed through the gates, it is not too late yet for Missouri to make a decent showing."  The inevitable inquiry, after the above, is, is the Negro exhibit, the only distinct state exhibit of its kind here, a decent exhibit?  Every intelligent person who has seen it pronounces it very and highly creditable.  Is the "Woman's Work" exhibit from Missouri the only distinct state exhibit of its kind on the ground, decent?  It has been praised on alls ides for the comfort it has provided, and the tidy exhibition of woman's work from Missouri.</p>
                            <p>Is the Educational exhibit of Missouri, installed and maintained by the superintendent of public instructions for Missouri, and the faculty of the State university, a decent exhibit?  Critics pronounce it at least, the second in importance in the exposition.  The dairy exhibit from Missouri attracts more attention than all other dairy exhibit combined.  The Horticultural exhibit from Missouri has now on record 165 scorings with a maximum of 100.  Does any other state surpass this?  Missouri is the only state that gave a good fruit show from the opening day.  The mining exhibit is a better commercial exhibit than Missouri had at the World's fair, where we took twenty-two awards in this department.  All of the seven departments of exhibit from Missouri are not only decent, but are creditable.  The agricultural has not been all that we intended, but it has been at no time discreditable, and there has been no time when it did not have more specimens than any other state.  We were unable to expend as much for ornamentation as states which appropriated $5,000 and $10,000 for such purposes.  The agricultural exhibit is daily being reinforced by the best material from the country fairs, which will continue to be held until October 15.  Among the latter shipments are splendid specimens of yellow Indian corn, sixteen inches in length, some of it now on the writer's desk, and plenty of it in the exhibit.  On yesterday Hon. W. B. McRoberts of Monticello, Mo., and Colonel G. W. Waters of Canton, Mo., went down the line of state exhibits in the Agriculture building with specimens of this corn and said at each state headquarters, "Gentlemen, this is our best.  Can you beat it?" and nothing was shown that did beat it, and likely nothing will be.  The answer to your headline, "What is the matter with Missouri," is "Why, she is all right," and the appropriation by the legislature would have been all right, too, if it had been properly presented.</p>
                            <p>Your editorial also says:  "Another very singular thing about Missouri is the inexplicable indifference shown by the metropolis of that state in failing to avail itself of the opportunities afforded by the exposition to cultivate and extend its trade relations."  You should know, in this relation, that St. Louis citizens subscribed two-thirds of all the funds that went to make up the Missouri exhibit and enabled the commission to pay the exposition authorities about $3,300 for space in which to make their state exhibit; and, that without St. Louis contributions, there would have been no exhibit at all from the state of Missouri.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Nebraska as Usual Makes a Hit with the Crowd.</head>
                            <p>There was a great crowd in the Horticulture building all day yesterday.  The crowd started in early in the morning and was still in evidence when the gates closed last night.  It seemed as though everybody was anxious to see the kinds of fruit raised in the transmississippi region.  Some of the exhibitors were ready for the crowd and others were not.  The maddest men in the building were those who had charge of the Oregon, Idaho, Colorado and Illinois exhibits.  They expected an abundant supply of new fruit from home and it did not come.  The result was that they had to show exhibits that had been on the tables for a number of days and while they were in fair condition, they were not the kind that the superintendents wanted to put out on Iowa day.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska made another of its big hits and had its tables filled with the freshest and best that the orchards can produce.  Superintendent Youngers, in charge of the Nebraska exhibit, sent word out to the growers of the state that he wanted to make a great showing and they all responded.  He had apples, such as are seldom seen in this section, great pears, grapes in endless varieties and dozens of varieties of peaches, as fine as those grown in California or any of the states that boast of raising the best peaches in the world.  Not content with this, he made a large exhibit of Nebraska grown figs, sent in by "Uncle Bob" Furnas, and bushels of pawpaws, a fruit that is supposed to have had its origin down in southern Indiana.  The exhibit proved a great surprise to the visitors and it was apparent that such a showing was not expected.  The most surprising thing to the visitors was the dozen plates of cherries.  All of the people knew that the cherry season was over a couple of months ago, but Nebraska has the fruit and it is just as fresh as though picked from the trees only yesterday.  Of the cherries there are half a dozen varieties and the explanation offered for their being on exhibition is, "Nebraska can raise anything that any other state can grow, and what is more, it can show it at any season of the year."</p>
                            <p>Douglas county got to the front and Superintendent Walker made the greatest exhibit of grapes ever seen in the building.  He had thirty-four separate and distinct varieties on his tables, while of plums, he showed sixteen varieties.  Then he had apples, peaches and pears in such quantities that many of the Hawkeyes were led to believe that this is the greatest fruit section in the world.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Collman spruced around and put his exhibit from Iowa in the best possible condition.  He rearranged his plates and made everything presentable.  The exhibit was greatly admired and was the objective point of many a delegation from Iowa.</p>
                            <p>The red apples from Missouri and Kansas drew a <choice><sic>godd-sized</sic><corr>good-sized</corr></choice> crowd, the members of which examined the exhibits and felt pretty satisfied that these two states are doing their best to assist in the fruit show.</p>

                            <head type="sub">INDIANS PUT ON TWO DANCES.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Red Man Gives an Exhibition for White Brother's Edification.</head>
                            <p>The Indians played to good sized and appreciative audiences both afternoon and evening yesterday.  There were dances on both occasions and the people who witnessed them were nearly all strangers in the city.  A horn dance was scheduled for the afternoon, but it was not put on.  In its stead something over 100 of the Indians came upon the grounds.  As on previous occasions, most of the Indians were stripped to the skin, with the exception of the breechclout.  The decorating was done in the most artistic style, blue being the prevailing color, though red and green gave it a close race.</p>
                            <p>When time was called that everlasting drum was brought out and placed in the center of the ring, after which six Indians, with Pretty Bear as chief drummer, started the music.  In a very short time the painted dancers filed in from their wigwams, carrying guns, shields or wands and started the step and for a couple of hours they stepped it off at a lively rate, stopping only when they were exhausted.</p>
                            <p>The dance was one of those that is participated in before the braves go to war and while the Indians consider it of a religious character, white people do not.  As they dance they sing a mournful melody, the principal feature of which is a request to the Great Father to bring them all home alive and assist them in slaughtering the enemy.</p>
                            <p>A bow dance by the Arapahoes was carded for the evening, but it, like the horn dance that had been advertised for the afternoon, did not come off and Captain Mercer had to fill up the program by chasing his own northern Indians into the ring.  Runners were sent to the different lodges and in less than fifteen minutes 100 Indians appeared, in full dress, or rather undress, ready for the party.  For a couple of hours they danced one of their everyday friendly dances and the people went away immensely well satisfied.</p>
                            <p>Today is the regular day for the sham battle that is to be called for tonight and in which all of the Indians of the camp will <choice><sic>particiapte</sic><corr>participate</corr></choice>.  In addition to this, Prof. Mooney has advertised a Wichita Horn dance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COMMISSIONER JONES IS PLEASED.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Head of the Indian Bureau Talks of the Exposition Congress.</head>
                            <p>Commissioner Jones of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, who has been in the city several days, returned to Washington last night.  While here the commissioner spent considerable of his time at the Indian camp, conferring with a number of the leading Indians with reference to their needs on their respective reservations.  He held a long conference with Geronimo, the noted Apache chief, and upon its conclusion he said that he is glad to know that the old man is rapidly adopting the ways of the whites.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Jones in speaking of the work of the Indian congress said in his judgment Captain Mercer has worked out the details in fine shape and is doing everything that lies in his power to acquaint the white people with the home life of the Indian.  The exhibition has been a pleasing one to Commissioner Jones, who says he feels a great interest in the Indians and their future, believing the time will come when they will entirely abandon their tribal relations and accept the methods and customs of the whites.</p>
                            <p>Relative to Indian schools, Commissioner Jones said:  "At this time we have between 20,000 and 25,000 Indian children in school.  They are bright and learn rapidly.  The greatest drawback to the eduction of the Indian is we cannot furnish them all with employment after they graduate from the schools.  At school they adopt the ways of the whites and  many of them continue to follow them after they return to their homes.  Our records show that 76 per cent of the Indians who have been educated are doing fairly well, that is, they have not gone back to the blanket.  Some are farming, others are raising cattle or working for white men who are in the stock business and a great many are employed by the government as interpreters.</p>
                            <p>"The eastern school has had much to do with the improved condition of the young Indian and has had much to do with showing them that eventually they must become self-supporting.  I am in favor of the reservation schools, but think that they should be used as preparatory for the students entering the schools where trades are taught in connection with the ordinary branches.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Street Demonstration Not the Least Feature of the Celebration.</head>
                            <p>While the great proportion of the Iowa visitors came to the grounds during the forenoon enough remained to constitute a very respectable parade to escort the official party.  The presence of the cadets from the Iowa Agricultural college imparted a military tincture to the pageant and there were half a dozen bands to furnish the inspiration for the long march from the hotel to the grounds.  The parade left the Murray hotel at 12:30 o'clock in charge of Commandant Knapp of the cadets.  The Council Bluffs contingent, consisting of Governor Shaw and staff, Adjutant General Byers and staff, Mayor Jennings and prominent citizens in carriages, left the city across the river at noon.</p>
                            <p>The parade was headed by the Ames Agricultural college band, followed by the First and Second battalions of college cadets.  Governor Shaw and his staff and Adjutant General Byers and staff mounted were preceded by the Logan band.  Following the citizens of Council Bluffs in carriages came prominent citizens from all over the state.  There were twenty carriages in all.  In the first rode President Wattles of the exposition, Hon. R. G. Cousins, the orator of the day; General Barry, and C. G. McCarthy, Iowa state auditor.  Among other prominent Iowans in carriages were the following:  Judge and Mrs. Deemer of Red Oak, V. P. Dawson, Hon. Lafe Young, S. C. McFarland, John H. Wallbank, Judge Robinson, J. E. E. Markley, R. S. Bandy, A. B. Cummings, J. Y. Stone, F. N. Chase, G. M. Parker, Hon. L. M. Jaeger, J. E. Rowen, Thomas Arthur, George McCoid, Owen Lovejoy, Robert Moore and A. D. Huston.</p>
                            <p>The procession was received at the Sherman avenue entrance by General Manager Clarkson and a squad of exposition guards and it passed on to the Plaza by way of the Iowa building where it was greeted with cheers by the enthusiastic Hawkeyes who packed the broad verandas.  At this point the Eldora Ladies' band fell into line and their pretty uniforms added a femininely picturesque element to the spectacle.  The parade passed up the East Midway and over the north <choice><sic>vialuct</sic><corr>viaduct</corr></choice> and thence through the West Midway and the main court to the Auditorium.  This was already so densely packed that only a small proportion of the marchers could secure admittance and the others made the best of it and started out to see the show.</p>

                            <p>Like white men, the Indians have an idea that in order to have <choice><sic>bood</sic><corr>good</corr></choice> luck and keep out of harm's way it is the correct thing to have a mascot.  They have wanted one ever since they came into camp, but not until yesterday did they find just what they wanted.  Now they have a live mascot and it is Francis, the 5-year-old son of George Stewart, interpreter for the Crows.</p>
                            <p>In the last Indian battle George and a young brother rode a burro and were immediately nicknamed the "Two Little Black Crows."  As they were getting out of the way of the fighting Indians, High Wolf, the chief of the Cheyennes, suggested that the elder lad would make a good mascot.  The suggestion was taken up and yesterday the lad was given the job.  He was painted like a veteran warrior and dressed in the most fancy garb conceivable.  There was not much of this garb, however, as it consisted only of a breechclout as big as your hand and strips of fur around his ankles.  It was enough, though, and as the little fellow pranced into the ring and danced and sang he not only amused the white people but the Indians as well.</p>

                            <p>After the exercises in the Auditorium yesterday the crowd was informally received by Governor Shaw and the other state officials at the Iowa building.  The reception was a sort of go-as-you-please in view of the tremendous crowd that filled the building, and hundreds of visitors improved the opportunity to meet the Iowa officials.</p>
                            <p>At 4:30 o'clock the two battalions of the Iowa Agricultural College Cadets, commanded by Captain Herman Knapp, put up a very pretty exhibition drill on the Plaza.  The drill was somewhat abbreviated, as the cadets had already done a good deal of marching during the day, but it was a very meritorious exhibition.  There were upwards of 200 cadets in line and they showed a precision of movement that was highly creditable to their instructor.  The drill was witnessed by a good crowd and heartily applauded.</p>

                            <p>The Iowa day program was rounded off with a magnificent display of fireworks on the North tract.  All of the 5,000 reserved seats were occupied and fully as many more people watched the bombs and rockets from the outside of the ropes.  There were the usual number of rockets and shells, but the set pieces were prepared especially for the occasion.  There was a fine portrait of Governor Shaw, shown in colors, and in addition there were the huge stars and the walking elephant.  The "Welcome, Iowa," elicited a round of generous applause, while the naval flight between the two American boats and the Spanish war ship was cheered and cheered.</p>

                            <p>It is possible that the famous Mormon choir of Salt Lake City, Utah, will be one of the attractions at the exposition during Jubilee week.  Negotiations for their appearance here are now pending, and although there is now a slight hitch about terms it is probable that this will be removed and the great chorus choir of the west secured.</p>
                            <p>It will be recalled that the Mormon choir proved a great attraction at the World's Fair, and on the way to Chicago the singers stopped off at Omaha and delighted an immense audience at Boyd's opera house until a late hour one evening.</p>

                            <p>The drill of the life-saving corps yesterday afternoon was enjoyed by nearly 15,000 people.  The entire circle of pavement from the Government building to the bridge was jammed with spectators, to many of whom the exhibition was a novelty.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation left last night for Washington, where he will complete arrangements for the transportation of the presidential party to Omaha on Jubilee week.  He was accompanied by E. C. Snyder, private secretary to Senator Thurston.</p>
                            <p>Another date has been set for the celebration of Missouri day, which was postponed earlier in the season.  The event is now scheduled for October 4 and it is believed that by that time the torpidity of the Missourians will begin to yield to the exposition enthusiasm that is extending all over the west.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock received a telegram yesterday from the Port Arthur officials, which stated that they had made a rate of less than 1 cent a mile from Quincy to Omaha for Quincy day.  The Quincy demonstration occurs Friday and the railroad people are confident that they will haul a big excursion from that point.</p>
                            <p>H. M. Poe, a rustling and leading real estate man of Norton, Kan., has about the best collection of farm photos, parks, feed yards, harvesting and threshing scenes that is shown in any state building.  This you will find in the Kansas state building to right of the registering stand in main room.  Mr. Poe was formerly from Richardson county, Neb., and has many friends, we find, among the Nebraskans.</p>
                            <p>The presence of the Ladies' band of Eldora was a very pretty incident of the Iowa celebration.  The women who compose the organization wear a very tasteful uniform, which consists of a blue skirt, short blue blouse trimmed with gold braid, white shirt waist with a black bow and black hats trimmed after a common design of lace and feathers.  Bands from Avoca, Carroll, Mason City and Logan were also in evidence during the day.</p>

The entire membership of the Iowa exposition commission was on hand, a bright badge of yellow ribbon fluttering from the breast of each member.  The other visiting Iowans were designated by a button badge bearing a photograph of the Iowa state building and the date of the greatest day the exposition has yet witnessed.</p>
                            <p>A number of Iowa's distinguished citizens, and also of former residents of that state, mingled with the party and joined in the procession to the grounds, among them being Congressman R. G. Cousins, C. G. McCarthy, state auditor; ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, President Wattles of the exposition; Adjutant General P. H. Barry of Nebraska, Judge J. S. Woolson of the United States circuit court in the southern district of Iowa; Judge Deemer of the Iowa supreme court and his wife; Lafe Young of Des Moines, Lieutenant Governor Milliman, A. B. Cummins of Des Moines, John Y. Stone of Glenwood and J. D. Bowen.</p>
                            <p>The parade was one of the longest and most imposing of the many parades in connection with the exposition.  The military features were especially striking and the long line of carriages extended for a distance of several blocks, the entire length covering fully twenty blocks in length.</p>
                            <p>Governor Shaw and staff, all mounted, with the governor leading the way on a handsome dapple gray, were the center of interest in the imposing procession.  The members of the staff were Adjutant General M. H. Byers of Des Moines, Colonel C. G. Saunders of Council Bluffs; Colonel H. H. Rood of Mount Vernon; Colonel James T. Priestly of Des Moines; Colonel A. B. Shaw of Des Moines; Colonel F. C. Letts of Marshalltown; Colonel E. G. Pratt of Des Moines; Colonel C. E. Putnam of Cedar Rapids; Colonel William Larrabee, jr., of Clermont; Colonel Sears McHenry of Dennison, and Colonel McGarraugh of Des Moines; Color Sergeant George F. Hunt, Quartermaster Sergeant Byers.</p>
                            <p>Major W. C. Wyman of Des Moines remained to accompany Mrs. Shaw to the rounds.  Accompanying the governor's party by special invitation were Lieutenant W. L. Murphy of Council Bluffs, who was with his regiment, the Twenty-fourth regulars at Santiago; Lieutenant Lincoln of the same regiment, and Colonel W. B. Humphrey of the Fifty-second Iowa, who had also gotten home from the war.</p>
                            <p>Following the gubernatorial party in carriages were these prominent citizens of Council Bluffs:  William Moore, J. C. Mitchell, John Beno, C. F. Wright, J. B. Hess, A. C. Graham, Judge N. W. Macy, Judge W. I. Smith, Judge E. E. Aylesworth, V. E. Bender, Lucius Wells, Finley Burke, Rev. W. S. Barnes, D. C. Bloomer, M. F. Rohrer, Rev. J. P. McDonald, S. B. Wadsworth, W. S. Baird, N. C. Christensen, F. T. True, F. A. Bixby, W. B. Reed, J. W. Bates, D. A. Caspar, Thomas Bowman, E. W. Hart and H. W. Binder.</p>
                            <p>The procession, which formed at the Murray hotel, was led by a platoon of Omaha police, mounted.  Then came two battalions of cadets from the Iowa agricultural college at Ames, under the command of Captain Herman Knapp, who also acted as marshal of the day.  The first battalion was in charge of Major Goble and the second in charge of Major Clark.  The cadets made a fine appearance in their neat blue suits and were accompanied by an excellent band composed of students.  The Logan band, consisting of eighteen men under the leadership of John Crossley, followed.  Next came Governor Shaw of Iowa, accompanied by his staff.  The carriages containing members of the Iowa commission and prominent citizens from all over the state were the next in line.  Albin Huster's band from Council Bluffs, twenty-five strong, led the last division, followed by the High school cadets of Council Bluffs.  There were fifty young men in line, under command of Captain O. G. Butts.  Their marching was finely done, especially when it is taken into consideration that it is the opening of the school year and but little drilling has been had for the last three months.  Prominent citizens of Council Bluffs in carriages closed the parade.</p>
                            <p>At the exposition grounds the procession was met by Major Clarkson and conducted to the Iowa building, through East and West Midway and down to a position north of the Administration building.  The Iowa Agricultural college cadets marched through the Administration building, past the lagoon to a point south of the Boys' and Girls' building, where they dismounted and marched to meet Commandant Knapp and his cadets.  The procession then marched to the Auditorium, arriving at 2:30 p. m., where the public exercises in honor of Iowa day were held.</p>

                            <p>The great majority of the people came in at the Burlington and Union depots, but the arrivals at the Webster street depot were on the same large scale.  The Missouri Pacific brought in four extra coaches attached to the regular trains, all being crowded, the Omaha road hauled three trains of seventeen coaches, and the Elkhorn brought in twenty coaches, mostly from Iowa.</p>
                            <p>A careful estimate of the number of people coming in yesterday morning on the railways places the figures at about 30,000.</p>
                            <p>The Council Bluffs contingent was the largest, as might be expected.  A large number of visitors stopped there Tuesday night and yesterday on their way in from the east and then took the motor line for Omaha.  Before 9 o'clock the big coaches were filled to overflowing, although every car in the establishment was brought into requisition.  This lasted, with slight intermissions at times, until after Governor Shaw and his attending party arrived at noon.  Then the employes had a breathing spell.  Nearly all the business houses in Council Bluffs being closed for at least a part of the day, clerks and employers were given a chance to take in the exercises of the day, of which they took advantage so generally as to tax the means of transportation to the utmost.  The crowds were good natured, however, and put up gracefully with what little inconvenience was necessary.</p>
                            <p>A large number of people went from Council Bluffs direct to the exposition grounds by way of the Terminal railway and the new bridge, taking in the parade on the grounds in preference to witnessing it from down town.</p>

                            <p>With them came Lieutenant W. L. Murphy, a Council Bluffs boy who has been well known in this vicinity from boyhood.  He graduated at West Point last June and was detailed at once to the command of a colored regiment of regulars and sent at once to Santiago de cuba.  Both he and his regiment distinguished themselves on the battlefield, and as a mark of especial consideration Governor Shaw invited him to take a position on his staff, which Lieutenant Murphy did.</p>
                            <p>There were plenty of band uniforms in sight about the hotel lobbies.  One of the best of these was that from Carroll, Ia., consisting of twenty-two men under the leadership of Charles Jones.  During the forenoon they tendered the World-Herald and enjoyable serenade.</p>

                            <p>And the ticket-sellers found out what a big crowd is.  At the Twenty-fourth street entrance the people were backed up from the ticket windows clear to the street.  It was much the same way at the Sherman avenue entrance and at the Horticulture building entrance.  The latter was the nearest way to the Iowa state building, and naturally fully one-half going out on the Sherman avenue line got off there.  In the first hour 3,000 persons had passed in at this one entrance.</p>
                            <p>It presently appeared that it was the Fourth of July over again, and even better than that.  Gatekeepers began talking about an attendance of 30,000.  Then it went up to 40,000, and soon to 60,000.</p>
                            <p>By 10 o'clock the big reception room of the Iowa building was jammed so that one could hardly get through.  A like fate speedily overtook the Government building, and directly the Fine Arts and other main court buildings and the Midway began to feel it.</p>
                            <p>In fact, the grounds were covered with people.  The Midway usually does not get well waked up until about noon.  But it was different this morning.  It had to get to business earlier.  The various employes and the dancing girls who go it till midnight had to rub their sleepy eyes, don their garb and go at it again.</p>

                            <p>At the Iowa building Secretary Chase and the commissioners were busy.  Guards at the doors handed out to every comer a button badge with the state building and tasty lettering on it.  The building had been beautifully decorated.  Broad festoons of the material colors had been poured over the front and extended the entire length of both wings.  In less than an hour all the porticos were full, and during the forenoon entertainment was afforded in turn by half a dozen different bands from as many different places in Iowa.  The Ladies' band of Eldora naturally attracted much attention.  It comprises E. E. McElhinney, leader; Julia Jahnson, Fannie Crockett, Ida Jones, Ole Jahnson, Jennie Pool, Lynn Horner, Jessie Moorman, Emma Brooks, Bessie Ellsworth, Lura Hauser, Gilbert Jahnson, Belle Pool, Clara Williamson and Anna Jahnson.  The girls are arrayed in a smart uniform of blue and soon made themselves great favorites.  As one listened to the pretty music, the fullness of the sounds made him feel that masculine lungs must be behind the horns.</p>
                            <p>An interesting features of the building was the check room.  It was piled high in about five minutes, although it is a large room.  From the Iowa building the stream would overflow to the other state buildings, where every registry clerk was as busy as he could be, and to the Pottawattamie county wigwam.  This was a delight to Superintendent Graham.  He had been expecting it and had prepared for it.  And those who went in here found a very handsome display.  Several tons of grapes, as fresh and full as ever were seen, were attractively displayed by the Southwestern Iowa Grape Growers' association.  One design was a cornucopia, much noticed and admired.</p>
                            <p>All of the Iowa commissioners are here save President Mallory and Mr. Erwin.</p>
                            <p>Thirty thousand of the button badges had been prepared.  Souvenir programs were distributed at the same time.  The program is a little pamphlet, a model of neatness and elegance.  It has a full page half tone of Governor Shaw, and page cuts also of the state building, the exhibit in the Agriculture building and of the wigwam.</p>

                            <p>Today the exposition entertains the officers and soldiers of the Twenty-second United States infantry and the blue and gold of Uncle Sam's service succeeds the more gorgeous colors of the fraternal organizations that predominated the day before.  It was intended that the day should be a merry holiday for the soldiers, but when the column wheeled through the gates its meager numbers impressed the spectators who had gathered to welcome the regulars with a sentiment that was more pathetic than joyous.  Hundreds of those who saw the regiment enter the grounds this morning were also present when it started for the front and when they saw less than 200 officers and men to represent the magnificent organization of a few months ago they almost forgot to cheer as they thought of those for whom the exposition gates could never open.  But if the soldiers shared the sentiment it was not apparent.  Few of them had ever seen the exposition before and as they confronted its magnificent proportions they could express only surprise and admiration.  They lost no time in scattering over the grounds in an enthusiastic effort to see the whole show during their holiday and in half an hour the service uniform was in evidence all over the inclosure.</p>
                            <p>The soldiers arrived at the north gate just before 10 o'clock in the special train that was provided for their use by the Missouri Pacific railroad.  They were met by General Manager Clarkson, who informally welcomed them to the grounds, and by A. J. Webb of the Admissions department, who attended to the ceremony of running them through the gates.  Ranks were broken without delay and the rank and file were turned loose until dinner time, while Major VanHorn, Captain Jones, <choice><sic>Lieuetnant</sic><corr>Lieutenant</corr></choice> Hall and other officers were conducted to the Administration Arch by General Manager Clarkson and provided with such information as might assist them in making the most of their day.</p>

                            <p>Although the Twenty-second was stationed at Fort Crook only a short time before the commencement of hostilities, there was no lack of friends to assist them in the enjoyment of their picnic.  Some of them broke up into small groups, but not a few were seized upon by feminine admirers and hustled off to be lionized.  But these felicitations were necessarily brief for at noon the mess call brought the soldiers to Markel's cafe, where an abundant repast had been spread by the order of the exposition management.  The long tables in the south casino were amply sufficient to accommodate the entire party, and after all had been comfortably seated the officers withdrew and joined General Manager Clarkson at lunch on the other side.  In neither case was there any speechmaking or formality.  The grub was produced in abundance and the soldiers showed their appreciation by getting outside of it with the same enthusiasm that they exhibited in fighting Spaniards around Santiago.  When all had been satisfied they dispersed again to spend the remainder of the day and evening according to their various inclinations.  The train will leave the grounds at 9:30 tonight, thus giving the regulars an opportunity to see the <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>A large excursion from Quincy, Ill., is also scheduled today, but up to noon the party had not arrived at the grounds.  The Port Arthur officials said that the train was on the way and would probably arrive early in the afternoon.</p>
                            <p>While the crowd that assisted to welcome the soldiers seemed slightly emaciated after the tremendous crush of the two preceding days it was considerably better than the average of the last few weeks.  The street cars were running as frequently as the day before, but they were only comfortably filled instead of being jammed until there was no chance for a fly to light on the footboards.  Tomorrow will be Traveling Men's day and it is expected that several hundred drummers will be on the grounds.  It will also be a holiday for about 800 poor children from Lincoln, who will visit the show as the guests of D. E. Thompson of that city and be entertained by the Board of Women Managers.</p>

                            <p>The record of exposition attendance went to smash yesterday.  The attendance of 44,452 which was registered July 4 and which has since remained the high water mark was easily exceeded and from now on there is a new mark to aim at.  Iowa came very near accomplishing the feat the day before and yesterday the big celebration of the Modern Woodmen of America brought the additional visitors that were needed to complete the achievement.  The old record, which had stood unchallenged for eighty days, was knocked into smithereens and the event was welcomed by the management as a substantial <choice><sic>indicatiaon</sic><corr>indication</corr></choice> of the unprecedented crowds that are promised for the remainder of the show.  That the new record cannot enjoy the long life that was granted to its predecessors is conceded, but so long as it may be permitted to stand it will be treated with reverence.</p>
                            <p>When the magnificent showing of Iowa day was known it was scarcely expected that yesterday would show such additional strength.  But the gates were not open two hours before it was apparent that the day would at least crowd the record closely.  From 7 o'clock to long after noon there was not a minute's cessation of the rush.  It seemed that the street cars were bringing all the people they could carry the day before but they hauled thousands more yesterday.  There was scarcely an hour during the forenoon at which there were not 200 people massed in line at the Twenty-fourth street entrance and at Sherman avenue the crush was almost as great.  The full force of ticket sellers was on duty, but by 10 o'clock the management was compelled to reinforce the department by employing new men.  Arrangements were also made to relieve the crush at the main entrances by running some of the street cars to the Twentieth and Boyd street entrances.  With these provisions the crush was handled with admirable system and the people were passed into the grounds faster than they have ever been before.  There was a crowd everywhere.  The Auditorium, where the exercises of the day were held, was packed to suffocation.  The main court was solidly lined with spectators of the parade and the Bluff and north tracts were almost as thoroughly filled.  The immense crowd of yesterday seemed to have come back in full force and with it were mingled thousands of Woodmen, whose bright uniforms and pretty badges were everywhere conspicuous.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FRUIT GROWERS HAVE A CROWD.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Horticultural Exhibits Inspected by a Tremendous Throng.</head>
                            <p>Even the Horticulture building with its wide aisles and passageways was in a congested condition during the greater portion of yesterday.  The crowd started early in the morning and kept on coming until late at night.  Thousands of people left the street cars at the entrance to the grounds in the rear of the Georgia building and for hours they put in their time visiting the Horticulture and the state buildings.</p>
                            <p>At not time since the opening of the exposition has the Horticulture building been so thronged with people.  They were not those who give exhibit a hurried look and pass on, but instead they were men and women who discussed the fruit, talked of the lands where it was matured and then carried away all of the literature that they could secure bearing upon the subject of fruit culture.  Most of the exhibitors were ready for the big crowd and had their exhibits in fine condition for exhibition.</p>
                            <p>In the Nebraska exhibit the show of apples was something that astonished even the veteran fruit raisers who were in the great mass of people.  The back shelves in the exhibit had been filled with last year's apples and they were as sound as dollars and absolutely free from spots.  In fact, it was as fresh and in as fine condition
                            
                            <pb n="219" xml:id="TMISB06-219"/>
                            
                            as though picked yesterday.  On the lower and front tables new fruit in endless quantities was piled upon plates.  There were dozens of varieties of pears, peaches and grapes, while there appeared to be no end to the varieties of plums.  The apples shown were as fine as any in the building and those that attracted the most attention were "Pound Sweets."  These apples under ordinary conditions weigh in the vicinity of one pound each, hence their name.  Those shown in the Nebraska exhibit and raised in the southern part of the state tip the beam at from two to two and one-half pounds each, while occasionally there is one found that weighs as much as three pounds.  Many people who visited the building yesterday insisted that the great globes were pumpkins and would not be convinced that they were not until one of the apples was cut open.</p>
                            <p>The Douglas county exhibit was ready for the crowd, but in order to have it in perfect condition it was necessary for Superintendent Walker to spend the entire night driving among the farmers, selecting just what he wanted for the fruit show.  He found it and yesterday he had the finest collection of apples, grapes, plums, pears and peaches that he has shown since the opening of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Oregon exhibit was rejuvenated yesterday by the receipt of a fine collection of Gravenstein apples, Beurre, Clairgean and Vicar of Wakefield pears.  Superintendent Courtney is still in great need of fruit for his exhibit and is expecting it daily.  Of late the growers in Oregon have not been shipping the fruit at regular intervals, which has resulted in the exhibit being somewhat ragged at times.</p>
                            <p>Assistant Superintendent Barnett of the Illinois exhibit found himself yesterday with nearly half a carload of fruit sent on by Superintendent Stanton, who went home a couple of weeks ago.  Mr. Stanton has written saying that the farmers of central Illinois are all talking of the exposition and that thousands of them will be in attendance.  He adds that the exposition is discussed almost as much in Illinois as though it was an exclusively local enterprise.  Mr. Stanton will not return to Omaha until the last of next week, when he will bring with him the best of the horticultural exhibits and hurry on with them.  The collection of horticultural products received from Illinois yesterday included apples, grapes, pears and quinces.  At this time the state is making a great run on pears and quinces and is showing fully thirty varieties of the former and half a dozen of the latter.</p>
                            <p>Idaho's exhibit received a valuable addition yesterday in a shipment of fruit from the Snake river valley.  The fruit was raised at an altitude of 4,500 feet.  It has a delicate color and a rich, fine flavor, superior to fruit grown on low lands in the irrigated districts.  The collection includes peaches, plums, three kinds of crab apples, two kinds of prunes and three varieties of apples.</p>
                            <p>Iowa, Kansas and Missouri made some slight additions to their exhibits and had them in good presentable shape.</p>
                            <p>The men in charge of the county exhibits from Colorado are disconsolate and at the same time they are the maddest parties in the Horticultural building.  When they came here in charge of the exhibits they were given to understand that fruit would be shipped at least as often as once per week and that it would be in quantities sufficient to keep the exhibit in good condition.  Up to date the shipments have not been coming and consequently the <choice><sic>exhibts</sic><corr>exhibits</corr></choice> are suffering, as the supply is running low and also because the stuff that is being shown shows the effects of age.</p>

                            <p>In the words of a once locally famous orator of the Black Hills section, "The war whoop of the savage is no longer heard in the foot hills," but the savage who raised the war whoop is not so far removed from the times when his voice rang by day and night along the war trail or in pursuit of the hunt.  This is why the sham battles at the exposition are given with such unquestioned unction by the red men who during the brief hour of their participation turn back in memory to days before the white men came to end forever the savagery of aboriginal life.</p>
                            <p>Thirty-five bands from as many tribes were marshaled yesterday under Captain Mercer, warriors, pappooses and all, before 10,000 visitors who crowded about the ropes.  But yesterday the war whoop had no terrors.  The streaks of red and yellow paint added only interest to the beholders.</p>
                            <p>The Indian loves nothing better than to fire a gun.  Map out for him a general plan and his intuitiveness will supply the details.  And so he entered into the sham <unclear reason="torn"/> he had not become so glazed over with civilization as to forget that once his boast was his bravery, agility and endurance, more than his beauty or his wits.</p>
                            <p>The plan of the battle yesterday was much the same as that of Tuesday.  The Sioux, Wichitas and Arapahoes were at war with the allied bands comprising the remainder of the congress.  The allied bands had captured a prisoner and were about to burn him at the stake.  The captive was brought out and with stoic indifference allowed himself to be tied to the tree.  Big Brave, chief of the allies, made a speech which was interrupted by shouts of impatience by the group of warriors around the circle.  Finally the straw was lighted by a spark from a piece of flint and the flames began to lick the captive's feet.  Just then the enemy under Chief Goes-to-War, having been appraised of their comrade's danger, rushed to the attack, rescued the captive and drove off Big Brave and his allied tribes.  In their turn they made preparations to burn a prisoner who unluckily failed to escape.  The allies returned and the engagement became furious with the forces evenly matched in valor and skill.</p>
                            <p>Hand to hand the warriors grappled, while every tree and shrub sheltered its band of reds.  Back and forth across the field with the fortunes of war hovering now with the allies and now with the men of Chief Goes-to-War, charge followed charge and retreat followed retreat.  Big Brave rallied his men again and again and Goes-to-War led his braves to a renewal of the conflict at each sign of weakening.</p>
                            <p>The air became dense with smoke.  Goes-to-War gathered his band for a last attack.  The charge was met by the allies with a stubborn resistance.  The chief fell from his horse and many of his comrades lay dying beside him.  The remainder fled in confusion to their tepees at the east end of the enclosure.  When the smoke rolled away the dead warriors who had fired all of their ammunition and lay strewn about the ground jumped up and joined in the grand review of the Indian congress.</p>

                            <p>There has been another change in the date of Missouri day.  It was set for October 4 at the beginning of the week, but now the members of the Missouri commission have decided that October 10 will be more satisfactory.  This will bring their celebration in Jubilee week and the commissioners are now confident that they will bring a big crowd.  Yesterday a telegram was received from the Missouri Pacific headquarters at St. Louis that a rate of 1 cent a mile would be granted for the occasion from all Missouri points.  This is the concession that the commission has demanded and on account of the failure to secure which the original Missouri day was postponed.  Immediately after receiving the news President F. M. Sterrett of the Missouri commission wired every newspaper in Missouri of the fact and urged them to begin booming Missouri day and keep it up until October 10.  At the same time he communicated with each county in the state and started preparations for the organization of parties of excursionists in each county.  In another day or two the enterprise will be actively pushed in every section of the state and he is confident that his state will make a showing that will be commensurate with its industrial and mineral importance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">One of the Peaceful Ceremonies of the Tribe Exhibited.</head>
                            <p>The premier attraction at the Indian encampment last night was a fire dance by the Apaches, which was one of the most interesting terpsichorean novelties that has yet been pulled off by the aborigines.  It was the first performance of this dance and it proved highly amusing to the good-sized crowd that witnessed it.  The fire dance is purely a peaceful demonstration.  It is a sort of jollification that comes into <unclear reason="torn"/> are piled high with buffalo humps and juicy antelope steaks.  It lacks the fiercer sentiment that would prevail if the hunt had been after scalps instead of buffalo meat and there is always joy in the wigwams when the braves dance its fantastic measures around the fire.</p>
                            <p>Five of the Apache braves participated in the dance last night and their makeup was suggestive of the shapes that creep into the dreams of a man who has feasted on lobster and chop house salads.  Their naked bodies were daubed with black pigment that glistened in the firelight like polished steel and over this were painted the most fantastic symbols that a savage imagination could suggest.  Their heads were covered with hoods of buckskin that fitted like the fingers of a glove and apparently shut out every particle of air.  To these were fastened elaborate headgear, patiently constructed of wood and feathers, and the whole effect was indescribably weird and striking.</p>
                            <p>To the weird droning of the squaws and the measured beating of the drums the dancers slowly circled around the blazing fire that occupied the center of the enclosure.  As the music quickened they gradually dropped into the savage figure of the dance, while the bells on their arms and ankles jingled in perfect time to the music.  Then they formed in a line on one side and went through a variety of fantastic evolutions that undoubtedly meant something to their Indian auditors, but which were incomprehensible to the crowd.  This was repeated again and again until the warriors puffed through their buckskin hoods like a mogul on a slippery track.  With a final whoop of triumph they slipped away to their wigwams and a lot of other braves entertained the crowd with one of the ordinary dances that have become so familiar to exposition visitors.</p>

                            <p>The flax enthusiasts who are at the exposition are planning to have Secretary Wilson of the Department of Agriculture give them a talk upon flax culture when he comes here with the presidential party.  They have arranged a meeting for Monday night, to be held at the Press buildings when the details looking to the securing of Secretary Wilson for a talk will be taken up.  October 8-10 George Loppens, who is said to have invented a machine for taking the gum from the fiber, will be here and will talk to the flax people.</p>
                            <p>The National Flax Fiber association has been organized, most of the members being exhibitors connected with the Agriculture building.  In the association are such people as Mrs. Oberg of Minnesota and Miss Ford of North Dakota.  The former was the judge in the linen fiber departments at the World's Fair, and a woman who has worked unceasingly in trying to have mills established in the northwest, where the flax fiber may be worked up.  Miss Ford has done much to induce the people of North Dakota to go into flax culture and now she is endeavoring to interest capital in the location of mills in that state, where the raw material may be manufactured into cloth.</p>

                            <p>There will be but one cheese exhibition in the Dairy building and this one will be about the middle of October.  Entries will be received up to October 12.</p>
                            <p>While only sample cheese has been sent in up to date, there is a general feeling prevailing among the dairymen that the exhibit will be unusually large and that the quality of the exhibits will be the finest ever seen.  Discussing this subject, Secretary Stauffer said:  "Everything points to a great cheese exhibit, not only from this, but from all of the transmississippi states.  Many of the dairymen of the states other than Nebraska are making inquiries relative to the entries and the conditions exacted by the exposition.  "We are living right in the center of a great cheese producing region and there is no reason why we should not make the best article ever shown to the public.  The other states are going to do their share and it is pretty certain that Nebraska will not be far behind when it comes to awarded the prizes."</p>

The exercises will be held in the Auditorium at 2:30 o'clock.  Ex-Governor Hoard of Wisconsin and Secretary Colburn of the National Dairymen's association will be present.  The address of welcome will be delivered by W. F. Poynton, who is a member of the Nebraska State Dairymen's association.

Miller, who is in the east as a special representative of the exposition, is being extensively interviewed in the press of central New York, where he formerly resided, and has made a number of speeches in support of the exposition.  In Utica he addressed the Chamber of Commerce and urged the people of that city to co-operate in making New York day a tremendous success.  In his old home in Syracuse he exploited the exposition in a two-column interview in the Post and also related a number of reminiscences of his life in that city half a century ago.</p>

                            <p>Arno Dosch, son of Exposition Commissioner Dosch of Oregon, and who has been spending his vacation assisting with the Oregon exhibits, has returned to college at Princeton.  While here the young man made a great number of friends, especially among the old-time Princeton students.</p>
                            <p>All the state buildings were made headquarters for the Woodmen yesterday.  While the headquarters of the order are permanently located in the Nebraska building, the superintendents of the other buildings made arrangements to check the axes and other baggage of the visitors and to afford them every possibly courtesy.</p>
                            <p>There was another immense crowd at the fireworks last night and fully 10,000 people were packed into the north tract besides those who watched the display from other parts of the grounds.  The set pieces included portraits of W. A. Northcott and C. W. Hawes and a handsome representation of the insignia of the Modern Woodmen.</p>
                            <p>In spite of the immense crowd of yesterday, no serious accidents occurred.  Over fifty cases were treated at the emergency hospital, but most of them were indispositions that yielded immediately to treatment.</p>
                            <p>D. E. Thompson of Lincoln, who will give all the children of that city who are unable to pay their way a holiday at the exposition tomorrow, telephoned Secretary Wakefield last night that he would bring not less than 800 children.  Mr. Thompson pays the entire cost of the trip and his party has increased to nearly double the number that was anticipated.</p>
                            <p>The band of the Genoa Indian school that has been giving daily concerts at the Indian congress grounds for the last two weeks continues to draw large crowds.  The band is composed of Indian boys, who are pupils of the Indian school at Genoa, in this state, and is considered to be one of the best bands in the state.  Its concert before the fireworks on the evening of Iowa day was much enjoyed by the thousands of people who came to see the magnificent spectacle.</p>

                            <head type="sub">First Ascension to Be Made by the Signal Corps from the Exposition Grounds.</head>
                            <p>The big war balloon that was almost shot to pieces before the battle of Santiago will be on exhibition next Monday at the exposition, back of the Cyclorama building on the Midway.  The entire exhibit will be completed before the end of the week and will include the balloon which saw actual service July 31, a similar one and twenty-four smaller ones, which are used to locate the positions of the signal corps.  These are colored red, white, blue and striped.</p>
                            <p>The large balloon will be fitted with all the apparatus necessary for actual service, including photographic, telegraphic and telephonic instruments.  It will be sent up 2,500 feet and held to that height by an insulated cable made of twelve strands of copper wire.  Through this communication will be held between the men in the balloon and those on the ground.  The balloon is of silk, thirty-three feet in diameter and fifty feet high, including the basket.  It will contain 21,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas, which will be generated on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Balloons have been used in warfare for many different purposes, but the main one and the one for which the balloon which will be on exhibition was constructed, is to observe the location of the enemy, their fortifications and the lay of the land surrounding the field of battle, including the roads, fences, streams and wooded tracts.  These observations are made partly by the telescope.  But for accuracy of detail resort is had to the telescopic camera, which will take a perfect picture at the distance of five miles.  The conditions of the weather, however, have much to do with the success of the observations.  All this work is done quickly and easily by two men.</p>
                            <p>Besides the balloon an exhibition of signals will be made on the grand court by Captain Yancey and his men, showing the systems of heliographic searchlight and torch signaling and the wigwag of flags.  The latter is called the Myer system and the same code is used as in naval signaling.</p>
                            <p>Captain Yancey has with him twenty-three men, including Sergeant Ivy Baldwin, who superintended the operations at Santiago and was the first to go up in it.  The men are all members of the signal corps.  Part of them were stationed at Tampa and the others come from Washington.</p>
                            <p>The balloons will remain on the grounds until the close of the exposition.  Exhibitions of signaling will be made at frequent intervals, which will be announced hereafter.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The sixth annual meeting of the Western Travelers' Accident association was opened this morning at 10 o'clock in the council chamber, city hall, with 150 members in attendance.  The association is not confined to the western states, as the name would indicate, but drummers from many states of the union are on its roll of membership and several have come from a great distance to attend the meeting.</p>
                            <p>E. S. Streeter of Omaha, president of the association, called the meeting to order.  Mayor Frank E. Moores delivered a short address of welcome and presented the boys with the golden keys of the city, saying in part:</p>
                            <p>I know of no body of men who ought to be more cordially welcome to our city than the traveling men.  At least this should be true of every live, progressive city, and that is the kind of a town Omaha claims to be.  We are glad to see you because you represent the thrift, the commercial activity and the general prosperity of the times and we feel that you are in a large measure responsible for these conditions.  Only a few years ago depression, business stagnation and bankruptcy were present on every hand, caused by lack of confidence.  Traveling men were called off the road.  But after the dark night of financial gloom the light of returning confidence began to break, presaging better times.  Enthusiasm and confidence are contagious and I believe that the traveling men, with their cheerful faces and warm handshakes, had a great deal to do with hastening the return of prosperity.</p>
                            <p>I <choice><sic>congratulte</sic><corr>congratulate</corr></choice> you gentlemen on the splendid business condition now prevalent in all parts of the country.  About a year ago many persons urged the exposition management to secure statuary for the grounds which should illustrate the history of the transmississippi states and a heroic sized Indian in the act of spearing buffalo met with popular favor.  Were I asked to name a subject, I should suggest a traveling man, grip in hand, in the act of rushing to catch a train.  He would express the life, the energy, the push and the enthusiasm which have transformed the great American desert into a paradise and peopled it with the most progressive and intelligent people on the face of the earth.</p>

                            <p>At the close of the address the mayor presented the keys to the city to President Streeter, who accepted them on behalf of the association, saying that by Monday the knights of the grip would have the town decorated with the national colors.  They would put on the first coat, red, tonight; tomorrow the second, white, at the White City; and Sunday the prevalent hue would be blue.  He then delivered to the association the president's annual address, reviewing briefly the history of the association since its organization, September 24, 1892, the cost of membership and the advantages to be obtained therefrom and the benefits of the emergency fund.  He called upon the members to each constitute themselves a <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Following the address of President Streeter the report of the expert accountant was read, showing that the association is in excellent financial condition and that the treasurer's books during the year ending September 22, 1898, have been kept with strictest accuracy.  The report showed that the total receipts during the year were $14,344.87.  The <choice><sic>disbursemments</sic><corr>disbursements</corr></choice> were $13,981.28.  In the fund the report showed that the receipts were $4,920, the disbursements $750, leaving a balance in the emergency fund of $4,170, and the total balance in the treasury $4,533.59.  The reports of the chairman of the executive board and the secretary were passed until the autumn session.</p>
                            <p>F. E. Haley of Des Moines, secretary of the Iowa State Travelers' <choice><sic>asosciation</sic><corr>association</corr></choice>, was called upon and gave a short talk on the relations existing between that society and the Western Travelers' Accident association.  The president then announced the following committees:</p>

                            <head type="sub">Competitive Drill a Great Sight&#8212;Beech Camp Wins.</head>
                            <note type="handwritten">Woodman</note>
                            <p>The most interesting feature of <choice><sic>Modren</sic><corr>Modern</corr></choice> Woodmen day was no doubt the competitive drill of drill teams, which began on the grand plaza at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  A large part of the plaza had been fenced in with rope, and the friends of the team and the visiting Woodmen generally crowded about.  No one knows just how many were there, but several very intelligent people were heard to express the opinion that everybody on the grounds was there.  They were incredulous when told that a bigger crowd was watching the life-saving exhibition, and that just as big a crowd was on the Midway, and that still just as big a crowd was moving to the Indian congress grounds to witness the sham battle.  Certain it is that it was hard to look in any main or minor point of the compass without seeing people, and lots of them.</p>
                            <p>The three judges were all chosen from the Second Nebraska volunteer infantry.  They were Colonel Bills, Lieutenant Colonel Olson and Captain Campbell of company F.  C. W. Hawes of Rock Island, head clerk of the Modern Woodmen, and Colonel A. W. Hollister of Madison, Wis., acted as timekeepers.</p>
                            <p>The teams had five minutes for a preliminary drill, fancy or whatever each team saw fit to make it, and then the ax manual was required for a finish, the former counting 50 and the latter 50 per cent.</p>
                            <p>Twenty teams paid the entrance fee of $5, but only twelve took part in the competition.  They were the teams of Gus Smith camp, 2766, Captain Joe Leggett, Des Moines; Capital City, 969, Captain A. C. Herrick and Drillmaster W. C. Rhode, Lincoln; Omaha, 120, Captain H. Martens, Omaha; Sundance, 184, Captain S. A. Miller, Sioux City; Midland, 1990, Captain Bob Stewart, Kansas City; Missouri, 1893, Captain Bart Devoise, St. Joseph; Cass, 332, Captain H. S. Barthold, Plattsmouth; Kansas City, 2002, Captain Martin Boison, Kansas City; Beech, 1454, Captain J. C. Page, Omaha; Foresters', 1095, Captain J. C. Colley, South Omaha; Hazel, 171, Captain Selby, Council Bluffs, and B. &amp; M., 2722, Captain E. B. Ferries, Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The first prize was $100, the second $75, the third $50, the fourth $25 and the fifth $15, the entrance fees to be divided pro rata among the winners.</p>
                            <p>For two hours and a half the great throng of spectators saw some fine drilling, and everybody agreed with Colonel Bills when he said, on awarding the prizes, that the poorest team deserved great praise, considering the fact that the discipline was not military and the drill voluntary.</p>
                            <p>It was remarked that most of the teams did best on the preliminary drill, and that the falling down was on the ax manual, comprising movements similar to the familiar military movements.  This was most noticeable in the case of the Kansas City team.  Its preliminary drill was almost perfect, and applause after applause came from the audience, but it went to pieces on the manual.</p>
                            <p>The prizes were announced at the Woodmen headquarters in the <choice><sic>Nebrasa</sic><corr>Nebraska</corr></choice> building an hour after the drill closed, and were as follows:</p>
                            <p>First, Beech camp of Omaha, 87½ per cent; second, Gus Smith camp of Des Moines, 80 2-3 per cent; third, Foresters' camp of South Omaha, 80 per cent; fourth, Omaha, camp 120 of Omaha, 77 2-3 per cent; fifth, B. &amp; M. camp of Omaha, 76 per <choice><sic>sent</sic><corr>cent</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>Of course the Beech boys went wild on the announcement of the decision, and carried Captain Page about on their shoulders.  It had been the general prediction that this team would win, for it had missed no part of the program and its movements had been very regular and exact.</p>

                            <p>Wildest and most fantastically weird of all the Indian dances was the fire dance given last evening at the Indian village by the San Carlos and Chiricahua bands of Apache Indians.  Only the medicine men and the most richly dressed women participated.  Half a dozen braves were gaily attired with satanically painted bodies and faces and headdresses of the lightest woven and decorated wood thirty inches in height, spreading to the same width at the top, paralleling the face.  And then there was a fine king with body painted a cream color, and not enough clothing to flag a wheelbarrow.  He was a clown, and his antics were immense, as he watched and imitated the impish dance and movements of his black compatriots around the big fire in the center.</p>

                            <p>The movement of visitors in the city yesterday forenoon was a double affair.  The excursionists that made the attendance 39,000 Wednesday and 53,000 Thursday had to get home some time, and the greater part of them took a took a notion to start home yesterday.  They had had lodging places in the north part of the city, and so all the street cars coming south were for several hours heavily loaded.</p>
                            <p>But others had come in to see the exposition, and they loaded down the cars going north.  So the street railway company had plenty to do both ways.</p>
                            <p>It has been observed that the big days of the week are Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and Friday has always been marked by a falling off in attendance.  It is so today, but the decrease is hardly so noticeable as before.  There are no great special features today, but yet people are coming to see the show.  The Elkhorn road, for instance, brought in a long train with a double header at 10 o'clock.  It was estimated that the attendance today would be in the neighborhood of 30,000.  Certainly it is the largest attendance that the exposition had had on a Friday.</p>

                            <p>The main incident of the day was the entertainment on the grounds by the exposition management of the Twenty-second United States infantry.  It is observed with sadness that there are not so many of the boys as when the regiment went away to Cuba.  The number is 166.  They came up from Fort Crook on the Falls City exposition special of the Missouri Pacific at 10 o'clock.  They occupied the two rear coaches of the train.  The regiment was in command of Major Van Horne, who was accompanied by his son, a member of the Sixteenth infantry, and to whom belong the distinction of having planted the first United States flag on a Spanish fortification in Cuba.</p>
                            <p>The arrangement of the exposition management that there should be no marching and no addresses or parade was very pleasing to the soldiers.  They had had enough of marching to do them for a time, and they did not care to go to a room and listen to speeches.</p>
                            <p>At the railroad entrance the regiment was met by General Manager Clarkson.  The troops were lined up on the platform, and for convenience sake walked by twos into the grounds.  They broke up at the Transportation building, and every fellow went where he pleased.  The boys showed the good effects of the rest and the care that they had had since getting back to the fort, and even some of the tan that they wore back from the southern clime is beginning to fade.  They took care to have all their uniforms looking bright, and the public gave them not a demonstrative, but a most respectful reception, made silent rather by reflecting on what the boys had so gloriously passed through and by the number that had been left behind than noisily joyous by the appearance of the survivors.</p>

                            <p>The war department exhibit in the government building will soon be increased by the addition of a lot of bronze cannons captured from the Spanish at Santiago.  Seven six-inch and three four-inch guns have been shipped to Omaha and are expected to arrive within a few days.  Just why so many guns of one kind were forwarded is not disclosed, but they will undoubtedly be the center of interest when they are installed.  The notice of the shipment of the guns does not state their character, but the fact that they are of bronze leads to the conclusion that they are of an antiquated type.</p>
                            <p>In addition to these guns the famous war balloon which was in active use at Santiago and was riddled with Spanish bullets is in the same shipment.  This balloon is unfit for service, but will be suspended in the Government building in full view of visitors.  It is about thirty feet in diameter and about fifty feet in height, being the same size and type of balloon as the large ones which are to be exhibited in actual use under the direction of Captain Yancey of the volunteer signal corps.</p>
                            <p>Captain Yancey's equipment of signal apparatus is to be increased by the addition of a field telegraph train, which has been shipped to Omaha.  This type of train is used on the battlefield and during active service for connecting corps and division headquarters or other distant points by telegraph or telephone.  It is capable of extremely rapid manipulation, it being possible to erect a mile of line in a hour or even less.  It is Captain Yancey's intention to exhibit this apparatus in actual operation by erecting a line on the exposition grounds.</p>

Nothing but the biggest kind of an attraction succeeds in making the Saturday crowd compare with those of the middle of the week and that of today is all that could be expected.  The only really considerable Saturday attendance was July 16, when the Third regiment of Nebraska volunteers was welcomed and then it only barely exceeded 20,000.  With the usual Saturday night local patronage it promises to equal the figure today.</p>
                            <p>No merrier party has been on the grounds than the train load of children that came from Lincoln this morning.  These were little ones whose parents could not afford to send them with the previous excursions.  They had been compelled to stand on the street corners and see their schoolmates whirled away to the big show and then listen to their stories of the wonderful things they had seen with the sorrowful conviction that they could never see these wonders for themselves.  But the practical philanthropy of D. E. Thompson of Lincoln gave them the opportunity that they had longed for and a happier crowd than these boys and girls appeared when they landed on the grounds this morning would be hard to find.  Many of them were shabbily dressed, but they were all clean and radiant with happiness.  Each child was tagged with a big yellow badge and then they were turned out to luxuriate in the beauties of the exposition with all the enthusiasm of children to which everything they saw was a revelation.  There were over 700 children in the party and their unconcealed enjoyment of their holiday gave pleasure to everyone who observed them.</p>
                            <p>All today's visitors came to see the show and there was no attempt at ceremony.  The traveling men did not appear until in the afternoon and then they proceeded to take in the grounds with the peculiar zest of their craft and in this the passenger men were a hustling second.  Many of them will remain over Sunday and it was their unanimous expression that they would stay a week if they could.</p>
                            <p>The farewell concert of the Mexican band tonight is expected to draw a large audience of those who have experienced so much pleasure in hearing the excellent performances given by this organization during its six weeks engagement.  The musicians are tremendously pleased with the appreciation that they have received and they are decidedly reluctant to leave the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Government Preparing to Put Down a Sample Piece of Steel Track.</head>
                            <p>Something that will interest and instruct every believer in good roads, whether an urban or rural resident, is to be the ocular demonstration of the steel track for common roads to be laid north of the dairy building at the exposition by the Department of Agriculture as a part of the government exhibit here.</p>
                            <p>E. G. Harrison of Washington, D. C., the United States special agent and road expert of the road inquiry division of the Department of Agriculture, has a sample of this track here and the work of laying it was commenced this morning under the personal supervision of Martin Dodge, the government director of the road inquiry division.  It is the intention to have the track in shape by Monday.  Mr. Harrison has seen several of the county commissioners and they will pay particular attention to the workings of this kind of road.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wilson of the Agricultural department believes that steel track for common roads will in time prove a big thing for the west, especially in view of the cheapness of the cost for which this kind of rail can be made.  Something was done in this direction while J. Sterling Morton was secretary of the department, but the idea has received an impetus greater than ever under Mr. Wilson.</p>
                            <p>The track will be 180 feet in length and on a dead level.  Material enough for a 600-foot track was brought here, but there is not room enough for it all.  It is not necessary that the road ordinarily shall be level.  The rails are flat, eight inches in width, with a sufficient flange, and stand on a concrete bed.  They are laid standard gauge, of course, and are wide enough to accommodate the heaviest and widest wagon tire.  No wood is used whatever, the hails being held together by means of steel ties about seven feet apart imbedded in the concrete.  The construction offers no obstacle, as the track is easily crossed without jolting, the flat rails being very little above the level of the road bed, almost imperceptibly above the bed.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the track is completed tests will be made of the power required to draw any kind of a load from one up to ten tons.  On a dead level one horse can easily pull ten tons.  A man is said to be able to move a load of two tons with one finger.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Agriculture is proceeding about its demonstrations of the efficacy of this kind of a track in a conservative manner, though there have been several samples of it laid in various parts of the country.  This will be the first public test.  The one great object is to show that with a little cost the track can be laid on country roads, and at a great saving to the horseflesh of the farmers.</p>
                            <p>Iron roads are no new thing in the country.  Mr. Harrison rode on an iron track himself near Philadelphia thirty years ago.  But even iron was dear then and steel is getting cheaper and cheaper every year now with the vastly improved methods of its production.  The track to be at the exposition will be many times cheaper than the iron road ridden over by Mr. Harrison three decades ago.</p>

                            <p>Much to their regret the exposition officials have been compelled to give up the plan to secure the presence of the two living ex-presidents during the Peace Jubilee.  Both Mr. Harrison and Mr. Cleveland will be detained by business and neither will be able to participate in the crowning feature of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Miller wired President Wattles yesterday that he had just received a telegram from Mr. Cleveland at Buzzard's Bay in which the ex-president stated that, while he should like to receive the committee, he owed it to the members to advise them in advance that he could not possibly accept their invitation.  A letter from Dr. Miller also conveyed the information that he had called on ex-President Harrison at his cottage in the Adirondacks and received the same answer that Mr. Harrison had given to a delegation from Chicago, which was a positive refusal of the invitation.</p>
                            <p>John C. Wharton, who went on to New York, writes that everything is working satisfactorily at that end of the line.  He has seen Chauncey M. Depew, Senator Hanna and other notables and all have evinced a disposition to co-operate in making the Jubilee a success.  He states that he has been assured that a rate of $18 for the round trip will be made to Chicago and return, and with this concession he expects a considerable attendance from the extreme east.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Shows the Way for the Exhibitors of Fruit at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>While it was no special occasion, it was Douglas county day just the same at the Horticultural building yesterday.  The county exhibit has been kept in perfect shape since the opening of the exposition, but a couple of days ago Superintendent Walker concluded that he would make something of a spread yesterday, so he piled on the fruit until he had his tables groaning under the load.</p>
                            <p>Douglas county has always been recognized as a good location for fruit raising, but yesterday it set at rest all possibilities that might have arisen to convince people to the contrary.  Thirty varieties of grapes, twenty-nine of plums, thirty-eight of apples and seventeen of peaches, with a dozen of pears, were displayed.  The fruit was all fresh and clean and attracted a great deal of attention among the visitors to the building, many of whom mistook it for the entire exhibit of some state.</p>
                            <p>The season does not seem to make any difference with the display of fruit made by Nebraska, and summer fruits are being shown right alongside of the fall and winter varieties.  For instance, apples and plums, that went out of market a month ago, and they are in as good condition as when picked.  Speaking of this remarkable fact, Superintendent Youngers said:  "Much of it is due to the fruit and a good deal is due to the soil.  Our fruit is the best in the world, and again, the soil contains properties that cause the fruit to stand up and not decay.  There is fruit that if raised in some of the other states will rot and have to go off the tables inside of two days.  Raise the same fruit here after it has been properly acclimated and it will stand up for weeks.  Instead of rotting it will simply wither.  This is not due to the atmosphere, for our fruit and that of other states is exposed to the same atmosphere in this building and that while that shown by other exhibitors has gone to the garbage heap ours is in a fair condition.  This is why we can show cherries that were out of market nearly two months ago."</p>
                            <p>Yesterday the men in charge of the Nebraska fruit exhibit changed the peach tables, putting on fifty bushels of the fruit.  At the same time they renewed the grape exhibit, placing seventy-five baskets upon the tables.  The Nebraska peaches are rapidly becoming the favorites in the Horticultural building.  Some weeks ago, when Peach day was observed some of the exhibitors made fun of the fruit, saying that the peaches were green as grass and hard as rocks.  Since that time they have changed their tunes.  The fruit has ripened and now all who scoffed a few days ago are willing to admit that the peaches grown in this state have as fine flavor as any in the world.  With apples it is the same story and while it is conceded that the crop is short this season the exhibit is about equal to any in the building.  The exhibit is large and the quality of the fruit excellent.  Some of the apples are specked, but this is a thing that is general with about all of the apples shown, there being but one or two exceptions to this rule.  When it comes to grapes all of the other states take a back seat, the people in charge admitting that the Nebraska exhibit cannot be beaten.</p>
                            <p>Superintendents Lane and Fravert, in charge of the Colorado fruit exhibit, have received a letter from Senator Swink, one of the principal fruit growers of Colorado and a man prominent in horticultural interests.  He says that he regrets exceedingly that the Colorado exhibit has been compelled to suffer on account of the failure to receive a supply with which to replenish it.  He adds that during the last week he has seen a large number of the prominent fruit growers of the state and that they have promised to take the matter up and send on fresh stuff regularly.</p>

                            <p>The famous Innes band of New York will make its initial appearance at the exposition in two concerts Sunday afternoon and evening.  In the opinions of many critics this organizations has no superior in its peculiar line and the local music lovers are anticipating its arrival with more than ordinary pleasure.  The band includes fifty pieces and is in every respect a high class organization.  At Nashville it commanded popular favor to a remarkable degree, and it has appeared in connection with many of the most important musical events in the east.  Mr. Innes is himself a composer of no ordinary ability, and his compositions have been compared very favorably with those of John Philip Sousa.</p>
                            <p>The Sunday afternoon concert will begin at 3:30 o'clock and will be of a sacred character.  The exposition chorus will participate to the extent of singing "America" as the finale of the opening overture and the rendition of the hallelujah chorus from the "Messiah."  The band numbers present an exceptionally choice selection of popular and classic numbers, including two of Mr. Innes' compositions.  The evening concert will be give on the Plaza, and the program is the most attractive that has ever been attempted by a band in Omaha.  A good portion of the music will be new to exposition audiences, and it also includes a number of selections that have generally been considered as the exclusive province of an orchestra.</p>

They are hard at work manufacturing brick for their adobe house that will be erected at some point west of the Sacs and Foxes.  These Indians are small, but this does not decrease their capacity to put in full time.  Every morning they are up with the sun and work right through until the whistles blow for noon.  At 1 o'clock they are out and at work again, continuing until the sun goes down.  Up to date they have made about 1,000 brick and will require about twice as many more in the construction of their house.</p>
                            <p>In manufacturing their adobe brick the Pueblos dig a hole in the ground, taking off the top soil.  When they reach the clay subsoil they turn in water and mix the earth to the desired consistency.  After this the brick are put in moulds, carried to a level spot and there dumped to dry in the sun.  The brick are eighteen inches long, three inches thick and twelve inches wide.</p>
                            <p>The straw house that will be occupied by the Wichitas is about completed and ready for occupancy.  It is located in the extreme northeast corner of the grounds and is daily frequented by hundred of visitors.  Most of the work in the construction of the structure was performed by the women, an Indian, Towanka Jim, bossing the job.  To do this bossing he sits on a pile of hay near by and devotes most of his time to telling the women how to perform the work.</p>
                            <p>In the construction of the house four upright poles are set about six feet apart.  On top are cross pieces, which assist in supporting the roof.  From the apex poles are set at an angle of about forty-five degrees.  These poles are some eighteen inches apart at the base and close together at the top.  Over them is placed hay in layers, forming a thatch, which is bound down and which sheds the water.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Members to Be Given a Taste of Their Native Delicacy.</head>
                            <p>A little farewell banquet will be tendered the members of the Mexican band at 4 o'clock this afternoon.  It will not be a very elaborate spread, but it will be a hot one.  On the menu cards there will be but hot tamales, made according to the most approved Mexican style.  The banquet will be served in the Agricultural building after the afternoon concert and will be in the space occupied by the Nebraska exhibit.  The tamales will be made by Mrs. MacMurphy.  Nebraska will furnish the cornmeal and meat, while Texas, through Prof. Attwater, will supply the peppers and all of the other ingredients that make the real tamale a fiery article to do business with.</p>
                            <p>An invitation was extended to the band yesterday to attend the little banquet and all of the members promptly accepted, several of them saying that they are anxious to have a taste of the national dish, as it is prepared in the United States.  The meal for making the tamales will be ground just before the tamales are cooked and while the grinding is in progress several speeches will be made and it is more than likely that the health of President McKinley and President Diaz will be drunk in cold water.  At least that is in the program.  Prof. Attwater of Texas will deliver a short address, telling of life along the Mexican border.</p>

                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee, held yesterday afternoon, judges at the live stock show were appointed as follows:</p>

                            <p>An excursion from Shelbyville, Ill., has been organized for Peace Jubilee week and the promoters expect to bring a party of at least 300 from that city.  A low rate has been secured and the tickets will be good for twenty-one days.</p>
                            <p>Special Agent McGarvie writes from St. Paul that the St. Paul road has made a flat rate of $9 from St. Paul and Minneapolis for Twin City day, which occurs October 8.  This is less than half fare and the prospect for a number of big excursions from those cities is encouraging.</p>
                            <p>Among yesterday's visitors was Corporal Van Horn of the Sixteenth infantry, a son of Major Van Horn of the Twenty-second.  To Corporal Van Horn belongs the honor of planting the first American flag on the blockhouse at San Juan.  He was in the thick of the fight and dashed forward and unfurled the flag from the fortification in the face of a fire that seemed to offer no possible chance of accomplishing the feat.</p>
                            <p>Miss Neil Barber, who has been register clerk at the Iowa building since its opening, has returned to her home at Oakland.  She will be succeeded by Mrs. Thompson of Davenport, who will preside over the big book until the close of the exposition.  Originally it was the intention to have a new register clerk each month, but the work of Miss Barber was so satisfactory that she was kept three months and until after the big rush on Iowa day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sioux City, Lincoln, Hastings, St. Joseph and Other Commercial Centers Send Bodies of Hustlers to Help Celebrate.</head>
                            <p>Traveling men poured into the city this morning on every train to participate in the celebration of their day at the exposition.  The first delegation to arrive was from Sioux City, at 9:10, numbering in 100 in all.  They came with Prof. Reed's Sioux City band of twenty-one pieces and were escorted from the Webster Street depot to the Transmississippi Traveling Men's club by a committee composed of members of the United Commercial Travelers, the Travelers' Protective association and the Western Travelers' Accident association.  At 9:45 the Lincoln drummers came in, 100 strong, at the B. &amp; M. depot.  The Hastings men arrived at 11:40 with about the same number and Grand Island sent fifty who joined the rest at the local headquarters at 1 o'clock this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Besides those who came in on the trains this morning, all the local knights of the grip are putting forth their best efforts to make the day a success.  The crowd that gathered at the Transmississippi club at 1 o'clock numbered 600.  Special trolley cars had been engaged to convey them to the grounds, where they were met by the Mexican band and escorted through the main buildings and up and down the Midway.</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Traveling Men's club threw open its doors last evening to the members of the Western Travelers' Accident association and all other knights of the grip who have come to the city to attend Traveling Men's day at the exposition today.  One hundred drummers and their ladies filled the club house and veranda.  The men had come from wanderings in many states and told stories galore of their experiences on the road.  The punch bowl, stationed in the card room, was an attractive feature of the evening, rivaled only by the cigars that were distributed freely and without stint.</p>
                            <p>The committees in charge of Traveling Men's day are:  General committee&#8212;E. S. Streeter, W. H. Butts and C. C. Patrick.  Reception committee&#8212;E. W. Getten, H.

                            <p>Kansas City railroad men are represented at the exposition today in goodly number.  The passenger agents of that city came up on a special car and will remain until tomorrow evening.  They have a folder announcing the event, and the frontispiece is a representation of a passenger agent making good time through the Midway and touching only the high places.

                            <head type="sub">THE EXPOSITION OF 1899.</head>
                            <p>There is now every assurance that the Trans-Mississippi exposition will be closed with a neat balance to its credit.  When we look back upon the difficulties that beset the inauguration of this great enterprise we may well marvel at the splendid manner in which every obstacle was surmounted.  One of the greatest difficulties encountered was the impression prevalent in all sections of the country that the enterprise could not be successful.  Not until recently, when the real magnitude of this great exposition had come to be appreciated, have the leading men in many of the western states realized that their states lost an opportunity in failing to be properly represented at this great demonstrator of western progress.</p>
                            <p>In spite of all obstacles and embarrassments, the great Trans-Mississippi exposition of 1898 has been a mighty success.  Opened at a time when this nation was engaged in a war with a foreign foe, it might have been expected that the success of the enterprise would be jeopardized.  But the highest expectations of those who appreciated all conditions have been realized.  It is not to be doubted, however, that during a period of national peace, with men of all sections thoroughly informed as to the magnitude of the exposition, that that enterprise would far excel in its results the record of 1898.  The World-Herald, therefore, believes that the exposition management should begin to seriously consider the advisability of opening the exposition in 1899.  There can be no doubt that every one who visited the exposition this year, and many who did not visit it, would attend next year.  States that were not represented this year because they had no confidence in the enterprise would be represented in 1899.</p>
                            <p>There is no reason to doubt that if the exposition management shall take hold of this suggestion the enterprise may be carried forward to 1899, and that the results would be greater even than those of the present year.</p>
                            <p>We have demonstrated to the world what Omaha and Nebraska can do in the way of a great exposition.  Many people refused to believe that the results obtained were possible of accomplishment.</p>
                            <p>We have "shown" them.</p>
                            <p>Now let us invite them to come to Omaha in 1899 and make the Trans-Mississippi exposition one of international interest.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Knowles of the United States life saving service exhibition announces that hereafter the exhibition will be given at 3 instead of 4 p. m.  The reason is that the days are getting shorter and the war balloon ascension and other afternoon features will be on the program next week, and an earlier hour for the life saving exhibit is desirable.</p>

                            <p>Live stock galore, the pick of the horses and cattle and sheep and swine of twenty states and Canada, 2,350 animals assured, with every dollar of the prize money already on deposit in the bank, subject to order, October 20, and these are a few of the reasons why the exposition doubts not that the coming live stock show, October 3 to 20, will be "the" live stock event of America this year.</p>
                            <p>For this show, one of the crowning events at the close of the exposition, there are being built fifty-one barns, with windows in the sides to illuminate by day, and electric lights by night; with a hydrant gushing pure water at every barn; with mangers and partitions substantially built; the whole arranged in compact form, convenient to exhibitors and spectators, as the experience of live stock shows has taught.</p>
                            <p>Capacious sheep and swine pavilions have been built, with pens in the center, and ample-covered floors for spectators.</p>
                            <p>There will be a finely-arranged show ring, with an amphitheater accommodating 3,000 people.</p>
                            <p>Although the show does not open till October 3, all barns, and everything in fact, will be completed and arranged for the reception of stock of all kinds on October 1.</p>
                            <p>Since the exposition paid all of its debts, or at least had the money to do it with over a week ago, and has a magnificent balance to its credit, with the best six weeks to come, the managers feel that they can afford a few luxuries, and are thus spared no expense to make the live stock show a model of shows and a big success.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday's crowd was not only remarkable for its size as a Saturday crowd, but more so for its noise and activity, for the live element including the traveling men, and what fun they didn't find was not of much consequence.  In gay procession at night, they marched from concession to concession, ending with the cake walk at the German Village at 11 o'clock last night.</p>
                            <p>Poor children from Lincoln, 800 of them, had a good time all day, and helped to swell the crowd.</p>
                            <p>Iowans and Modern Woodmen of America still remained in evidence, having as good a time as on their own days.</p>
                            <p>While the attendance is immense, the financial condition gives rise to greater congratulations.  To date, there is an indebtedness of $68,000, with a deposit in the bank of $113,000, a balance to the good of $45,000.  Such a condition six weeks before the close is a marvel among expositions.</p>

                            <p>More stuff for the signal corps arrived from the war department yesterday morning for Major Ward's exhibit.  There is a big new balloon, making three of the serviceable big fellows, two heliograph outfits and a large number of signal flags.  And then there is the big war balloon which was shot to pieces on the firing line at Santiago.  It has since been so neglected, being rolled up while wet, that it has nearly rotted.  By careful manipulation it is hoped to place it in a favorable position in the war department exhibit this morning.</p>
                            <p>From North Dakota has arrived a big collection of handsome red-cheeked Wealthy apples, large and perfectly formed.  To the ordinary visitor the idea of fine apples from North Dakota causes wonderment, but from Hankinson, in Richland county, it is asserted, can be gotten a dozen varieties of apples at any time.  From the Red river valley has recently arrived a bunch of alfalfa seven and a half feet in height, something that is causing visitors to pause a second time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. T. W. Shepard, electrician for the Innes band, arrived in the city last week to make arrangements for receiving the band today, and for the big concert at the Auditorium at 3:30 this afternoon.  Innes deals much with the spectacular, and in doing so electricity is the agent used in the flaming anvils in the anvil chorus, and with the rapid fire guns used in other selections.</p>
                            <p>Last evening the executive committee authorized the purchase of fireworks for special displays the coming Wednesday night, Swedish-American day; Saturday night, Chicago day; Friday, Children's and Old Settlers' day, day and night pyrotechnics; Wednesday night, October 5, Ohio and Pennsylvania days; Saturday night, October 8, Twin City day.</p>

                           <head type="sub">Brilliant Program of Music and Fireworks&#8212;Band's Farewell.</head>
                            <p>Richest and best of all the numbers for six weeks, with which the Mexican band has delighted exposition audiences, were chosen last evening for the farewell concert of the popular band from the land of the Montezumas, as arranged by Mr. Thomas J. Kelly.  There were "La Paloma," "Travatore Fantasia," with trombone solo; "Lucia de Lamermoor," with fantasia; "The Bird Vender," with piccolo solo; "The Forge in the Forest," with bird calls, anvils, etc.; the Mexican national hymn; an American fantasia; again the catchy "La Paloma," with a grand finale of waving banners, red fire, pyrotechnics filling the sky above the audience with showers of radiant stars and molten fire and cheers by the audience.  To the brilliant program had been added a portion of the Spanish-American fantasia so enthusiastically received the evening before.</p>
                            <p>As the crimson light was dying out and the mimic galaxy of stars and golden rain had fallen, Major Clarkson proposed three cheers for the Mexican band, which were heartily given.  In the enthusiasm of the moment the short, portly and demonstrative chief musician, Captain Ricardo Pacheco, embraced Major Clarkson, as a returned brother reported dead at Santiago, and the crowd again cheered as he embraced and wept the more.  Then the Mexicans cheered the United States, the exposition and several other things, and in a tumult of enthusiasm the crowd separated.</p>

                            <p>"Le Roi est Mort!  Vive le Roi!"</p>
                            <p>Exit the Mexican band.  Enter the Innes band.</p>
                            <p>For six weeks the musical people who have visited the exposition have had a treat.  The concerts which have been given by the Mexican band have elicited the hearty applause and sincere commendation of all who are interested in the better class of musical compositions.  The band, governed as it is under the strict laws of military discipline, is obliged to attend regular daily rehearsal, whether the members may need it or not.  With the careful guidance of the highly educated maestro, Ricardo Pacheco, these rehearsals are used for the production of a repertory which would seem to be endless.  Captain Pacheco is a thorough musician, well versed in the music of all schools.  He conducts with equal ease and interprets with absolute accuracy.  The suite "Scenes Pittoresques" of Massanet, the "Pagliacci" prologue of Leoncavallo, and the "Tannhauser" overture of Richard Wagner, thereby showing a great fund of musical knowledge, playing such widely different compositions, each a supreme masterpiece of one of the three great modern schools.</p>
                            <p>The band is composed of forty musicians who lead an ideal existence.  It is quite a common mistake to suppose these Mexican soldiers have a very hard time, but from information obtained from the most reliable source it appears that they are treated with great consideration and they thoroughly enjoy life.  It is truly wonderful to see them play some of the standard operatic fantasies.  The emotion that is displayed, in such materialistic instruments as the cornet, trombone, and even the kettle drums when in the hands of their respective owners and masters, is astonishing.  On Wednesday night last "Trovatore" was played.  The tones which emanated from the trombone in playing the "Prison Scene" were beautiful, velvety, and more like the rich diapason of an old mellow organ.  The trombone soloist is the sergeant of the band.  The piccolo soloist is also a wonder on his instrument.</p>
                            <p>The band has made a magnificent impression upon the visitors of the exposition and especially upon all those who are interested in music of the high grade, and it is with feelings of great regret that the word goodbye is said.  The peculiar uniforms, with the nodding plume, the tasseled chevron and the mysterious little black bag, have gone.  "La Paloma" will doubtless be played here again by other bands, but it will never be the "La Paloma" of the last six weeks.  The "Golondrina" played by any other band will be lacking in its own intensity.  The gallant captain, with his fascinating bow, his magnetic charm in conducting and his cap, always a little to one side of his head, will no longer grace the beautiful structure which stands on the Grand Plaza, a monument dedicated to art.</p>
                            <p>And so, the Mexican band has gone and once more Mexico will be bright with music, and for us&#8212;as far as the Mexican band is concerned&#8212;"Darkness again and a silence."</p>
                            
                            <p>But while the Mexican band leaves, Innes, the great bandmaster of New York, arrives and will give his opening concert today at 3:30 p. m.  Mr. Innes is a man of strong personality, very magnetic and very commanding.  He is a fine musician and an excellent conductor, making his personality felt by all those who come in contact with him.  He plays programs of the very best order.  He knows how to catch the people and will be fully as popular as Sousa would be.  He has with him some very fine solo instrumentalists and Mr. Innes himself is a celebrated trombone soloist, in fact, he made his debut in the musical world with that instrument.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Choral congress, which was to have been held in connection with the exposition at this very time, had to be abandoned for three reasons.  First, the fact that advantageous railroad rates could not be secured.  Second, because a great many people who had decided to come changed their plans when they heard of the Peace Jubilee, and the fact that the president of the United States was to be here.  Third, the discouraging apathy which seems to exist when any educational musical feature is attempted.  The exposition management has already shown that it is willing to do anything to advance the cause of art by sinking many thousands of dollars in concert work.  It is urged now that this is the time to give concerts.  That the people will go to them now, but any one who is a judge of human nature and 
                            <note type="handwritten">Continuation of "Music"</note>
                            who is at all interested in watching the crowds will find out with certainty that it is impossible to get an audience to stay quiet in one place for an hour or an hour and a half in any entertainment.  Even the band concerts have a fluctuating audience.  The Auditorium, during the organ recitals, holds an audience of about 800 from start to finish, but that 800 changes its identity after every number.  The people are restless, they are on the move to see all they can in as short a time as possible.  Therefore they will go in and hear one number of a concert merely to be able to go back home and say they have heard such and such a one play or sing.  The exposition crowds are not seriously disposed.  They are out for a good time and they don't want education.</p>
                            <p>And speaking along this line, a great many Omaha musicians have complained bitterly because they have not received engagements, because the management does not run a series of symphony concerts and song recitals for the benefit of a few artists and an audience of about 150 people, and yet singers who are known to donate their service to many events of minor importance that take place in Omaha have attached to their service for the exposition a price which they were never known <choice><sic>ho</sic><corr>to</corr></choice> have received before.</p>

                            <p>If there is virtue in the idea that nothing succeeds like success the remaining weeks of the Transmississippi Exposition should be marked by a prosperity unprecedented in the history of expositions.  At the end of sixteen weeks and four days of actual operation the enterprise has attained a degree of financial success that has not been approximated by any previous exposition in this country.  If its gates were closed today it has money in the bank to pay every dollar of indebtedness and dispense a handsome dividend to the stockholders.  According to the books of Secretary Wakefield, the present indebtedness of the exposition is $68,000, which stands against a cash balance in the bank of $113,000, exclusive of the receipts of yesterday.  For some time past all bills have been paid whenever presented with the proper vouchers and the cash surplus has steadily accumulated.</p>
                            <p>The present indebtedness consists almost exclusively of balances due on contracts and the operating expenses for September.  The first aggregates $26,000 and the latter $48,000 at the maximum cost of $2,000 a day.  Of this latter amount $8,000 has already been taken up on account of weekly pay rolls and the total obligation on account of operating expenses is $40,000.  Notes aggregating $2,000 are outstanding, making a total indebtedness of $68,000.</p>
                            <p>The balance in the bank yesterday morning was $113,000.  When yesterday's receipts are deposited the amount will exceed $120,000, or more than $50,000 above the liabilities.  This statement is of peculiar interest at this time on account of an alleged effort on the part of persons interested in the St. Louis stock show to disseminate the insinuation that this exposition will not be able to pay its stock premiums.  The cost of the stock show is comprised in two items.  The management has offered $35,000 in premiums and the buildings, which are now in course of construction, will cost slightly less than $20,000.  Of the aggregate $55,000, bills amounting to $11,000 have already been paid and the bulk of the remainder will not be due until nearly the end of October.  But if every dollar of the entire amount was due tomorrow the exposition has the money in the bank to pay it and still have a handsome balance left in the treasury.  Over 1,500,000 people have visited the exposition during the summer and the total receipts to date have been nearly $700,000.</p>

                            <p>The most prosperous week that the big show has yet enjoyed just ended yesterday with one of the best Saturday crowds of the season.  The total attendance for the week was nearly 200,000, as compared with a previous high water mark of 135,213, which was registered during the week which ended September 3.  Yesterday's crowd was augmented by the attendance of about 1,000 transmississippi traveling men, an excursion of Kansas City passenger and ticket agents and a part of 700 Lincoln school children.  With these remained several thousand of the visitors who had been on the grounds during the previous days and the usual patronage in the evening brought the aggregate to a very satisfactory figure.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="225" xml:id="TMISB06-225"/>
                            
                            <p>No merrier party has been on the grounds than the train load of children that came from Lincoln yesterday morning.  These were little ones whose parents could not afford to send them with the previous excursions.  They had been compelled to stand on the street corners and see their schoolmates whirled away to the big show and then listen to their stories of the wonderful things they had seen with the sorrowful conviction that they could never see these wonders for themselves.  But the practical philanthropy of D. E. Thompson of Lincoln gave them the opportunity that they had longed for and a happier crowd than these boys and girls appeared when they landed on the grounds would be hard to find.  Many of them were shabbily dressed, but they were all clean and radiant with happiness.  Each child was tagged with a big yellow badge and then they were turned out to luxuriate in the beauties of the exposition with all the enthusiasm of children to which everything they saw was a revelation.  There were over 700 children in the party and their unconcealed enjoyment of their holiday gave pleasure to everyone who observed them.</p>
                            <p>The traveling men did not arrive at the grounds until 2 o'clock, but they made up for lost time in their peculiar style.  There were 920 of them in the party, and they started on parade over the grounds, headed by the Fourth Regiment band of Sioux City.  But as they passed round the main court the attractions of the surrounding buildings proved too strong to be resisted and by the time the procession reached the Midway less than half of them remained in line.  Nearly all the concessions made them a reduced rate.  The visitors showed their appreciation by making the Midway the hottest street in town for the remainder of the day and evening, and the chink of the ice in the pitcher will be the sweetest music some of them every heard when they wake up this morning.</p>

Harrison, the commissioner for that state, to get up a big reunion on that date of all ex-residents of New Jersey now located in the transmississippi states.</p>
                            <p>It is planned to hold the reunion in the New York state building, which has been generously placed at the disposal of Mr. Harrison for that purpose and the program, to be uniquely appropriate, will begin at 10 a. m.  Mr. Harrison is an enthusiastic believer in state days.  He thinks they do more than any other one thing to bring people to see the great object lesson of the exposition.  He is now corresponding with a number of prominent New Jersey men, with a view to getting them out here to take part.  Anything that any ex-New Jerseyman would like to know pertaining to the reunion plans can be learned by communicating with Mr. Harrison at the Administration building.</p>

Thursday was especially notable as the biggest day by over 8,000 since the exposition opened.  This is the record of the week, as compared with the corresponding days of the preceding week:</p>

                            <head type="sub">Captain Leeson Makes Plans to Install a Territorial Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>Captain Leeson, the exposition commissioner from New Mexico, returned yesterday from his home, where he went two weeks ago for the purpose of arranging to secure exhibits for a fruit display.  He succeeded, and early next month will have two carloads of the horticultural and agricultural products from New Mexico on exhibition.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of New Mexico's purpose in making a display, Captain Leeson said:  "While of course we have some selfish motives, we are anxious to do all that we can to help the exposition along.  The great show is pretty thoroughly advertised in the section of country where I reside and if the railroads will concede a point and put in a fair rate many of our people will be here next month.  What we want is a New Mexico day.  It ought to be some time between October 1 and 10.  If it was about October 10 I feel satisfied that hundreds of our people would come for the purpose of participating in the Jubilee week exercises and also showing the world that we are on earth.</p>
                            <p>"While absent I arranged to have a fine horticultural and agricultural exhibit sent on, but it will not reach here until about October 5.  Our territorial fair is held during the latter part of September, and as soon as it is over we will ship the great portion of the fruit and vegetables to Omaha for exhibition, keeping everything on the tables until the close of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"I had wanted to make our exhibit in the Horticultural building, that our products might be compared with those from the states, but as all of the space in that building is occupied, I have had to look elsewhere.  I have seen Commissioner Field of the Minnesota commission and have arranged with him for space in the Minnesota state building.  I will place tables on the first floor of that structure and will make our exhibit there.  There may be some things that we cannot get at the state fair, but if there are any we will have them.  While I was at home I visited scores of fruit growers and induced them to send on their products, insisting that everything reach here in time to be shown with our general exhibit.  In this way I think that we will make a very creditable exhibit, notwithstanding the fact that we will be late in getting around."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Handshaking Congress During Jubilee Week is Warmly Endorsed.</head>
                            <p>The North and South Hand Shaking feature of Jubilee week, October 10-15, is being boomed throughout the south and letters received from different sections indicate that a large crowd of people will be in attendance.  The matter of working up enthusiasm in the southern states has been left largely in the hands of George F. Lupton, assistant general passenger agent of the San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass Railway company.  He has written to President Wattles and General Manager Clarkson of the exposition and informs them that the plan is very popular all through the south and that the people are pleased with the idea.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lupton says in his letter that he has enlisted the support of Congressman Slayden and numerous other prominent citizens of Texas, all of whom are booming the Jubilee week and especially Hand Shaking day, October 11, which is also Governors' day at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Upon the suggestion of Mr. Lupton the following prominent gentlemen of the south have been invited to be present and participate in the exercises of the Jubilee occasion, several of whom will be expected to address audiences upon the grounds:  Hon. Joseph B. Sayers, Hon. John H. Reagan, who is the only surviving member of the cabinet of Jefferson Davis; ex-Governor Lubbock, who was war governor of Texas; ex-Governor Hubbard, Hon. J. C. Hutchinson, Hon. W. T. Lanham, Hon. James L. Slayden, all of Texas; Congressmen Morgan, Stallings, Underwood and General Joseph Wheeler of Alabama; Congressmen Clay, Fleming, Brantley, ex-Governor Northen, Hon. John Temple Graves and General Gordon of Georgia; Congressmen Money, Allen, Williams and Henry of Mississippi; Congressmen Faulkner, Colonel White and Hon. Samuel L. Flourney of West Virginia; Congressmen Handy, Daniel, Tucker, Hay and Hon. Holmes Conrad and Judge Duke of Virginia; Congressman Rhea, Hon. Charles Bronson and ex-Governor Knott of Kentucky; Congressman Cooper, Hon. Bob Taylor and James R. Chalmers of Tennessee; Congressman Butler of North Carolina, Congressman McLaurin of South Carolina, Hon. George K. Favrot and Lionel Adams of Louisiana.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Nebraska Stands Treat Again, This Time to the Lincoln Children.</head>
                            <p>The Horticultural building had hundreds of youthful visitors yesterday.  The children who came up from Lincoln were let off the street cars at the entrance in the rear of the Georgia state building, and naturally the first building that they visited was the one where the fruit was shown.  Nebraska treated the youngsters right royally and upon leaving the building each child was given apples, peaches or grapes for lunch.  The little ones voted Nebraska a capital host.</p>
                            <p>Large additions were made to the Nebraska horticultural exhibit yesterday, notwithstanding the fact that it was Saturday and an off day.  The tables were full of the finest varieties, but they were not full enough to suit <choice><sic>Suuperintendent</sic><corr>Superintendent</corr></choice> Youngers and consequently more stuff was piled on.  When the work was completed there was as fine an exhibit as was ever seen at the exposition.  In addition to the regular exhibit, there were German prunes, yellow, German, Lombard and black German plums.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Hatch of the Wisconsin horticultural exhibit is in high feather for the simple reason that he feels that he has all of the transmississippi states whipped to a finish on the apple show.  He has 100 varieties of apples on his tables, and takes great pleasure in explaining that this is more than double the number shown by any other exhibitor.  The Wisconsin apples are considered to be about the finest in the building, but just why this is no one can say.  In all of the states outside of the irrigated districts the apples are specked and off in shape and size, while those from Wisconsin seem to be perfect in every respect.  In addition to apples, Superintendent Hatch is showing a fine collection of plums, crab apples and pears.</p>
                            <p>Superintendents Lane and Fravert, in charge of the Colorado fruit exhibits, are feeling in better spirits than they were a few days ago.  Yesterday they received word from their homes to the effect that the fruit raisers are waking up to the importance of the exposition and are preparing to send on fruit in large quantities.  A small consignment was received yesterday, but not enough to replenish the tables.  More, though, is expected this week, when the exhibits made by the several counties will be put in first-class shape.</p>
                            <p>The Oregon exhibit, looked after by Superintendent Courtney, has received a small shipment of fruit, but not enough to put it in first-class condition.  That that came in yesterday was distributed around and again the exhibit presents a presentable appearance.</p>
                            <p>Kansas is getting to the front just now and is sending in apples in large quantities.  Early in the season it was reported that the crop was going to be short, but the indications now are that it will be fair and that all of the late fruit will be up to the average in quality.</p>

                            <p>Minnesota won out again in the butter scoring contest that was finished yesterday, being ahead in creamery.  The prize butter was from the Young America creamery at Young America.  The score was 99 per cent out of a possible 100.  The Wahoo creamery of Nebraska was close up at the top, its score being 97¾ per cent.  The judge found that it was slightly off in color, but in all other respects it was pronounced superior to the Minnesota butter.</p>
                            <p>In the contest on dairy butter Mrs. C. H. Robbins of St. Charles, Minn., and R. P. Foss of Corley, Ia., tied on 94 per cent.</p>
                            <p>The contest yesterday was the third since the opening of the exposition.  Iowa won the first and Minnesota the second and third.  The fourth and last contest will be held about the middle of October.  The butter that was in yesterday's scoring aggregated 3,729 pounds and was sold to a local dealer, who took the whole lot at 20 cents per pound.</p>

                            <p>Next Wednesday is Swedish-American day at the exposition, when the Swedes will come to the "White City" from all parts of the transmississippi region, as well as from the country east of the Mississippi, especially from Illinois.  Extensive preparations have been made by the local management to give the guests a worthy reception and entertain them while in our city.  The principal feature of the day will be a program of a high order, in which some of the foremost Swedish-Americans in the land will participate.  In the evening a grand banquet will be given at Markel's, on the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <p>The inflation of the war balloon was begun yesterday afternoon under the direction of Captain Yancey of the United States signal service.

                            be used twice a day.  This makes the aggregate capacity 16,000 feet a day, and as the big balloon holds 21,000 cubic feet it will require all of today to complete the job.  The hour of ascension will be announced today.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sioux Chief Would Like to Come Off Victor Once in Awhile.</head>
                            <p>During the sham battle at the Indian village yesterday afternoon Goes-to-War led the Sioux in their attack upon the allied forces under Big Brave and he was licked, just as he has been upon numerous occasions.  For about the sixteenth time Mr. Grass, a Standing Rock Sioux, allowed himself to be tortured at the stake, just in order to have the play go on.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday, after the fighting was all over, Mr. Goes-to-War told some of his intimate friends that he is tired of this continual drubbing at the hands of the Blackfeet and that unless there is a change in the program he will put in an extra number himself.</p>
                            <p>The battle yesterday started in the same old way.  Grass had been out hunting and somehow was captured.  Then he was conducted out onto the parade ground, where in full view of 10,000 spectators he was tied up to an electric light pole that had a bunch of boughs nailed to the top to give it the appearance of being a tree.  After he had been tied a slow fire was started in some straw that had been lying away loose and while the fire licked away at Grass' feet the other Indians howled and threw dust in his face.  Then there was the attack by the Sioux, the rescue and the hot fight that followed, during which the Blackfeet and their allies were driven away, leaving numerous dead and wounded Indians behind, Grass being one of them.  Then there was the rally and the attack upon the Blackfeet, who were some more Sioux, to the great amusement of the spectators.</p>
                            <p>The whole thing was in fun and while none of the Indians were hurt they exploded a lot of ammunition and got considerable amusement out of the proceedings.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FAREWELL TO THE MEXICAN BAND.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Popular Ovation Follows the Playing of Its Final Numbers.</head>
                            <p>The farewell concert of the Mexican band was heard by an immense audience on the Plaza last night and Captain Ricardo Pacheco and his musicians were given an enthusiastic ovation on their last appearance before an exposition audience.  The band has not been heard to better advantage during its six weeks' engagement than on this occasion.  The members have been much pleased with their reception in Omaha and they fairly outdid themselves in the effort to leave behind them as happy a recollection as they will carry away.  The program was especially selected for the last night and included a number of the compositions that have been most popular during the engagement.  Among the selections were the "Trovatore" fantasie, with trombone solo; "The Bird Vender," with piccolo solo; the fantasie "Lucia di Lammermoor" and the Mexican dance, "La Paloma," that has so thoroughly caught the fancy of Omaha crowds.  "The Forge in the Forest," with bird imitations and anvil accompaniment, was another very pleasing number and nearly every selection was heartily encored.</p>
                            <p>Just before the final fantasie the band played the Mexican national hymn, which is seldom heard outside of Mexico.  It can only be played outside of the presence of President Diaz, except with his personal consent and on this account it was heard with more than ordinary interest.  The final number was a fantasie of American melodies, which ended with the "Star Spangled Banner."  As the familiar strain was lifted the large forty foot flag that has just been purchased by the exposition was dropped over the front of the band stand.  The crowd stood up and cheered and a short but brilliant display of fireworks behind the pavilion completed the inspiring effect.</p>
                            <p>As the music ceased and Captain Pacheco bowed his final farewell the audience rose again and greeted him with an ovation of cheers and waving of hats and handkerchiefs.  The enthusiasm continued for several minutes and until "La Paloma" was repeated and then the band was compelled to respond to a third encore.  Then General Manager Clarkson proposed three cheers for Captain Pacheco and his band and these were given with hearty unanimity.  The band responded with three cheers for Omaha and three more for the exposition and the musicians and audience <choice><sic>separted</sic><corr>departed</corr></choice> with mutual good wishes.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee yesterday a resolution was adopted by which the thanks of the exposition are extended to President Diaz of Mexico for the services of the Mexican band and the general interest that he has taken in the exposition.  The resolutions will be handsomely engrossed and forwarded to President Diaz this week.</p>

                            <p>There is no feature to make today notable except those which Nature lavishes in kindly profusion.  Experience has indicated that the people who come to the exposition Monday are particularly interested in the permanent attractions of the grounds and consequently it has been determined that Monday celebrations are entirely unnecessary and undesirable.  The substantial increase in the Sunday attendance encourages the expectation of another prosperous week and this is supported by the large number of new faces that are in sight today.  The attendance this morning largely represented the van guard of the excursionists who will come in larger numbers tomorrow and Wednesday.  The street cars were loaded with people who carried grips and handbags and had evidently come to spend the week in Omaha.  Most of them made their way to the grounds during the day and with the twenty-five cent admission tonight there is every promise that yesterday's improvement will continue.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Good Crowds on Sunday.</head>
                            <p>Nebraska's beautiful Indian summer made the grounds a delightful resort yesterday, and although the crowd did not compare with those of secular occasions, it was decidedly above the Sunday average.  The first concerts of Innes' band were enjoyed by the biggest Sunday audiences that have been seen since the exposition opened, but aside from these there was nothing to make the day notable.  There were comparatively few people to be seen in the main court, but in the shadier portions of the enclosure there was as much animation as was consistent with the character of the day.  A large proportion of the visitors were strangers who had found the week insufficient in which to see all the beauties of the show and remained reluctant to leave them behind.  In the evening the crowd was considerably increased by local arrivals and some who had preferred to spend the earlier part of the day in other directions.</p>
                            <p>The extraordinary success of last week encourages the exposition management to look for a marked additional prosperity during the current week.  While it is possible that the big record of Modern Woodmen day may not be broken, the general average promises to be very high.  Aside from the tremendous general patronage that seems to be constantly increasing, the card for the week carries a number of attractions and special features that will add interest to the enterprise.  Today is without noteworthy feature aside from the initial ascension of the war balloon, but Tuesday will be Nebraska Millers' and Manufacturers' day and several hundred Nebraska merchants and manufacturers will visit the show.  The day has been worked up by Secretary Holmes of the Manufacturers' and Consumers' association and a very general interest has been taken in the event throughout the state.</p>

                            <p>In the lost and found bureau of the exposition guards' building is now awaiting a large vacancy for the return of a black silk lace shawl bought thirty years ago in England for £100 and highly treasured ever since.  It was worn to the Innes sacred concert yesterday afternoon at the Auditorium, and in the intense excitement at the conclusion, the elderly lady owning and wearing the precious keepsake permitted it to slip from her arm as she moved toward the door.  In a moment it was missed, and she returned to find the shawl, but it was gone.  The lady declined to give her name to the guards, as she feared that her husband and son would find out the loss, and she wouldn't have them know it for anything in the world.</p>
                            <p>In the lost and found department are awaiting the owners of nearly 100 umbrellas, from the gold-handled silk prizes down to the brown cotton family size, with a left rib broken, and the floating ones misplaced.  There are half a peck of purses, with from a dime to $5 in change in each, a collection of baby cloaks and wraps to supply a nursery, with gloves, handkerchiefs and souvenir purchases galore.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Washington and British Columbia Show Their Underground Wealth at Exposition.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commercial Rather Than Specimen Displays of Gold, Silver, Lead and Copper Ores.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Special and Interesting Features of the Exhibits--Samples From Mine Being Developed by Omaha Capital.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>To the miner, investor or prospective inventor the exhibits of the state of Washington and British Columbia, located in the northwest corner of the Mines and Mining building, are among the most interesting at the whole exposition, and ones to which any person interested in such matters from either a business <choice><sic>of</sic><corr>or</corr></choice> scientific standpoint will return a number of times.</p>
                            <p>The Washington exhibit, which extends along both the west and north walls, has above it a large portrait of Washington, with eagle and flag above it, for a sign, while the stars and stripes and the union jack appear together above the exhibit of British Columbia.  Both exhibits are in charge of L. K. Armstrong, a thoroughly well posted gentleman on rocks, ores and minerals.</p>
                            <p>One pleasing feature of the two exhibits is that they are made up exclusively of commercial ores, taken from the different mines just as they run.  It is not a "specimen" exhibit in any way, although there are a number of very rich pieces of ore which, however, but fairly represent the properties from which they were taken.  The ores are classified on points of value&#8212;gold, silver, copper and lead.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GOLD ORES.</head>
                            <p>Washington is not a free gold producing state, the great amount of precipitation bringing the zone of <choice><sic>oxydization</sic><corr>oxidization</corr></choice> very close to the surface, so that base ores are frequently found on it.  The minerals are usually in combination with sulphides, making them "roasting" ores.  A notable exception to this rule is found in the Republic mine, in which the ore runs from $40 up to $800 per ton of absolutely free gold.  The ore shoot at one point is sixteen feet wide and 200 feet long, none of the ore running less than $200 per ton.  The greatest feature of this mine, however, is the extreme fineness of the gold.  It occurs in a milky white, finely granulated rock, and under even the strongest glass no gold can be seen in it.  The company has recently put in an electro-cyanide plant which is very successful, saving between 97 and 98 per cent of the gold, which is too fine to be saved successfully by the ordinary free gold milling process.  Exposition visitors, it may be incidentally said, will waste time inquiring for stock in the Republic mine as there is none of it on the market.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SOURCE OF SILVER.</head>
                            <p>The principal source of silver in Washington, of which the exhibit contains a great number of large pieces, is the argentiferous galena.  And, so far as Washington is concerned, it can be stated that notwithstanding the low price of silver as measured in gold the mines are not being worked for the lead.  It is true that in some mines the value of the lead is as great or greater than the value of the silver, but a large proportion of them run about 50 per cent lead and from sixty to seventy ounces in silver.  As examples of properties which do not run this way may be mentioned on one side the Bonanza mine, which runs 35 per cent lead, ten ounces in silver and 27 per cent iron, and the Eagle mine at Chewelah, which runs 5 to 60 per cent lead and from fifty to 500 ounces of silver.</p>
                            <p>The figures given above will sound big even to persons somewhat familiar with mining, and in fact they are big.  But in connection with them it must be remembered that the highest grade of argentiferous lead ore in the world is found in the Pacific northwest.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">STRANGE COPPER ORE.</head>
                            <p>The Washington copper ores, as shown in the exhibit, are very different from those of the Lake Superior region.  The later run under 3 per cent, but what there is of it is pure copper.  In Washington the copper is in the form of a sulphide and goes direct to the smelter from the mine.  One of the new copper mines, located about forty miles from Spokane, is shipping large quantities of ore which runs 25 per cent metallic copper by the carload just as it comes from the mine.</p>
                            <p>The mineral belt in Washington is in the form of a horseshoe, one heel being in the eastern part of the state and extending into Idaho, while the other heel is in the Cascade mountains, in the southwest part of the state.  In the north half of the state ores of copper usually carry gold.  In Bay State company's mine, as also the La Fleur mine, the gold value is nearly equal to that of the copper, and there are also small values in silver.</p>
                            <p>One fine sample of silver ore in the exhibit is from a mine in the <choice><sic>Huckelberry</sic><corr>Huckleberry</corr></choice> mountains, which carries from 200 to 1,100 ounces in silver and $10 in gold per ton.  The sample itself is worth $50 and is from a blanket vein two to four feet wide.  A carload a day is shipped from the mine, which is paying big dividends.  The ore is much in demand by the smelters, being silicious ore, of which very little is found in Washington.  The Black Hills and Washington in this respect might make a good trade so far as treatment of ore is concerned, the former having a very large proportion of silicious ores.</p>
                            <p>There are two other pieces of silver lead ore worthy of particular mention and it would take a $100 bill to cover the value in them.  One is from a body of ore <choice><sic>runinng</sic><corr>running</corr></choice> 60 per cent lead and 120 ounces in silver, and the other carries 75 per cent lead and 500 ounces in silver.  There are also two bars of silver, each worth $25, which are more valuable still as being the first made by a smelter in the state of Washington.</p>
                            <p>Among the rare minerals shown by Washington are samples of Freibergite, or argentiferous gray copper; molybdenite, the sulphite of molybdenum; native silver; ammoniacal silver.  There are also samples of bituminous coal, coke, iron ore, ornamental and polished stone, marble and slate, of which there is one slab two by six feet in size.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">BRITISH COLUMBIA.</head>
                            <p>In the exhibit of British Columbia, which is immediately east of that of Washington, and which is also in charge of L. K. Armstrong, there are five tons of ores characteristic of different districts in the province.  There are over 1,000 specimens, and connected with some of them are stories which if not well known as true, would be set down as the fairy tales of a dreamer.  There are, for example, samples from the Le Roi mine, the stock of which six years ago went begging at 5 cents a share, and it was with difficulty that the money was obtained at this price for stock with which to develop the property.  Since then the mine has paid $1,000,000 in dividends, besides paying $500,000 for development work and equipment, and building a $250,000 smelter.  The stock in place of selling for 5 cents a share is now held at $6 per share and the owners of it are not looking for purchasers even at that figure.  The present daily shipment from the Le Roi is from 300 to 400 tons.</p>
                            <p>There are also samples from the War Eagle, which recently sold for $600,000; from the Victoria, which was sold a few days ago for a large sum to a Spokane banker, and from other mines which have made their discoverers or purchasers wealthy.  The famous Carriboo mine, which was recently reorganized and is paying big dividends monthly, also is represented by a number of samples.</p>
                            <p>The latter mine&#8212;the Carriboo&#8212;is particularly interesting to Omaha visitors, as it is in the same district and adjoining the Lemon mine, now being developed by Omaha capital.  The Lemon mine and adjoining claims owned by the company have a fine exhibit, and one which for one peculiarity will hold the attention of a mining man.  It is an ideal vein to work, for in place of having to send it to a smelter, the values can easily be saved by a stamp mill and concentrators.  There is one piece of ore from the Lemon mine, development work on which is being pushed and which is rapidly nearing the producing stage, weighing over 100 pounds.  The ore is still increasing in value, as does that of the other mines in the district, as depth is attained, but it has already reached and passed the paying point.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the gold ores, one of the interesting features of the exhibit of British Columbia is a block of Crows Nest coal, from the 100-foot vein, to get to which a railroad was built.</p>

                            <p>A cloudless sky and a cool, refreshing breeze put the exposition at its best today and attracted a happy throng of visitors.  Never in its history has the White City been so beautiful.  Under the slanting rays of the September sun plaster becomes marble, and the buildings built for a day stood out against the clear blue sky like mosques of Omar.  They dazzled the eyes, but they reflected no longer the melting heat of July and August.</p>
                            <p>Today is Nebraska Millers' and Manufacturers' day.  They had prepared no program to announce their presence, but mingled with the crowds and enjoyed to the fullest extent the blessings of so perfect a day.  Several hundred came from all over the state.  They entered the grounds early and soon were lost.</p>
                            <p>There were no special features to the program this morning, excepting the concert by the Omaha Concert band, on the Plaza, at 10 o'clock.  This attracted a good many of the crowd, but most of them preferred to take advantage of the opportunities which the weather afforded to view the exhibits and the grounds.</p>
                            <p>A feature of this afternoon's program will be the ascension of the Santiago war balloon at 4 o'clock.  Yesterday's trial trip showed that the balloon will work successfully under favorable conditions of the wind and weather.  It is hoped that this afternoon the balloon may be let up the cable's length, which is 2,500 feet.  The method of communicating with the ground through the retaining cable will be shown.  The corps under Captain Yancey is not yet prepared to give an exhibition of heliograph signaling or the wig-wag of flags, but it is expected that these will be shown the last of the week.</p>
                            <p>Innes' New York band, which has proved so popular, gives concerts this afternoon at 2 o'clock in the Auditorium and at 7 o'clock this evening at the Government building.  At 5 o'clock this afternoon the Omaha Concert band gives a selected program at the Government building.</p>
                            <p>Tomorrow is Swedish-American day.  It is expected that a large delegation will come from eastern points to swell the crowds.  A program has been prepared for the afternoon and evening.</p>

                            <p>The sham battle, which was announced for today, has been postponed.  The Indians are giving their attention to another exhibition which will probably be performed Saturday, <choice><sic>differingwidely</sic><corr>differing widely</corr></choice> from the sham battles that have interested the people so greatly during the last two weeks.</p>
                            <p>There is every indication that Friday, which is Children's day, will see a host of little ones on the grounds.  W. K. Fowler, superintendent of schools at Blair, will bring a special train carrying 1,000 children from that place.  Those who would otherwise have been unable to come have been provided for by liberal subscriptions by the citizens of Blair.  The management has decided that on that day and on October 15, which will also be given over to the youngsters, the admission shall be 15 cents for children between the ages <choice><sic>of5</sic><corr>of 5</corr></choice> and 15 years.  Another movement having the pleasure of the little ones in view has been started by the Home Fire Insurance company of this city.  The company has proposed to make arrangements that will allow the poor children to see the exposition free.  It will raise enough money by subscription to pay the expenses, see to its assembling of the children, pay their <choice><sic>stret</sic><corr>street</corr></choice> car fare, give them admission to the grounds and provide them with lunches while there.  The executive committee has approved of the proposal and has made the price of admission 10 cents.  The board has set October 8 as the date for the outing of the poor children of Omaha.  It is expected that at least 700 will be given one day of pleasure and sight-seeing.</p>
                            <p>The residents of Topeka have asked for Thursday, October 5, for Topeka day.  This date will mark the close of the carnival which will be held in that city during the preceding week, and it is expected that of the number who attend the celebration many will continue the festivity by attending the exposition.</p>

In addition to the members of the cabinet who have previously announced their intention to be present Secretary Long has consented to accompany the president and he will be one of the speakers of the occasion.  A very satisfactory representation of the naval and military heroes of the war is already assured and others will probably decided to come during the next two weeks.  General William R. Shafter will also be here during the week.  Dr. Miller wired President Wattles yesterday that Colonel Roosevelt had assured him that he would come to the Jubilee if he is not nominated for governor of New York.  If he should receive the nomination, as seems altogether likely, he cannot promise further than to say that he will be here if possible.  Secretary Alger of the War department writes that he would like very much to be present, but he cannot determine so far in advance whether his duties will permit it.</p>
                            <p>The idea of organizing a grand spectacular display to be given on the evenings of Jubilee week has been practically dropped.  The management is inclined to the opinion that such an attraction would be to some extent superfluous in view of the magnificent illuminations that in themselves furnish a spectacle that no art could surpass.  To visitors who come to the exposition for a few days or a week these are ample to make the evenings enjoyable and with especially <choice><sic>eloborate</sic><corr>elaborate</corr></choice> displays of fireworks every evening it is believed that no additional spectacular effects will be desirable.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Some Notable Concessions in Fare Announced for Special Days.</head>
                            <p>The prospect for an unprecedented attendance during the remainder of the exposition is emphasized by an apparent tendency on the part of the railroads to break down the barrier of high rates and make concessions that will more nearly meet the demands of the situation.  The Department of Transportation received notice yesterday of a number of rate concessions that are materially better than those which have been previously secured.  For Ak-Sar-Ben week the roads have announced a rate of one fare for the round trip from all points within 200 miles of Omaha and the still better figure of 1 cent a mile from all Western Passenger association points outside of the 200 mile limit.  The tickets will be good for five days in each case and will be on sale October 3 to 6 inside the 200 mile limit and October 3 and 4 at more remote points.  The cent a mile rate from outside points is the most sweeping concession that has yet been received.</p>
                            <p>A rate of 1 cent a mile has also been made from all New Mexico points for New Mexico day, October 10.  For Michigan day, October 4; Ohio day, October 5; New York day, October 8, and Tennessee day, October 18, a rate of one fare for the round trip has been recommended and will probably be approved.  These tickets will all be good for ten days.</p>
                            <p>A very low rate has also been announced for Missouri day, October 10, and this is believed to insure a big crowd from that state.  The rate for the round trip will be $9 from St. Louis, $4 from Kansas City and 80 per cent of the standard one way rate from all other Missouri points.  The tickets will be sold October 8 and 9 and will be good to October 12.</p>
                            <p>A rate of 80 per cent of the standard one way fare will also prevail from all South Dakota points for South Dakota day, October 6.  The tickets will be on sale October 4 and 5 and the limit will expire October 10.  For Georgia day, September 29, there will be a rate of one fare for the <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>The Southwestern Passenger association has notified the exposition management that a rate of 1 cent a mile will probably prevail from all points in its territory during Jubilee week.</p>

                            <p>The 25 cent admission brought out enough people last night to materially supplement the daylight crowd.  The evening concert was enjoyed by an audience of very unusual proportions for a Monday night and the music was rewarded with the same enthusiasm as greeted the opening concert of Innes' band the day before.  The most enjoyable number of the first part was a symposium from "Lohengrin," which was exquisitely rendered, and Mr. Heidelberg's flute solo, "Coming Thro' the Rye," was also received with exceptional favor.  The second part begun with the overture from "Zampa," which received a magnificent rendition, and closed with Buccolossi's familiar fantasie, "The Hunting Scene," which has never been heard more effectively on the grounds.  The finale, the "Star Spangled Banner," was accompanied by a short pyrotechnic display that was a very inspiring climax to the evening's enjoyment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Captain Yancey Makes a Successful Ascension During the Afternoon.</head>
                            <p>The trial trip of the war balloon was successfully made yesterday afternoon.  It had been the intention to get the balloon off this afternoon, but yesterday when Captain Yancey found that he had everything in readiness he concluded he would not wait any longer and at 5:20 o'clock he cut loose and started on the upward trip, accompanied by Sergeant Breide.  In making the ascent 1,000 feet of cable was used, the balloon reaching a height of 600 feet.  The wind was from the north and the balloon drifted south until it rested at a point almost directly over the Administration arch.</p>
                            <p>Considerable interest has centered in the ascent of the war balloon and there was a large crowd about the car when it started on its upward course.  This crowd was augmented and by the time it reached its highest point it was being watched by several thousand pairs of eyes.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the ascent Captain Yancey said: "It was a very satisfactory trial trip.  When we started from the ground there was no breeze to speak of, but when we reached a height of 100 feet there was a strong breeze, which constantly increased.  At 600 feet the wind seemed to be blowing a gale and constantly swayed the balloon and the basket.  Notwithstanding this we would have gone the entire length of our cable, 2,500 feet, had we not accomplished all that we desired to test the balloon, the machinery and the cables."</p>
                            <p>The war balloon weighs, together with the car, about 1,200 pounds and carries 21,000 cubic feet of gas.  It has a lifting capacity of between 1,700 and 1,800 pounds, so that besides its own weight it will carry three men and the necessary instruments used in signaling to the people on the ground.</p>
                            <p>The balloon is of silk, varnished both inside and out.  It is filled with hydrogen gas and is controlled by a cable which, as well as securing the proper movements of the car, is used for telegraphing and telephoning and for bringing it back to the ground.  The cable, which contains twelve strands of nickel and copper wire and is covered with an insulated netting, is unwound from a reel attached to a derrick-like wagon, which in a few days will be supplanted by a two-horse power dynamo.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday when the balloon was at its greatest height Captain Yancey telegraphed and telephoned to the officer on the ground who had charge of the instruments and carried on a conversation.  The basket attached to the balloon carries a complete set of telegraph instruments and a head 'phone and transmitter.</p>
                            <p>This afternoon the balloon will make an ascent at 4 o'clock and each afternoon thereafter.  The starting point of the balloon will be from the vacant space just south of the Transportation building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ten to Fifteen Thousand People Will Be Here from There.</head>
                            <p>The advance guard of the crowd that will be here from Chicago on Saturday of the present week to assist in the proper observance of Chicago day has commenced to arrive.  Yesterday C. N. Bishop, Kossuth Marks and R. T. Perry, three prominent business men of the Windy City, came in for the purpose of arranging for the accommodations of the great crowd that will arrive later in the week.  They spent the day on the exposition grounds, admiring the buildings, the Grand Court and the interesting features.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of Chicago day Mr. Bishop said:  "It would not surprise me in the least to see from 10,000 to 15,000 people here from Chicago.  Our people are enthusiastic and propose to do all in their power to make the occasion a grand success.  A number of our uniformed marching clubs will come on special trains, bringing along their bands that they may make a good appearance in the parade.  The members of the Chicago Board of Trade or at least a great number of them are coming and in addition to them there will be thousands of representative business men and other citizens.  Our people have heard glowing reports from this exposition and they want to come and see for themselves, for the exposition is much better than has been indicated by any description that I have seen."</p>
                            <p>John Due, who has charge of the fireworks, is making great preparations for the display on the evening of Chicago day.  There will be the usual flight of bombs and rockets; there will be a picture of Chicago's mayor and in addition to all of this there will be a painting 200 feet long and thirty-two feet high.  This will be entitled the "Burning of Chicago" and will be illuminated in a manner to represent the great fire of 1871.  High above the picture will be two hands clasped, with the words "Omaha-Chicago."</p>
                            <p>An Indian battle has been arranged for the afternoon of Chicago day and the representatives of the different tribes will do their utmost to furnish entertainment for the guests.  Already the Chicago people are taking a deep interest in this feature.  One of the marching clubs of the city has notified Captain Mercer that the members of the organization will want 250 seats in the grand stand reserved for their exclusive use.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Fisher has been in charge of the Wisconsin state building at the Omaha exposition and has done a great deal to make Wisconsin people in that city feel at home.  He says the fair is a great success, every dollar of indebtedness having been paid by the management and there being a balance in the treasury.  The attendance during the past week has averaged 20,000 a day.  Mr. Fisher says the railroad companies have promised to give Wisconsin people a very low rate to Omaha in October and he expects a large Badger crowd to take advantage of it and see the fine show by which Omaha and the west beyond the Mississippi have covered themselves with glory.</p>

Miss Franklin, who is chief clerk to President Sterrett of the commission, who is now in St. Louis, has received advices that the railroads have made a rate of 1 cent per mile from all points in the state.  The tickets will probably have a ten-day limit, thus giving people plenty of time to stay at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>President Sterrett writes Miss Franklin that he does not think it advisable to have any exercises.  What the people want most is to come to the exposition and enjoy themselves without being compelled to listen to long speeches and participate in set programs.  He says that he expects that the Merchants' League of St. Louis, an organization having a membership of several hundred, will come in a body.</p>

                            <p>John M. Reece, an attorney, and C. R. Cooley, ex-city auditor of Minneapolis, are in the city attending the exposition.  Both of them are enthusiastic over the show and will remain several days <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>The celebration of New Mexico day, which was scheduled for Thursday, has been postponed to October 10.  This action was taken because there are so many local fairs and festivities arranged in the state during this month that the commissioners decided a better attendance could be secured by waiting until later in the season.</p>
                            <p>The original Santiago balloon which was shot to pieces with Spanish bullets during the engagement, arrived at the exposition grounds yesterday and will be placed on exhibit in the Government building.

                            <p>A. L. Hatch and his daughter, Miss Bernice Hatch, who have had charge of the Wisconsin exhibit in the Horticultural building since its installation, have returned home.  From now until the close of the exposition the exhibit will be in charge of William Toole, an extensive fruit grower at Baraboo.  The change is due to the fact that Mr. Hatch has his own personal business at home that requires his entire time and attention.</p>
                            <p>The reserved seats at the fireworks displays will no longer obstruct the view of the people who cannot find an opportunity to patronize them.

Thousands were unable to see the set pieces on account of the amphitheater in front of them and in view of the big crowds that are expected during the remainder of the exposition the management has ordered it removed.</p>
                            <p>Secretary W. R. Bowen of the Nebraska Territorial Pioneers' association has sent out over 500 circulars to members of the organization, calling their attention to the celebration of Old Settlers' day at the exposition Friday and asking them to co-operate to make it a success.  The responses so far received indicate that a large proportion of the pioneers will attend the celebration and as the various county old settlers' organizations are already in line the day promises to be quite an important event.  The program has not yet been determined on, but it is promised that it will be of more than ordinary interest.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Railroads Asked to Bid on Hauling Men to Huntsville.</head>
                            <p>The traffic officials of the western lines having their headquarters and division offices in this city are very busy preparing bids for an extensive movement of troops just ordered in the west.  The troops are to be moved from various posts in the Department of Colorado to Huntsville, Ala., at once.</p>
                            <p>The bids have been requested of the western lines by E. B. Atwood, chief quartermaster of the Department of the Colorado, at Denver.  The sealed proposals will be accepted until 11 o'clock on Wednesday morning, September 28.  The Omaha lines are after the business, but it is possible that a part of the movement may take place through Kansas City and St. Louis.</p>
                            <p>Transportation is asked for the following movements of troops, from the department to Huntsville, Ala., which troops will be routed to avoid Memphis, Tenn., and the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, owing to danger of fever infection, viz.:  From Fort Apache, Ariz., three officers, 179 men, five horses and 5,000 pounds of freight.  From Fort Grant, Ariz., four officers, 353 men, four horses and 10,000 pounds of freight.  From Fort Hauchuca, Ariz., two officers, 250 men, three horses and 25,000 pounds of freight.  From Fort Duchene, Utah, three officers, 163 men, eleven horses and 1,000 pounds of freight.</p>
                            <p>The above figures are approximate, and the freight will be exclusive of the amount to be carried free on each ticket.  It will consist of rations, clothing, etc.  Baggage cars to be furnished for personal effects checked free on each ticket.  It is desired that Pullman standard sleepers be furnished for the officers, allowing one double berth for each officer, and tourist sleepers for the enlisted men, allowing three men to a section.  In submitting rates, please state the net cash rate per capita for the officers and enlisted men, and rate per berth in standard and tourist sleepers, the rate per 100 pounds for the freight, in carloads and less than carloads, and the live stock rate for freight, in carloads and less than carloads, and the live stock rate for the horses.</p>
                            <p>The troops from Forts Grant and Hauchuca, Ariz., will be consolidated at Wilcox, Ariz.  In submitting proposals, the various roads forming the through line must be stated, giving divisions in each case of the amounts accruing to each of the roads interested.  The first and second class passenger tariff, and freight and live stock rates, in effect between the initial points and destination, will also be stated, and the proportions of these rates accruing to each line, with amounts to be deducted on account of land grant and bond-aided indebtedness.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Friday Proclaimed a Holiday Throughout the State for Schools.</head>
                            <head type="sub">RECOMMENDED TO VISIT THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Acting Governor Harris Issues His Proclamation and Superintendent Jackson Urges that All Schools Take Advantage.</head>
                            <p>County Superintendent Bodwell says the idea of having a school children's day at the exposition is being taken up with enthusiasm by the parents and teachers, and that the indications are that Omaha will see one of the prettiest as well as grandest spectacles of its history when the thousands of school children from all over the state are gathered at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The idea originated with the Woman's Bureau of Education.  They communicated their desire to the governor and James E. Harris, acting governor during Governor Holcomb's absence from the state, lost no time in taking action.  The result was that Friday, September 30, was designated as school children's day, and a proclamation was issued by Acting Governor Harris recommending that that day be observed as a holiday generally throughout the state, and urging upon the school boards, principals and teachers the importance of encouraging the attendance of the school children at the exposition on that date.</p>
                            <p>A circular has since been sent out by State Superintendent W. R. Jackson to all county superintendents, school boards, principals and teachers, recommending that they make it as convenient as possible for the pupils of all ages to take advantage of a visit to the exposition on this day, which he calls children's jubilee day.  He urges the matter in the following:</p>
                            <p>To many of the pupils in our schools this may be the opportunity of a lifetime.  The exposition is a great educational institution.  It furnishes a line of practical education that is not obtained from the study of books.  Thousands of Nebraska <choice><sic>choldren</sic><corr>children</corr></choice> prepared work for our great educational exhibit and they should be permitted to visit the gallery of the Manufactures building and see the same.  It is pronounced by leading educators one of the finest educational exhibits ever displayed.  It is not often that a state is favored with such advantages as are now found within the borders of our state.  A day spent in the Government building alone is worth more to the average child than several weeks in the ordinary routine work of the school room.</p>
                            <p>The admission to the grounds for the children will be only 15 cents, and an effort is to be made to have the railroads reduce their rates, so as to get as many of the children here as possible.  All the concessions will reduce their prices also.</p>

                            <head type="sub">First Session of the Transmississippi Gathering Meets at the First Methodist Church.</head>
                            <p>At 2 o'clock this afternoon the Transmississippi Sunday School congress convened in the First Methodist church.  For an opening session of a convention the attendance was good, but it is expected to be largely increased even before an adjournment is taken late this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The congress was opened with the usual devotional exercises and was then formally called to order by George G. Wallace of this city, president of the Nebraska State Sunday School association.  He explained the objects and purposes of the congress at considerable length.</p>
                            <p>The first work of the congress was a bible study, which was conducted by Rev. George R. Merrill, D. D., of Chicago.  The topic was the "Method of Four Steps," and was illustrated by the Twenty-third psalm.  A symposium of addresses on Sunday school work followed.  The first subject was "Normal Work," and was explained by W. J. Sennelroth of St. Louis, editor of the International Evangel; the second was on the "Home Department," by Marion Lawrance of Toledo, general secretary of the Ohio Sunday School association, and the third was "House to House Visitation," by Hugh Cork of Minneapolis, field secretary for the state of Minnesota.</p>
                            <p>A song service will be held at the church tonight.  It will be conducted by Prof. E. O. Excell of Chicago.</p>

                            <p>Attached to the morning train from the east over the Burlington road today were three special cars from Glenwood, Ia.  They brought a party of eighty feeble-minded children, inmates of the asylum at that place, who were under the charge of Assistant Superintendent Maridge, on an excursion to the exposition.  They were met at the station by a party of older inmates of the asylum&#8212;mostly boys, who had driven from Glenwood this morning in wagons.  This party numbered sixty.  All were taken by cars to the exposition grounds to enjoy a day's outing.  They will return tonight.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Exposition will have as its guests tomorrow the Twenty-fourth infantry, U. S. A.  The regiment of colored regulars that won such warm praise from the highest military authorities for deeds of heroism and valor throughout the Cuban campaign, particularly at El Caney and Santiago, is to stop here on its way from Camp Wikoff, Long Island, to Fort Douglas, Utah to see the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Arrangements for the visit of the brave soldiers to the exposition are being perfected.  President Wattles has given his assurance that the regiment will be admitted to the grounds free of charge.  Captain Baxter, acting quartermaster of the Department of the Missouri, says there will be no objection to the slight delay in the movement of the troops in order that they may see the exposition.  The Union Pacific railroad has shown its good will toward the troops by agreeing to carry them westward from here after they have visited the exposition instead of starting them out as soon as they arrive here.</p>
                            <p>It is expected that the Twenty-fourth will arrive here about 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.  The regiment is traveling in two special trains, and will come into Omaha over the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific railroad.  The route from New York to Salt Lake City is over three lines:  The West Shore, the Nickel Plate, the Rock Island and the Union Pacific.  There is no great hurry about the movement as is shown by the fact that the soldiers left New York on Sunday evening and will not arrive here until Wednesday morning.  The regiment occupies two special trains, one of fifteen cars and the other of nineteen cars.</p>

                            <p>So far as is known now there will be no special exercises at the exposition grounds in honor of the visiting soldiers tomorrow.  It is thought best to allow all the time to the men for them to see the attractions of the big show as they may please.  There will probably be a parade through the city from the Union Pacific depot out to the exposition grounds following the arrival of the special trains in the morning.</p>
                            <p>The opinion of the Twenty-fourth entertained by the officers who saw the colored men fight in the Santiago campaign is shown by the following interview with Lieutenant Preston Cartright of Roosevelt's Rough Riders, who took the place of Captain "Bucky" O'Neil on the death of that officer:  "This little experience at Santiago, to and from, was simply a gentle reminder of my early life on the plains.  The only complaint I have to make is that we were not as well armed as our antagonists.  The Spaniard, with his superior gun and smokeless powder, had the advantage.  There is one thing the American people should not overlook, and that is that 100,000 volunteers could never have accomplished at Santiago what the United States regular army did.  We would have been driven into the sea but for the regulars.  This country does not know the debt it owes to the Twenty-fourth infantry, colored."</p>

                            <p>The citizens of Salt Lake City are planning a mammoth reception for the Twenty-fourth on its return to the Mormon capital.  The regiment was stationed there at Fort Douglas at the outbreak of the war, and on its return will be given a great welcome home.  Had the original schedule of sending the regiment through here in the morning been carried out the soldiers would have reached Salt Lake City in the evening, an inopportune time for any public reception.  By stopping here tomorrow to spend the day at the exposition they will arrive at Salt Lake City in the morning, pleasantly breaking the long trip here, giving them their only opportunity to see the exposition and landing them at their home city in much better season.  The thoughtful change in the program is due to the foresight of S. A. Hutchison, assistant general passenger agent of the Union Pacific railroad.</p>
                            <p>The First regiment of cavalry, U. S. A., leaves Camp Wikoff, Long Island, today for the west.  The headquarters of the First will be established at Fort Meade, S. D.  One troop of the cavalry will go to Fort Niobrara, this state; another troop will go to Fort Robinson, this state, and a third troop will go to Fort Washkie, Wyo.  These troops will relieve troops of cavalry belonging to the Eighth regiment of regular cavalry which are to be sent at once to Huntsville, Ala.</p>

                            <p>The most wonderful Chinese magician ever seen in this country or any other country is Ching Ling Foo at the Chinese Village on the West Midway, and his work this season at that popular resort has attracted widespread attention.  This noted man brought the Ching Ling Foo company here from Pekin the early part of the season.  The company consists of himself, his wife, the slack wire performer, Gee Fook Quai and Sui Gee Ti, the 2½-year-old singer and dancer, Hoin Foo Quai, juggler, and Duck Fook, horizontal bar performer and acrobat.  The company is undoubtedly the finest company of the kind that ever visited America.  It has been organized for six years and in that time it has become famous in the leading cities of China.  It is quite probable that the troupe will tour the United States after the close of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"In Gay Paris" on the West Midway, the new show which opened a few days ago, has sprung suddenly into popularity and the success of it is assured.  Among the pictures presented is that of Little Egypt, who created such a sensation at the Seeley supper in New York City.  There are eleven other magnificent pictures.  The machine which projects these moving pictures is of the finest quality and all the pictures are superior in every respect.</p>
                            <p>The thousands of people in this country who have never seen a real live ostrich throng the South Africa Ostrich Farm, on the West Midway, every day.  They argue that inasmuch as there are but few birds in America, they will probably not have another opportunity to see one of the monsters from which such beautiful plumage is plucked.  The attendance last week was immense and from the way it has started off this week the management will have no reason to complain on Saturday night.</p>
                            <p>A balloon ascension without the parachute leap would not be complete and learning that the war balloons lacked this feature, Darkness and Dawn volunteered to supply it.  A parachute was hastily prepared and Jimmy, one of the baby skeletons from the infernal regions, agreed to make the ascension, and leap.  Jimmy's nerve failed him and when the balloon sailed from earth his teeth were set in death-like determination.  When the balloon had reached an altitude of 2,500 feet, a tiny parachute was seen to drop from the lookout of the balloon, open and sail off into space.  His makeup lacked pockets, so in his hand he carried passes to Darkness and Dawn, with which he is going to reward the charitable person who feeds and cares for him.  Anyone learning of Jimmy's whereabouts will kindly inform the managers of Darkness and Dawn.</p>

                            <p>In connection with the art congress it is the purpose to start the long delayed museum contemplated in the ordinance creating a public library in Omaha, and for which the rooms on the third floor of the library building were originally planned.</p>

                            <p>The Art museum in Philadelphia and the Field Art museum in Chicago were both founded on the nuclei collected from the Centennial and the World's fair, and a movement has been inaugurated and is progressing favorably here for like acquisitions from the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  It is exciting a widespread interest in the community and has been taken up formally by the Woman's club and the directors of the public library and Western Art association.  Many contributions of rare statuary, potteries, archeological curios, paintings, drawings and articles of dress and virtu have already been received and the directors of the public library will be thankful for any loans of articles suitable for such purposes, and they will provide for the preservation of the same properly labeled with the name of donor or depositor.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition before its opening, in lieu of prizes or diplomas to be presented to its exhibitors, appropriated $5,000 for the purchase of pictures and other articles of art presented at the great show now in progress.  This being much more satisfactory to exhibitors than the barren honor of a prize or diploma, the proprietors anticipated little difficulty in making a creditable start.  These purchases, together with such statuary as is available, will be the central mass around which it is hoped a large, prosperous and creditable museum may be established for the culture-loving people of Omaha, to be open at all times for their inspection and enjoyment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Signal Corps Sends Big Balloon Up 1,000 Feet Till Wind Interferes.</head>
                            <head type="sub">High Upper Current Carries It Over Midway, and a Big Crowd Goes Where Not Wanted.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Reels, Telephones and Telegraph Work Perfectly--Smokers Driven Away--Goes Up Daily at 4 P. M.</head>
                            <p>Pretty as a new toy the big war balloon looked yesterday afternoon on its trial trip to see if everything was in satisfactory shape, especially the reels and cables.  It was the plan to quietly make the test and avoid a crowd if possible, but as the big fellow rose from the ground east of the transportation building and floated over and past Midway the crowds swarmed in anyhow, fell over the cables and reels, asked foolish questions and demonstrated itself generally.  But everything worked like a charm, assuring future successes, and crowds are hereafter most cordially invited.</p>
                            <p>The balloon is a big bag of silk, varnished and treated to make it impervious to gas and air.  Over it all is a net covering, ending in rope at the bottom, to which is suspended the wicker basket for the aeronauts.  Another row of ropes hangs from the net two-thirds of the way down, and that is for fastening hundred pound sacks of crushed stone for anchorage when the balloon is wanted at home.  Two reels unwound the two cables with equal speed to permit the balloon to ascend, at each reel being placed four or five well muscled men.</p>
                            <p>Captain Yancey and Sergeant Briede, an old-time aeronaut before he joined the signal corps, made the initial ascension, intending to go to the end of a couple thousand feet of cable at least, judging from the light breeze on the ground.  But 100 feet up a heavy wind from the north struck them, and after 1,000 feet had been unreeled they were only 600 feet above the ground, and the wind was whipping the gas from the balloon at a furious rate.  Then they telephoned down to come back, for either cable is composed of a central core of sixteen insulated copper wires, surrounded by a sheathing of twelve steel wires, over which is an insulated coating.  The copper wires are used for telephoning, and the steel wires for telegraphing.  Both telephoning and telegraphing were tried yesterday with success.</p>
                            <p>When the balloon came down, not in the collapsed condition of the ordinary hot air balloons, but fat and full and pulling up as hard as a dentist on an aching molar, all there was in the trick of alighting was the act of stepping from the basket, as easy as getting off a motor car.  Then a few sacks of ballast were hooked on, but not enough to anchor the big fellow, which was escorted around to his big house with the whole side left out for a door.  He was then anchored down, and all of the interlopers were driven away, those smoking being given an extra hustle.</p>
                            <p>"There are 21,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas in the balloon, and if it explodes there will be nothing left in the neighborhood," explained Captain Yancey.  "There is some gas about here now, escaped from the generator, and if it comes in contact with a cigar, the fire will go straight to the balloon and everything will be gone."</p>
                            <p>The gas remains in the balloon indefinitely, except as whipped out in high winds, the estimated loss yesterday being 1,000 feet.  After awhile air leaks in, mixes with the gas and so reduces the carrying power that the balloon must be wholly refilled perhaps each four weeks, the cost being from $80 to $125.  The balloon is never filled up tight, for it would burst on going to a great height, where the air is rarified and liable to permit an expansion of the gas.  So room is always left for expansion.</p>
                            <p>The carrying power of the big fellow is about 1,800 pounds, but since he must carry his own weight along with the basket and a long line of cable, 1,200 pounds must be allowed for him, leaving only 600 pounds for his guests, who on this account and size of the basket are usually limited to two, although three sometimes go up.</p>
                            <p>Since it is such hard and aggravating work for the men at the bottom to operate the reels, especially when there are five weeks of it in sight, Captain Yancey is arranging for a five-horse power motor to do the hard work.</p>
                            <p>The ascensions will be made daily hereafter when the weather is fair at 4 p. m., and on off days interesting work will be <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>One of the bright and happy little incidents which help to make life the more pleasant in living and likewise cement the ties of friendship, occurred at Chiquita's reception parlors on the Midway yesterday.  The beautiful little Cuban had withdrawn to her private apartments after receiving a large company and Prof. W. G. Rollins, the gentlemanly master of ceremonies, had taken advantage of a few minutes interval to amuse the throng in front with a <choice><sic>clarionet</sic><corr>clarinet</corr></choice> solo, when Mr. Frank C. Bostwick, manager of Chiquita, unexpectedly appeared on the scene.  Motioning to Mr. Rollins that he had something urgent to say, and taking his faithful representative by the hand he addressed him in a few cheerful words, at the same time presenting to Mr. Rollins a beautiful diamond ring in token of his personal esteem for Mr. Rollins' long and efficient services as lecturer for Chiquita.  Mr. Rollins was taken completely by surprise and for a few moments was overcome with feelings.  His acceptance of the gift followed in a very clever manner.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Will Travel From Washington to Omaha Without Stopping.</head>
                            <p>Washington, D. C., Sept. 26.&#8212;Senator Thurston of Nebraska and Manager W. N. Babcock of the department of transportation of the Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha had an interview with President McKinley today regarding the details of his trip to the exposition.  Acting Secretary of War Meiklejohn accompanied the senator.</p>
                            <p>The original plan to start the special train bearing the president and party on October 10, arriving at Omaha on the evening of the following day, will not be changed.  This arrangement allows a daylight ride through the state of Iowa.  The president is anxious to extend his trip westward as far as Denver, but owing to the time involved has not fully determined to do so.  He will be in Omaha October 12.</p>
                            <p>It was decided to run the train through to Omaha, making practically no stop at Chicago on the out-trip.  Returning the president is to be in Chicago on either October 18 or 19, at the peace jubilee there.  The presidential trip as now planned is likely to occupy a fortnight, though the details are not fully settled.</p>
                            <p>The exposition committee announces that Secretaries Gage, Wilson and Bliss, Postmaster General Emory Smith, Major General Miles, Major General Wheeler and Commodore Philips, U. S. N., are among those who have accepted invitations to attend the exposition.</p>

More enthusiasts in the production of flax, hemp and ramie for the fiber were present than at any of the previous meetings.  The constitution and by-laws, reported by a committee, were approved, and these vice presidents were elected: New York, Mr. Harthorn, New York city; New Jersey, James Elmslie, Paterson; Illinois, Joseph G.

                            <p>Wichita Indians yesterday turned out as a tribe en masse to trip the light fantastic in the horn dance, a great religious ceremonial of the old days to pray for the increase of the buffalo, modified in these later days to pray not only for the increase, but the return of the big quadruped.  Like all of the special ceremonials, much previous attention was given to costumes, the braves doing some deep thinking to figure out the least amount of raiment necessary, that room might be given for wild displays of rainbow painting.  A big crowd of palefaces enjoyed the antics, if not the soul of the occasion.</p>

                            <p>The Southwestern Passenger association, St. Louis, has recommended a rate of 1 cent a mile from its territory for all of peace jubilee week.</p>
                            <p>For Missouri and St. Louis day, October 10, the flat rate of $9 for the round trip has been made from St. Louis, and of $4 from Kansas City, and a rate of 1 cent a mile from all other points in Missouri.  The tickets will be on sale October 9, 10 and 11, good for return October 12.</p>
                            <p>For Ak-Sar-Ben week, October 3-7, tickets good for five days will be sold from all points in Nebraska within 200 miles of Omaha for on fare for the round trip.

                            <head type="sub">Result of a Dispute About Closing of Schlitz Pavilion Sunday Night.</head>
                            <p>H. B. Engelstadt, who was for two years engineer at the Creighton Medical college, and who is one of the exposition guards, is lying at the emergency hospital on the grounds with a cracked upper jaw, cut and swollen lips and other face bruises as a result of a dispute with Fritz Mueller, the proprietor of the Schlitz pavilion, about the closing of the pavilion Sunday night.</p>
                            <p>The story told at the guard house is that Engelhardt entered the pavilion at 11:30 last night and ordered that the sale of beer must be stopped at that time, according to the rules.  He remained to see that the order was carried out and refused to leave on the order of the proprietor.  Thereupon Mueller struck him with a chair, inflicting the injuries described, and he was attacked by several who were in the place.  Engelstadt made his way to the guard station, and at once Captain Covel, at the head of thirty of the night relief, went up and closed the pavilion.</p>
                            <p>As Mueller was going away from the pavilion he was met by Sergeant G. S. Treynor and Guard E. P. Hansen, who asked him to come to the station.  Mueller drew his revolver and refused.  His son, Otto, took hold of his arm and Mueller went his way.</p>
                            <p>Mueller yesterday admitted the assault with the chair and drawing the revolver.  He said that Engelstadt "had it in for him" because he had been refused free beer at his place and Sunday afternoon had told him that he would arrest him the next change he got.  He says that Sunday night, though the barkeeper was just ready to go away and the waiters had left, Engelstadt took hold of him and undertook to lead him from the place.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday forenoon Mueller went to the police station in the city and told the circumstances to Captain Sigwart, who then told him that, before taking him into custody, further developments in the case or a warrant would be awaited.</p>
                            <p>Later Mueller called at the guard house and told his side of the story.</p>

                            <p>A delegation of prominent Catholic clergymen are at the Millard, having come to see the exposition.  The party is composed of Bishop Lenihan, Marshalltown, Ia.; McLaughlin, Clinton, Ia., Fulton, St. Louis, and Dr. Phelan, St. Louis, the famous editor of the Watchman.  They will spend several days in the city.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Phelan, speaking for the party, said they made it up at St. Louis to meet at Leavenworth and join in a church celebration, and then come to Omaha to spend a week.</p>
                            <p>"The exposition is wonderful," said Dr. Phelan, "and almost as good as the World's fair.  The night view looking west up the lagoon is simply beyond comprehension.  The greatest show is the Indian congress.  A few years and such shows will be impossible.  The red man is passing away&#8212;the world, so far as he is concerned, is at its close&#8212;and to our grandchildren an Indian congress like the one out there will be out of the question.  We will never see another.  The present congress is a world's wonder, and worth many times the price.  I am sure it is not properly appreciated.  The fish display, the electric lighting and the architecture is better than the Chicago show.  It should be opened next year, by all means.</p>
                            <p>"You may look for thousands from St. Louis," he added, "within the next three weeks.  They are becoming interested now, and will come by the hundreds."</p>

                            <p>For the benefit of the children on all children's day, next Friday, a fine exhibition of day fireworks will be given on the plaza at 1:30 p. m.</p>
                            <p>Elaborate fireworks will be given on the north tract Wednesday and Saturday nights.  The fireworks Saturday will be a whale.  That is Chicago day, and all Chicago will be burnt up.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Alger has written General Manager Clarkson that he will be here peace jubilee week if he can.</p>

                            <p>There was no sham battle at the Indian Village yesterday, as advertised.  There is a mix-up between the exposition management and Captain Mercer, in charge of the congress.  When the battles began Captain Mercer arranged with Concessionaire Cummins to put in seats for a grand stand, tickets to be sold for 10 cents each, half to go to Cummins and half to the Indians for pin money.  When Cummins first obtained the concession for seats at the exposition he was to pay 20 per cent of the gross receipts for it.</p>
                            <p>The exposition demanded 20 per cent from the sale of seats for the battle.  Captain Mercer said that the Indian congress was a government affair, not a Midway concession, and not required to pay percentages.</p>
                            <p>The exposition insisted upon its 20 per cent from Cummins, and Cummins referred the matter to Mercer, and there is the job unfinished.</p>
                            <p>It is not doubted but that peace will be promulgated in time for another hot battle Friday or Saturday.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Nebraska State Millers' association held a session yesterday afternoon at the Commercial club rooms.  It was presided over by President D. M. Dean of Seward, a prominent miller, while Secretary O. C. Holmes of Omaha looked after the social welfare of the guests.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dean, in his address, said he regretted so few were present, yet assured those on hand that this should cause no depression.  He referred to the other gatherings that have been held in Omaha, and stated that none lay closer to the welfare of the while people than does the Millers' association.  He said it was the duty of the members to exert their influence on the legislature body that good laws be enacted protecting the millers in their efforts to put on the market nothing but pure products.  Railroads also should be looked after as to rates and a united effort made to place Nebraska flour where it belongs, at the head of the list.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of railways, O. J. Cooper of Humboldt said he had just learned that he had been paying 2 cents per hundred weight too much on flour and had remedied it.  All the millers needed was a little practical investigation and they would get their <choice><sic>deserts</sic><corr>desserts</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>Fisheries and irrigation were discussed briefly.  President Dean astonished several members by stating that the supreme court had held that the state fishery law was invalid, and advocated the millers taking the matter in hand and seeing that the new law to be passed contains none of the obnoxious provisions of the old law, and be made less onerous for the milling industry.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Cooper said that the millers' discount on shipments of grain to the mills is due to the Millers' association.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEBRASKA'S SURPLUS CROP.</head>
                            <p>In discussing "What shall we do with the surplus of Nebraska's 50,000,000 bushel wheat crop" everybody took a hand.  Mr. Cooper said he did not know what to do with the surplus unless more mills were built, as the present capacity of the 265 mills of the state was not sufficient take care of the big crop on hand.</p>
                            <p>A. L. Johnson of Crete said that the mills should grind the surplus into flour and the association do its duty in keeping prices up to a living figure.</p>
                            <p>C. E. Black of the Pierce Milling company held that the Nebraska prices are way ahead of the Kansas prices, where the bottom has been slashed out.</p>
                            <p>"Continued improvement of Nebraska seed wheat" was taken up.  John Graff of Tecumseh held that seed wheat is on the improve in this state.  He said that the millers could easily get the farmers to sow good wheat and advised that old Turkey wheat be used.</p>
                            <p>The Turkey seed wheat was then taken up and handled promiscuously.</p>
                            <p>"Ethics of the use of flour brands" was discussed.  C. L. Meiling of Wahoo was to have read a paper but did not appear.  All members agreed that Nebraska made flour was good enough for anyone, and none better, and that no miller should put Nebraska flour in a Kansas or Minnesota sack to get trade.  Secretary Holmes told what the Manufacturers and Consumers association had done to cause Nebraska flour to be generally used, and related an instance of a big wholesale flour dealer in Omaha who is soon to discard outside flour and handle only Nebraska products.</p>
                            <p>"Practical Points in Milling," by A. <unclear reason="covered"/> Vandell of Loomis, was not discussed.  Mr. Vandell was absent, as was R. A. Sw<unclear reason="covered"/> of Chicago, who was down for a paper on "Application of Electric Power."</p>

                            <p>The big war balloon did not go up yesterday, because of the high wind which made such a proceeding dangerous.  All is in working order for the first fine day that does come along, however.</p>
                            <p>Monday evening some one was testing the gas valve to see if it was working properly, and if the gas could be let out at the top at the right time in an emergency.  The valve was well covered with soap so that it would close tightly, but the extra precautions seemed to have prevented it from closing at all.  So a slow leak started, and half the gas was gone by morning.</p>

                            <p>Many suggestions have been made from time to time about what a beautiful thing it would be to take all of the poor children of Omaha to the exposition for a day and give them a treat that would other wise be missed.  No one volunteered to take charge of the benevolence till the Home Fire Insurance company proposed to the exposition management that it would see to selecting the worthy children, paying their car fare to the exposition would put the admission at the lowest figure.

                            <p>Scandia's sons and daughters, <del>aided by a liberal sprinkling of Illinoisans hailing from McDonough county,</del> swelled the attendance at the exposition today.  It was their day.  Nature greeted them with her most gracious smiles and the stately buildings robed all in white, as for a reception, extended a most cordial welcome to children of the land of the midnight sun, and to the visitors from the Sucker state.</p>
                            <p>It seems as if many of those who contemplate visiting the exposition are now holding off in anticipation of the great attractions that are to come next week and the week after.  If the fine weather continues until then, there is no doubt that some records will be broken.  Just now those who attend are making the most of the opportunity afforded to make a study of the exhibits without the annoyance of a crowd jostling at their elbows, and without the counter-attractions of speeches and receptions.  In this they are showing their wisdom.  There is plenty of interest in the fair itself to take all the time that one cannot spend in viewing it.  The exhibits are now in the most presentable shape, new features being added in all department nearly every day.  So the visitors finds that his time is put in to good advantage all the while.  The icewater tanks are not as popular as earlier in the season.  Neither are parasols.  And the lunch basket is not such a burden as it once was.  Taken all in all, now is the time to come, to see the exposition at its best and to carry away pleasant memories of the glories and wonders of the White City.</p>
                            <p>The usual band concerts were enjoyed to the utmost this morning.  The Indians drew a large share of the visitors.</p>

                            <p>At 10:30 the Swedish-Americans repaired to the Auditorium, where appropriate exercises were held.  They filled the hall.  The program included an address of welcome by General Manager T. S. Clarkson and response by P. J. Sward, president of the Augustana synod.  This was delivered in Swedish.  Prof. O. Olsson, president of Augustana college, delivered the oration.  He said that he believed the prairie schooner is the most powerful battleship of modern times.  It played the important part in the conquest of the western prairies, where roses have been planted instead of sage brushes and the plains are studded with clusters of happy homes.  And from it all there has arisen the White City, a triumph of peace more inspiring than the victories of Manila or Santiago, for there was no glory or honor in store for the pioneer who broke his heart-strings and the ties of neighborly affection and wandered out across the trackless waste to build a new country and mould the great states of Kansas and Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>After a vocal solo by Miss Edla Lund, an original poem, written for the occasion, was read by Rev. Ludwig Holmes of Burlington, Ia.  The exercises continue this afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>There will be a grand display of fireworks on the north tract this evening at 9 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>The exposition management has set apart Friday of this week for the reunion of the pioneer settlers of Nebraska.  The annual meeting of the Nebraska Territorial Pioneers' association will be held at the Nebraska building on the exposition grounds on Friday at noon.  The remainder of the day will be devoted to sightseeing.  The association has a membership of about 400, including many of the representative citizens of the state.  It is expected that over 300 members will be in attendance.  Ex-Governor Furnas is president of the association and W. R. Bowen is secretary.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plans Are Cut Out for a Genuine Old-Fashioned Celebration.</head>
                            <p>The Georgians are coming in large numbers to the exposition.  They are coming to assist in the observance of Georgia day, which is set for Friday of this week, and they are also coming to attend the exposition and participate in the exercises attending the dedication of the State building.  The train bearing of the Georgians left Atlanta last night and will arrive in Omaha over the Missouri Pacific at 12:55 Thursday afternoon.  The exercises will be held in the Auditorium Friday forenoon, at which time and place President Wattles will deliver the address of welcome.  This will be replied to by Commissioner Henry Richardson, who will be followed by E. Rosewater, who will address the audience, and particularly the members of the Georgia Press association, of which there will be seventy-five, many of whom will be accompanied by their wives.  This address will be responded to by Henry Cabaniss, president of the Georgia Press association and also business manager of the Atlanta Journal.  Following this John Temple Graves and other noted orators of Georgia will speak.</p>
                            <p>Governor Atkinson of Georgia has written ex-Governor Northen that he will be here if his health will permit.  However, he has been ill for some days and it is doubtful if he will be able to attend.  His entire staff, however, will be present.  In all it is probable that the party will number several hundred.  Having their own train and being in a position to return when they please, it is likely that the members of the party will remain several days before going home.</p>
                            <p>During the afternoon the members of the Georgia party will lunch at one of the Viaduct restaurants, after which they will visit the different state and main buildings of the exposition.  In the evening there will be fireworks on the North tract and a special concert on the Plaza.  In addition to the music and in anticipation of some of the features of the Peace Jubilee, there will be a fine display of stereopticon views thrown upon the screen of the band stand on the Plaza.  There will be a large sized portrait of Henry W. Grady, who for years prior to his death was one of the leading newspaper men and orators of the United States.  There will be a picture of General John B. Gordon, the commander of the Confederate Veterans' association, tendering the support of all members of the order to President McKinley in the recent war with Spain; Ben Hill and "Fighting Joe" Wheeler.  Then there will be the picture of a Georgia boy&#8212;Lieutenant Eberhardt&#8212;who hoisted the stars and stripes over the Philippines, presenting the islands to the United States.  In connection with this there will be pictures of General Fitz Hugh Lee, Russell B. Harrison and Alger Satoris, the grandson of the late General U. S. Grant.  But of all, the best of the pictures will be that of the North Carolina boy&#8212;Ensign Bagley&#8212;who was the first to give his life in the late war that forever cemented the friendship of the north and the south.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the Georgia day exercises, ex-Governor Northen, who is the president of the state commission and who has been here almost since the opening of the exposition, said:  "We may not come in as large numbers as do the residents of some of the nearby states.  But what we may lack in numbers we will make up for in loyalty and by showing our friendship for the exposition and the people of the north.  We feel and realize that we are the people of one great country and are bound to one another by ties of brotherly friendship that can never be broken.  There is no north, no south, but instead there is a united country, all working for one cause, the upbuilding of the greatest and best nation on the face of the globe.  It is to furnishing the most convincing evidence of this that brings the Georgians to Omaha at this time.</p>
                            <p>"We know that the exposition has been a good thing in more ways than one.  It has brought together the people from all parts of the United States and has made them feel that they are all members of one great family, and, better still, it has helped to wipe out and drive away all sectional feelings that might have heretofore <unclear reason="torn"/>d.  In a financial way it has been of great benefit to Georgia, for by making our exhibit and exploiting our resources it has resulted in sending many of the people of the north to the south, there to buy our lands and invest in our products.  The effects of the exposition will be felt in the south and especially in Georgia for years to come and I am certain that when our people come here next Friday they will be warmly welcomed."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Entries Are Numerous and Competitors Are Already Arriving.</head>
                            <p>There is a great show of activity around the dairy building, where preparations are under way for the live stock exhibit, which opens Monday.  The barns for the housing of the animals are nearly all completed and the workmen are now erecting a pavilion and amphitheater, enclosing the ring where the stock is to be shown.  The first competitor to send his entry was W. P. Harned of Bunceton, Mo., whose herd arrived yesterday.</p>
                            <p>From present indications the exhibit will surpass anything of the kind that has ever been held in this country, that of the World's fair not excluded.  This conclusion is reached by an estimate of the number of applications which have already been filed with the bureau of live stock.  It is expected that there will be 700 entries of cattle, 900 of swine, 600 of sheep, 300 of horses, besides other miscellaneous entries.  There will be exhibits from all over the United States and even some stock raisers from Canada have signified their desire to enter the competition for the premiums.</p>
                            <p>The list of premiums offered by the exposition management amounts to $35,000.  Besides this there is a total of $15,000 in special premiums offered by various firms and associations.  So there is a great inducement for those interested in stock breeding to bring their pets into the ring.  It would be difficult to foretell in which division there will be the keenest competition.  There will probably be more Hereford cattle shown than any other stock.  It is expected that there will be sixteen head in the ring at one time.</p>
                            <p>The dates for the exhibit of the various divisions of live stock are as follows:  Cattle, horses, jacks, jennets, mules, sheep and swine, Monday, October 3, to Saturday, October 22, inclusive, and the exhibit of fat stock will be from Monday, October 17, to Saturday, October 22, inclusive.</p>

                            <p>The Santiago war balloon did not soar toward the clouds yesterday.  There were two reasons for its not going on its trip.  One was because the wind was too heavy and Captain Yancey did not care to take the chances of sending up the car.  There was another reason.  Monday night after the balloon made the trial trip it was housed and a guard placed over it to prevent its being tampered with.  Yesterday when it was examined it was discovered that during the night some person had been making an investigation of how the balloon was operated.  The person or persons had opened the valve in the bottom of the car and upon satisfying the prompting curiosity had failed to close the valve.  As a result nearly half of the gas had leaked out.  Yesterday the balloon was refilled and at 4 o'clock this afternoon it will be ready for the trip.</p>

                            <p>Mrs. Carolina Shaw Brooks, who does figures in butter, is busily engaged in modeling busts of President and Mrs. McKinley in the refrigerator car in the Dairy building.  She hopes to have the work finished by the time of the arrival of President McKinley and that he may be prevailed upon to examine the figures during his stay at the exposition during the Peace Jubilee week.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ex-Residents of the Empire State Making Their Arrangements.</head>
                            <p>A meeting of native New Yorkers was held Monday evening in the New York State building to make arrangements for the entertainment of the visitors coming from that state on New York day, which will be October 8.  President Wattles of the exposition occupied the chair and W. H. Roberson acted as secretary.  Mr. Wattles stated that the features of the day's celebration would be of unusual interest, including an address by Chauncey M. Depew.  He advised that this would be an excellent opportunity for New Yorkers resident in Omaha to show the representatives of their own state some attention.</p>

                            <p>After some discussion it was suggested by H. T. Clarke that steps be taken to effect a state organization with headquarters at Omaha and auxiliaries throughout the state.  J. E. Riley endorsed the suggestion and urged that the present was the best time to start such a movement.  On motion of Judge Eleazer Wakeley action was deferred until a meeting could be called at the Commercial club.  The committee for the entertainment of the New Yorkers was then appointed as follows: Judge Wakeley, H. T. Clarke, W. H. Roberson and W. D. Meade, jr.</p>
                            <p>Among those present at the meeting were: G. W. Wattles, Major George L. Dennis, Judge Eleazer Wakeley, C. G. Van Ness, W. H. Roberson, P. L. Perrine, A. M. Wheeler, W. H. Mulcahy, H. T. Clarke, J. E. Riley, W. D. Mead, L. D. Stilson, York, Neb.; Henry Knodell, L. M. Bennett, John W. Hosier, J. E. Wiggins, George P. Moore, Dr. J. T. Kinsler, Joseph F. Kelly, D. J.

                            <p>Chairman Kierstead of the Board of County Commissioners is prevailing upon the exposition management to induce that organization to set aside a date for Omaha and Douglas County day at the exposition.  He is of the opinion that the date should be fixed for some time about the middle of the month.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of an Omaha and Douglas County day, Chairman Kierstead said:  "The members of the board and the members of the board and the city council will work in harmony in this matter.  We must get together and upon that day make the attendance a top-notcher.  We will advise the closing of all of the business houses in Omaha and South Omaha and the country towns.  It must be a general holiday, one when the people will show their loyalty to the exposition by attending in a body.  By putting forth an effort, I am convinced that on that day we can push the attendance up to 100,000, making it the biggest day in the history of the exposition."</p>

                            <p>Commissioner Leeson has succeeded in having October 10 named as New Mexico day and is actively engaged in arranging for the festivities that will attend the occasion.  He expects that most of the territorial officers will be present, bringing with them many people from the cities and towns.  The railroads have made a low rate, which Commissioner Leeson says will induce many people to come.</p>
                            <p>While it is possible that there will be no set program for New Mexico day, owing to the illness of the governor, who may be prevented from coming to Omaha, there will be exercises of some kind and an opportunity given for the people from the territory to meet and mingle with the people of the northwest.</p>

                            <p>There was a dance at the Indian camp last night, participated in by about 100 Indians, painted in all of the colors of the rainbow and clothed in the most scanty apparel.  It was witnessed by a large number of exposition visitors and was pronounced a swell affair and an up-to-date function.  The dance was what is known as an "Omaha dance," members of the different tribes taking part.</p>
                            <p>The music for the dance last night at the Indian camp was supplied by the same old orchestra, the only instrument being a drum, out of which half a dozen Indians beat the most doleful sounds that ever floated out upon the night air.  However, the Indians kept time to this music and danced so long as the hat gathered pennies in its rounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Georgians, Old Settlers and Children to Share the Honors Tomorrow.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Royal Welcome to the Delegation From the Souther State Has Been Prepared.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Old-Timers Are to Swap Stories at the Nebraska Building--Children Coming Too, From Everywhere.</head>
                            <p>There is more excitement piled up for tomorrow than an ordinary crowd can attend to, so a crowd of unusual size, one that can work in sections, is expected, for it is Georgia day, Old Settlers' day and Children's day all in one.</p>
                            <p>For the Georgia end of the occasion there has been prepared a program with a welcome on the part of the exposition by President Gurdon W. Wattles; a response by Henry Richardson, editor of the Atlanta Journal and member of the Georgia commission; a welcome to the press by E. Rosewater; response by H. H. Cabaniss, president of the Georgia Press association, and the address of the day by John Temple Graves of Atlanta.  The Omaha Concert band will respond with several numbers.  This is all to be at the Auditorium at 11 a. m.</p>
                            <p>Old Settlers day has been provided for by a call to the Nebraska Territorial Pioneers' association, ex-Governor Robert W. Furnas of Brownsville, president, and W. R. Bowen of Omaha, secretary, to meet at noon at the Nebraska building.  There an informal festive gathering of the old timers will be held and announcements for entertainment will be made.</p>
                            <p>Children's day will be a hearty welcome to the little folk from everywhere.  Since the railroads did not make general excursion rates for children perhaps there will not be many present except from Omaha, South Omaha, Council Bluffs and the immediate vicinity, save from Blair, where a big party of 1,000 children and their chaperones, in charge of Superintendent of Schools Fowler, will arrive by special train.</p>
                            <p>The mere fact that a general cut rate was not made for the children will be gotten around entirely by fixing other days as Children's days, as other big excursions are gotten up, taking in not only all of the children who can pay their own way, but all of the poor little folk who wouldn't see the great exposition at all were it not that the philanthropic people gather them up and invite them to join, as has been kindly done at Blair.</p>
                            <p>So next Monday will be another Children's day because from Fremont is coming an excursion of at least 800 boys and girls, in charge of Superintendent of Schools Dan Miller, and on October 8 there will be another excursion to pick up the children from Emerson and intermediate stations.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Speculation Regarding the Great Delegation From Chicago.</head>
                            <p>Chicago, Ill., Sept. 28.&#8212;Chairman W. H. Harper of the committee of arrangements for the observance of Chicago day at the Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha, next Saturday, estimates that at least 1,000 citizens of Chicago with their families will participate in the different excursions which will leave here Friday.  Nearly that number of tickets have already been disposed of.  It is expected that the Chicago board of trade special will carry about 120 members and their families.  Between seventy-five and 100 tickets have been given out.  Fully 500 will go on the county democracy train.  The Union League club will send a large delegation of members and their families.</p>
                            <p>Great rivalry exists between the different railroads which are to transport the citizens of Chicago to the exposition as to the <choice><sic>quipment</sic><corr>equipment</corr></choice> of the trains.  The special train of the board of trade will travel over the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul.  It will consist of elegant sleeping cars, dining cars, a baggage car for small baggage and a coach for smoking purposes.</p>
                            <p>This train will reach Omaha at 8 o'clock Saturday morning H. R. McCullough, vice president of the Northwestern, is one of the directors of the Union League club, and in his capacity as a director will be able to give the club the best the road can offer.  According to descriptions this train will be a fine one.  It will consist of two compartment coaches, especially fitted up for this occasion, four sleeping cars, one smoker, two dining and an elegantly furnished observation car.</p>
                            <p>At Omaha the members will live on the train.</p>
                            <p>Friday afternoon the county democracy will leave on a special train over the Burlington road.  Fully 500 marchers will parade the Chicago streets on the way to the depot.  Mayor Harrison will go with this delegation and the club will act as his escort in the parade.  The Omaha Jacksonian club has made arrangements to entertain the club in the best of style and will be assembled there to meet the members on their arrival.</p>
                            <p>Arrangements have been made by the Marquette club for a special train on the Northwestern road to carry about fifty of the members and their families to the exposition.  This train will leave Chicago Friday evening and at Omaha will be entertained at the Millard hotel.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Will Be a Great Day.</head>
                            <p>Chicago day at the exposition will be a hummer, and no mistake.  The famous Cook County Marching club will be here and it comes prepared to have a good time.  The home of this democratic organization is a palatial one at 122 LaSalle street.  John Powers is president and James H. Farrell marshal.  To these two men is the credit largely due for this solid and unique organization, which has done such good work for the party in that city.  Among the prominent men who have had a large share in the club's work are Miles J. Dewine, J. Henry Bunges, James J. Gray, Judge J. Sabath, Judge J. C. Dooley, J. R. Pyne, W. J. O'Brien and R. C. Dunning.  These men are known as the president's cabinet or executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Harrison is one of the leading and active members of the organization.  The club is composed of the best and wealthiest men in the Lake City, and with them money is no object.  Last year they went to Syracuse and Albany on an outing, political, and chartered a $7,000 train.  This gives an idea of the stuff the club is made of.  The club takes one or more trips each year, and these outings are an astonishment to the natives of the places visited.  The club is known as the most active political club in the United States, or in the world for that matter.</p>
                            <p>The club spent seven days in the south during the Atlanta exposition, and the outing was a tremendous success, costing thousands of dollars.  It was also an event in the history of that great southern display.</p>
                            <p>Just how many Chicagoans will come to Omaha Saturday is a problem.  The railroads are finding much trouble in securing sleepers to accommodate the crowd.  It is given out as official that not less than 100 sleeping cars will be required to handle the crowd.</p>
                            <p>Several brass bands and drum corps will accompany the party.  The Chicagoans begin arriving Friday evening, and most of the special trains will have arrived by Saturday morning early.  The delegates will remain until Sunday night or Monday morning.</p>

                            <p>Another breeze sprang up yesterday afternoon just in time to prevent the ascension of the war balloon, the second time this week that such a mishap has occurred.  In the meantime the balloon is proving to be an <choice><sic>unwieldly</sic><corr>unwieldy</corr></choice> customer, having notions of its own about leaking gas and tumbling around with the wind.  Arrangements are being hurried for exhibitions of army signalling by flags, torches, and heliographs at 4 p. m. on the days when it is too breezy for the balloon to soar.</p>
                            <p>All is proceeding quietly at the Indian congress with an impromptu war dance every evening.  The substantial permanent seats for spectators are rapidly nearing completion.  The Genoa Indian school band has gone home, and another Indian band will arrive to take its place.  If not present by Saturday the Omaha Concert band will furnish the music for the contemplated review and sham battle Saturday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>For Denver day, October 20, the Burlington has made the round trip rate of 80 per cent of one fare, making the cost of tickets $13.60 each.</p>
                            <p>Telegrams received by President Wattles from Mr. W. N. Babcock in Washington yesterday are to the effect that President McKinley will for a certainty arrive here on the evening of October 11 and remain during October 12, all as originally planned, despite efforts of St. Louis to the contrary.</p>
                            <p>It is now planned to designate next week as Farmers' week, it being a timely occasion because of the opening of the immense stock show.  The intention is to afford the farmers special facilities for viewing this show.</p>
                            <p>Editorial timber of the best quality will arrive in abundance today from the south and will be welcomed by a committee at the trains if possible, and if not, at their hotels.  Georgia editors to the number of seventy-five will arrive at 11 a. m., going to the Millard.  Southwest Missouri editors, sixty strong, are expected at 5:30 p. m., their headquarters to be at the Mercer.</p>
                            <p>Swedish-Americans and Maccabees together gave the grounds a lively appearance yesterday.  The elaborate program of the Swedes gave way to the lighter amusements of Innes big band concert and the Midway concessions in the evening, ending with a fine display of fireworks by A. L. Due &amp; Co. at 9 o'clock.  The attendance was at the satisfactory figure of 19,464, a total to date of 1,648,435.</p>

                            <p>Today is Library day, in honor of the delegates to the congress, which holds its opening session this evening.  A number of the librarians are putting in the day on the grounds.  They are holding no exercises, but are mingling with the rest of the crowd and modestly gathering all the pointers that bear on their particular line of work.</p>
                            <p>The visitor who came to the White City today to study it as a marvel of architecture and art did so with squinting eyes and through a cloud of dust.  The wind from the south swept across the Court of Honor, rippling the waters of the lagoon into dancing waves, and storming the castles of peace with a fusillade of powdered stone.  Up the Midway from the Transportation building it got a full sweep, and bore down upon the eastern people like some familiar sand storm of the desert.  Sightseers sought the welcome shelter of the buildings.</p>
                            <p>Tomorrow will be a big day.  The Nebraska state pioneers are coming in full force.  They will hold no formal exercises, but will gather on the grounds and discuss the events of the past.  The association of pioneers consists of those who were born in the territory of Nebraska before it became a state or who moved here prior to that time.</p>
                            <p>In addition to being Old Settlers' day tomorrow will be Children's day and Georgia day.  A rate of 15 cents will be made to all children between the ages of 5 and 15 years.  A thousand youngsters are coming from Blair under the charge of H. K. Fowler, superintendent of the Blair public schools.  The railroads have granted concessions in the matter of rates and most of the public schools will give the little ones a holiday.</p>
                            <p>Georgia will send her sons in large numbers tomorrow and the visitors from the sunny south will celebrate the day in true southern style.  The Georgia state building will be their headquarters and the usual exercises will be held in the Auditorium.  In the evening the concert by Innes' band will consist chiefly of war music.  The program will be supplemented by a series of stereopticon views illustrative of the south and more especially of the state of Georgia.  This program will be given on the Plaza at 8 o'clock.</p>

                            <p>Chairman Brigham has called a meeting of the Government Board of Management for October 11, at which all of the members will be present.  There is no great amount of business for consideration, the main object being to arrange for the visit of President McKinley and party at the Government building, as it is known that the chief executive of the nation will call at his own house during his stay in the city.  The members of the Government Board of Management are:  J. H. Brigham, Department of Agriculture, chairman; W. H. Michael, Department of State; C. E. Kemper, Department of State; Major H. C. Ward, War department; Lieutenant E. M. Steadman, Navy department; J. B. Brownlow; Postoffice department; W. V. Cox, National Museum, secretary; W. M. Geddes, disbursing officer; F. W.

                            <p>The reception at which President McKinley will meet the exposition visitors will undoubtedly be held in the rotunda of the Government building.  Prior to this reception he will visit the various departments, accompanied by the chairman of the board.  Upon being introduced to the head of one department, he will be accompanied to the next department by the head that he has previously met, who will leave him there, after which the same course will be pursued until all of the heads of the departments have been called upon.</p>
                            <p>Later in the day and at the time when the exposition visitors are presented to President McKinley, the central portion of the building will be roped off so that the crowd may pass in one door and out of the other, the president shaking hands with each as they pass.  During this ceremony the officers will accompany him and the department heads will stand on either side, as is the usual custom at expositions that the president has visited during the last few years.  President McKinley is a rapid hand shaker and can pass the people along at the rate of almost one per second, giving each a hearty hand grip.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ten Brass Antiquities from Santiago Shown at the Fair.</head>
                            <p>Ten of the brass cannon captured by General Shafter at Santiago have arrived and have been placed upon exhibition at the Government building, where they are attracting considerable attention.  They were hauled in yesterday and from the time they were deposited upon the grounds until the gates closed last night they were surrounded by a crowd of people.</p>
                            <p>The cannon captured at Santiago are antiquated specimens of ancient warfare.  Seven of them are six-inch and the others are four and one-half-inch guns.  Most of them are from 150 to 170 years old and are supposed to have been sent to Cuba soon after being cast.  The guns are long fellows, measuring twelve and sixteen feet from muzzle to breech.  They are all smooth bores and show marks of usage.  The barrels are decorated with the coat-of-arms of Spain and are covered with inscriptions and pictures, engraved.  On top of each gun there is a huge picture of a face, with rays running out in every direction, apparently intending to represent the rays of the sun.  The breech pins are several inches in length and are put into the mouth of a huge head that looks like that of a lion.</p>
                            <p>The guns were on the fortifications at Santiago and were taken off by General Shafter, placed on board of a ship and sent to Montauk Point, after which they were forwarded to this city.  It is doubtful if they were used in the late war, as there is nothing about them to indicate that they have been fired recently.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Remarkable Popularity of the Organization Freely Attested.</head>
                            <p>Innes and his band have quickly leaped into popularity.  Both concerts, that in the Auditorium in the afternoon at 2 o'clock and the Plaza concert in the evening at 7 o'clock, were attended by large crowds.  The artistic excellence to which this organization has been brought under the leadership of its genial director is something quite new in the history of band music.  Yesterday's concerts gave the local musicians an opportunity of hearing for the first time a splendid overture in Litolff's "Les Girondins," which was given by the band with a vigor and delicacy alike indescribable to those who have not yet heard the playing of this splendid organization.  Signor Perfetto's solo on the euphonium demonstrated at once that the advance encomiums preceding this great player were fully deserved.  The "Norwegian Rhapsody," by Lalo, was another novelty which caught the musicians present.  In fact it is in the constant playing of the compositions heretofore separated from organizations of this class in which the supreme value as a drawing attraction of Innes and his players largely consists.  They take people away from the beaten track of the ordinary band and instead of giving them a succession of pieces played by every band in the country, their repertoire goes into the domain of the stringed orchestra, at the same time retaining all those things which are brightest and most exhilarating in that of the concert band.</p>
                            <p>Whether Innes likes trombone playing or not, he must go on.  The audience was in a fever of enthusiasm after he had finished the Wagner aria, "Evening Star."  Nothing would satisfy them but the playing of an additional number which the genial musician reluctantly did.  It was a great hit.</p>
                            <p>Tomorrow night has been set aside for the giving of an exclusively Wagner program.  In special honor of Saturday being Chicago day, Innes has arranged a festival program in which he will introduce for the first time here his famous spectacular anvil scene and a battery of rapid fire electric artillery, which will be used as an accompaniment to the national airs.</p>

                            <p>There were Indian dances at the camp both afternoon and evening yesterday and they were attended by a crowd of goodly proportions.  While there was some change in the name of the dance, the music and the step seemed to be the same and those not up in Indian lore were unable to distinguish the difference between the dances put up yesterday and those seen heretofore.</p>
                            <p>The work of preparation for the reproduction of the tragedy wherein Sitting Bull was murdered goes on in a most satisfactory manner to Captain Mercer.  With a few more rehearsals he is of the opinion that he will be able to give the public an exhibition of just how the old Sioux war chief lost his life.</p>

                            <p>A large number of delegates to the Transmississippi Library congress registered at the public library during the morning and the attendance will be even larger than was expected.  The representation of librarians from the far eastern states is particularly gratifying, a number of them being among the foremost librarians and library experts in the country.  The Iowa Library association also arrived in force to merge its sessions with the congress, with the exception of its business meetings, which will be held separately.</p>
                            <p>A program of short addresses followed by a reception will open the congress tonight at the library building.  The local speakers who will tender a welcome to the delegates are Miss Kate L. McHugh, assistant principal of the High school; Rev. Newton M. Mann and Victor Rosewater.  There will be responses by W. H. Bratt, of the public library, Cleveland, O.; Johnson Brigham, state librarian of Iowa; W. C. Lane, librarian of Harvard university; Miss E. Ahern, editor of Public Libraries, Chicago; H. J. Carr of the public library, Scranton, Pa.; Rutherford B. Hayes, son of ex-President Hayes; Miss Carrie W. Whitney of the public library, Kansas City, Mo.; Senator J. H. Stout of Wisconsin.</p>
                            <p>The program will begin at 8 o'clock and will be followed by a reception to the delegates on the third floor of the building.  Refreshments will be served and the public is invited and assured of a general good time.</p>

                                <l>At Omaha Sept. 29th and 30th, and Oct. 1st, 1898.</l>

                                <p>The Trans-Mississippi Library Congress will be held at Omaha the last week in September, 1898, as one of a series of congresses on educational, religious and economic subjects under the auspices of the Bureau of Education of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.</p>
                                <ab>Plan.</ab>
                                <p>The Library Congress is planned to create interest in library work among the people of the states participating in the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.  It aims to present discussions by prominent library people from all parts of the country upon topics of general interest touching the work of public libraries, their relations to educational institutions and the public, and the general progress of the modern library movement.  The sessions will be held in the lecture room of the Omaha Public Library, Harney and 19th streets.</p>
                                <ab>Exposition.</ab>
                                <p>The great attraction which appeals to people interested in library work to attend this congress is the Trans-Mississippi Exposition now in progress, and which continues open until November 1, 1898.  The Exposition illustrates the resources and material development of the western half of the American continent and affords an opportunity for studying exhibits which, if utilizes, will be of great advantage to every one engaged in or interested in library work.  Thursday, September 29th, will be library day at the Exposition.</p>
                                <ab>Iowa State Association.</ab>
                                <p>The Iowa State Library Association has merged its annual meeting with the Library Congress at Omaha, but may hold separate meetings for transaction of business routine.</p>
                                <ab>Hotels and Railroads.</ab>
                                <p>Special excursion rates are in force on all railroads leading into Omaha.  Library Congress headquarters have been established at the new Iler Grand Hotel, Howard and 16th streets, conveniently located, where special rates will be given.</p>

                            <p>There'll be an exciting time over toward the northwestern part of the exposition grounds, beginning bright and early tomorrow morning, for there and there only is located the finest live stock show of America in 1898.  That big show opens for business Monday morning and lasts till October 20, but it is tomorrow that entries will be received, and from fifty to 100 carloads of stock will arrive during the day in time to be placed, fed and brightened up as a dollar by opening hour Monday.</p>
                            <p>Work has been going on night and day to finish the fifty-one big barns, painting them a rich red, building pavilions, amphitheater and store houses, grading a fine show ring, leading water pipes and electric light wires to every barn and getting all in spick and span shape for receiving early arrivals tomorrow.  For five days exhibitors have urged permissions to send in their stock at once, but they have been held back till all is in good shape.</p>
                            <p>Tomorrow's arrivals will be but the beginning, however, for all day Sunday and Monday other arrivals are coming till at least 800 cattle, 1,000 swine, 500 sheep and 250 horses are found in their pens or stalls.</p>
                            <p>Among the first to come will be some imported Herefords from the herd of George H. Adams, Creston, Colo., one heifer alone costing $2,000 before half grown.</p>
                            <p>The catalogue, one of the largest of the kind ever published, has gone to press and will be out early next week.</p>
                            <p>All of the poultry from the International poultry show leaves today to make more room for the stock show.</p>
                            <p>In special recognition of those most interested in the show, next week has been designated as Farmers' week, and farmers throughout the country are cordially invited to avail themselves of the special opportunities and courtesies afforded to view the great displays.</p>
                            <p>The one beauty of the whole show is that no one in charge has to worry a moment as to whether or not it will be a financial success or need be afraid of spending a dollar where it will do any good, for in a big stone bank down town was one week ago deposited every dollar of the prize money, subject to the order of the live stock show October 20.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Distinguished Party From the Sunny South Arrives.</head>
                            <p>The special Georgia train was two hours late in arriving yesterday, getting in at 3:30 in the afternoon.  The editors were in charge of John Triplett, editor of the Thomasville Times-Enterprise.  There were 100 people in the party, three-fourths of whom were editors.  The Georgia editors met in Atlanta September 27, starting that afternoon for Omaha.  They will be in the city two or three days, then taking a western trip.  The editors will meet this morning at the Millard at 9 o'clock sharp for the purpose of arranging their plans, after which they will start in a body for the exposition.  Ex-Governor Northen asks that the people from Georgia meet at the state building, exposition, at 10:30 a. m. sharp.  After some little visiting and arranging of the program the party will march to the Auditorium, where the exercises will take place.</p>
                            <p>In addition to those who came on the special train, a number of parties were brought on different routes and will get here today.  Governor Northen said that he had made an effort to have the exercises at 2 p. m. instead of at 11 a. m., but had been unable to make the change, and the exercises would have to go ahead, even if all the people were not present.  Very few of the state officials are here.  A telegram from Governor Atkinson announces his illness.  He says he expected to come up to the last moment, but is unable to do so.  Several leading men of the state are expected today.  Most of the editors are accompanied by their wives and other members of their families.  Mrs. Northen and Miss Annie Northen, wife and daughter of Governor Northen, accompanied the party.  They will spend some time in the city.</p>
                            <p>Among the leading editors in the party are B. F. Bennett and Mrs. W. H. Hogue, Sunny South, Atlanta; Colonel J. H. Estill and wife, News, Savannah; Colonel John Triplett, Times-Enterprise, Thomasville; F. H. Richardson and John Temple Graves, Journal, Atlanta; J. C. Sawtell, Call, Griffin; Ben Neal Thornton, Atlanta Constitution, and a number of others of prominence.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Prominent Buckeyes Headed by Governor Bushnell and Stuff.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Hiram M. Green of the Ohio state commission returned yesterday from Lincoln, where he went to call on the state officers.  With reference to Ohio day, he stated last evening that Governor A. S. Bushnell would be here October 4, accompanied by Mrs. Bushnell and the following members of his staff: Major General H. B. Kingsley of Columbus, adjutant general; Brigadier General W. P. Orr of Piqua, quartermaster general; Brigadier General J. E. Lowes of Dayton, surgeon general; Colonel D. L. Cockley of Shelby, Colonel C. B. Wing, wife, daughter and Miss Timms of Cincinnati, Colonel C. R. Frisbee of Wilmington, Colonel Julius Fleischmann and wife of Cincinnati, Colonel R. C. McKinney and wife of Hamilton, Colonel Albert Brewer and wife of Tiffin.</p>
                            <p>The Ohio centennial commission of Toledo, having the 1903 celebration in charge, will also be here.</p>
                            <p>Senator Berien of Bucyrus, a member of the state commission, came in Wednesday evening and will remain until after the peace jubilee.  It is expected that all of the commission will be here, with the exception of Mr. Mason, and that the governor will remain until after the jubilee if his plans to visit Yellowstone park can be postponed until that time.</p>
                            <p>It is a strong combination that is coming next Wednesday, Ohio day and Pennsylvania day in one.  At 11 a. m. the Ohio day exercises will take place on the grand plaza, including an address of welcome by Governor Holcomb; response by Governor Bushnell of Ohio; an address on behalf of the exposition by Hon. Johns L. Webster, and an address for Ohio by Colonel Kilbourne, president of the coming Ohio centennial celebration.</p>
                            <p>The Pennsylvania will be led by an official party of thirty or more, perhaps not headed by the governor, but including Charles Emory Smith, postmaster general.  At 2:30 p. m., in the Auditorium, President Wattles will welcome them to the exposition, to which response will be made by Hon. John W. Woodside, president of the Pennsylvania commission.  Then the address of the occasion will be delivered by Charles Emory Smith.</p>

                            <p>Commander Llewellyn of the exposition guards will add five men to the force this morning, which brings the number up to 240.  The increase is necessary on account of the greater crowds of the last month and the fact that the twelve metropolitan policemen on the grounds, save the jailer, will be taken down town tomorrow.  Forty of the guards, those on the Midway and at other places where police power is necessary, will be sworn in as special policemen at once.</p>
                            <p>During the last two weeks Commander Llewellyn has added half a dozen members of the Second Nebraska volunteers out on furlough to the guards.</p>
                            <p>For a few hours yesterday a south hot wind made things somewhat uncomfortable about the exposition, as it did everywhere else, but in the evening a cool breeze from the north caused everyone to feel refreshed and happy.  Every day this week has enjoyed a larger crowd than the day before, so the 20,388 visitors of yesterday had a most delightful time.  The attendance to date has been 1,668,833.</p>

                            <p>Knowing full well that he who hustleth for news at the exposition groweth aweary and faint of hunger, Colonel R. W. Richardson, press commissioner, took pity and observed the time-honored editorial custom of inviting the neighbors to send in something to eat.  The generous responses from neighborly exhibitors were taken to the Woman's building, where Nellie Dot Ranche, instructor of practical cookery, was invited to prepare the delicious repast.  Here at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon Miss Ranche served the delightful luncheon, a dream of paradise to him who lives the uncertain life of the free lunch counter and chases to banquets at the hour when the eating and drinking has finished and the speechifying has begun.</p>
                            <p>The occasion was honored by the presence of Major Clarkson, general manager of the exposition, and Rutherford P. Hayes, son of ex-President Hayes, in attendance at the library congress.  There were present Colonel R. W. Richardson, W. D. Percival, G. C. Porter, F. W. Taylor, Craig McQuaid and A. D. Fetterman.</p>

The program, so far as known, includes addresses of welcome by Mayor Moores and President Wattles of the exposition; a response by Hon. Carter H. Harrison, mayor of Chicago; and addresses by Senator William E. Mason, Congressman J. R. Mann and Hon. Charles G. Dawes, comptroller of the currency.  There will be music in abundance.  Of course, the whole exposition will be at its best during the day, and in the evening the Innes band will give a special program on the grand plaza and the fireworks on the north tract will include the great spectacular event, "The Burning of Chicago."</p>

                            <p>It was just cool enough last evening to make the Indians feel as chipper as birds, and they evinced their good feelings by joining in a lively and athletic Omaha dance, one of the kind that is being given each night this week.  By Saturday there will be a newly built grand stand with a seating capacity of 3,000, for then comes another big sham battle for the benefit of the visiting Chicagoans.</p>
                            <p>Promoters of the National Flax, Hemp and Ramie association were receiving inspiration yesterday from George Loppens, a Belgian expert in flax culture for the fiber, who has been putting his theories into practice with great success in Oregon for the last seven years.

                            <head type="sub">State Tent and State Hive Meet&#8212;Election of Officers.</head>
                            <p>The biennial Nebraska state tent of the Maccabees was in session yesterday at Labor temple.  There are eighty-two tents in the state, fifty of which are represented, and all are enthusiastic at the prospects of the order in this state.  It has grown in membership from 765 since January 1, 1894, to 2,093 on January 1, 1898.</p>
                            <p>State Commander W. W. Hubbard of Omaha, presided.  These officers were elected:</p>
                            <p>A. Dewitt, Grand Island, past commander; F. M. Flansburg, Trenton, lieutenant commander; W. H. Smith, Omaha, record keeper; J. C. Hudson, Omaha, chaplain; W. K. Longhridge, Pleasant Dale, sergeant; D. L. Disher, Dorchester, master-at-arms; Peter Jacobs, Hooper, finance keeper; E. A. Andrews, Omaha, S. R. McFarland, Norfolk, first and second master guards; H. D. Reed, Blair, sentinel; H. D. Osborne, Beatrice, picket.</p>
                            <p>The members of the supreme lodge who are in attendance are: N. S. Boynton, supreme record keeper, Port Huron, Mich.; R. E. Moss, supreme medical examiner, Port Huron, Mich.; F. W. Stevens, supreme secretary and editor of the Bee Hive, Port Huron, Mich.</p>
                            <p>The principal address of the convention was delivered by Supreme Record Keeper N. S. Boynton and was listened to attentively.  Mr. Boynton is an ex-mayor of Port Huron, and known widely as one of the originators of the congress of benevolent secret societies.</p>
                            <p>At 12:30 o'clock the Lady Maccabees visited the Maccabee convention in a body and listened to the address of Mr. Boynton.</p>
                            <p>At the afternoon session the reports of the treasurer and secretary of the state tent were taken up, and after examination, reported favorably upon.</p>
                            <p>When it came to the selection of two representatives to the supreme tent, which meets in Port Huron, Mich., the second Tuesday in July, next year, a lively time ensued.  On the first ballot there were six candidates.  Each had a strong following, and for nearly two hours voting continued.  Finally the matter was settled and W. A. Hammond of Lexington and H. H. Reed of Blair elected.</p>
                            <p>At the close of the session most of the delegates left for their homes.  The members of the supreme tent went from here to Minneapolis to attend a state meeting of the Maccabees.</p>

                            <p>The first annual state convention of the supreme Order of the Ladies of the Maccabees met yesterday at Myrtle hall, Continental block, with several score representatives from about fifteen Nebraska hives present and visiting representatives from Iowa, Kansas and Missouri hives.  Besides the election of supreme officers the selection of a delegate to the supreme hive review to be held at Port Huron, July, 1899, and the adoption of a constitution and bylaws was the business transacted.</p>
                            <p>In the afternoon a school of instruction was given by the Omaha hives.</p>
                            <p>This organization was instituted as an adjunct to the Order of Maccabees, April, 1897, and has for its object life protection for its members and promotion of the interest and welfare of the Order of Maccabees.</p>
                            <p>Among the delegates present were: Pink Jones, Pride of Nebraska, North Platte; Susanna Stevens, inland treasurer, Grand Island; Christina A. Bently, Lincoln; Addie B. Palmer, Gate City, Omaha; Eloise Hatchen, Wastell, Grand Island; Laura M. Reid, No. 15, South Omaha; Agnes B. Brown, Arbor, Arborville; Ella Reed, Blair; Anna Crawford, Laurel, Omaha; Mary Ladd, Mizpah, Albion; Sarah J. Davis, Lady Hollister, Omaha; Fannie L. Wilson, Lexington; Mary E. Emery, Otoe.</p>
                            <p>Lillian M. Hollister, supreme commander of the Ladies of the Maccabees, at the Thursday afternoon session appointed Mrs. Julia A. Sheely of Gate City hive No. 9, state commander, the state hive selected Mrs. L. M. Bouk of Gate City hive as representative to the supreme hive review and Mrs. Susanna Stevens of Grand Island as alternate.</p>
                            <p>The ritual work of the order was exemplified by a picked team from the Omaha hives in a manner very pleasing to the visiting representatives.  Speeches were made by the supreme officers and others.  The next session will be held subject to the call of the supreme commander.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THE EXPOSITION IN '99.</head>
                            <p>The proposition to re-open the Trans-Mississippi exposition in 1899 is meeting with universal favor.  Several metropolitan exchanges have referred to the matter and express the opinion that such a move would result beneficially to the west and prove even more successful financially and otherwise than the exposition of 1898.  A number of trans-Mississippi states that failed to provide for representation at the exposition this year would quickly seize the opportunity to be represented at the exposition next year.  This is especially true of Missouri.  Two years before the exposition opened the Missouri legislature considered the matter of making an appropriation for the exposition, but the time was so far ahead that little interest was manifested.  Missouri, like other states, did not believe that Omaha could carry out such an enormous plan.  There was no session of the Missouri legislature last winter, so no appropriation could be made.  All attempts to raise money failed because of the war excitement, and Missouri, one of the richest and best states in the union, is not represented at the exposition.  If the exposition is continued next year Missouri will be represented as becomes her, and the same is true of other states that are not now represented.</p>
                            <p>The success of the exposition has astonished the country.  Many states not now represented are regretting their failure in this respect and are anxious to redeem that mistake.  The exposition can be made greater in every way next year than it has been this year, and its success this year has been little short of marvelous, despite adverse conditions.</p>
                            <p>Omaha in 1899!  Let that be the rallying cry.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">A WILD SCHEME.</hi></head>
                            <p>The proposition to extend the exposition another year is being agitated by parties who have not given the subject even casual consideration.  These people do not seem to comprehend what such a scheme involves and what obstacles would have to be overcome.</p>
                            <p>To extend the exposition would require legislation by congress to retain the United States government exhibit and a congressional appropriation to pay the expenses of its maintenance and inevitable repairs of the government building.  It would require state legislation and state aid not only from those states which have not made exposition appropriations, but also from those states which have made liberal appropriations for state buildings and exhibits.  It would involve additional subsidies from city and county and necessitate an outlay of at least $100,000 for maintenance and reconstruction of grounds and buildings.</p>
                            <p>In addition to all this new ground leases would have to be obtained or purchases made of ground whose use cannot be otherwise secured.  A serious problem would arise in the matter of insurance on buildings which, as is well known, terminates with the end of this year's exposition season.  Then would come the question of readjusting concession contracts and retaining exhibits under new conditions, as well as keeping up the costly power plant, part of which is only leased.</p>
                            <p>In any event any discussion or speculation on this score is out of place at this time, even if the scheme were feasible.  Its tendency is to keep people away from the exposition under the delusive idea that they will be able to see the show next year, when the chances are as 99 to 1 that another opportunity to view this great exposition will never again be presented.</p>

The old settlers are gathering in little knots and talking over the past, recounting stories of the day when the wolves were howling about the bluffs where now stand the buildings of the exposition.  The little ones are running here and there finding a new pleasure in every turn,  But the Georgians are now making their presence felt the most.  They have come with a blare of national music and a blast of souther oratory.  They met in the Georgia building at 10 o'clock and marched in a body to the Auditorium escorted by the Oma<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Governor Northen presided at the Auditorium.  In opening the exercises he said that the Transmississippi Exposition marks an epoch in national existence, a triumph of peace and an evidence of the wonderful progress of the great west and northwest.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles, on behalf of the exposition, delivered the address of welcome.  He said that in the days of doubt and gloom, when the rumblings of war were heard in the land, Georgia came forward and promised to erect a building and furnish an exhibit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Feels Good to Be Here.</head>
                            <p>Hon. Henry Richardson of Atlanta, editor of the Atlanta Journal, was the next speaker.  He said in part:</p>
                            <p>I am delighted to be here.  Only once was I ashamed to be in a place, and that was when I walked through the avenues of the Columbia exposition and found that my state was voiceless.  Today when I stood in the Georgia building, not far from here, and heard the band play our national airs, and that other tune we love, "Dixie," I felt that I was in my father's house and my mother's arms were around me.  I do not want to brag on Georgia.  But she has the greatest variety of mineral resources of any state in the union.  The clays of Georgia in the hands of skilled labor will make Dresden china.  You think you are in the agricultural garden spot of the world.  It is a prophecy that Georgia will equal you on corn.  You talk about hay.  I glory in hay.  A mule will turn from your hay to eat Georgia hay in a minute.  And I would rather take the criticism of a mule on hay than all the experts in the world.  You can raise wheat in Georgia, and cane if you want to.  We love Georgia, but we are captivated now with your wonderful exposition.  We love her for her men, her women and her traditions.  We honor names and teach our children to honor men <choice><sic>whereever</sic><corr>wherever</corr></choice> they spring from.  I have seen my city riddled with federal shells, but now when you look to the sky you will see thousands of American flags fluttering in the breeze.</p>
                            <p>Hon. Edward Rosewater was the next speaker.  He said in part:</p>
                            <p>A great many years ago I lived within fifty miles of the Georgia line.  Georgia was then recognized as the empire state and since then I have had abundance of additional evidences.  I feel that Georgia has entered upon a wonderful era.  She is destined to rival the states of New England in manufactures.  Georgia gave the initial momentum to the reconciliation of the north and the south.  It is the Georgia press that has brought about the patriotic feeling that now pervades the state.  We understand the influences of the press for good and evil, but it has been due to the press&#8212;and that alone&#8212;that states have officially participated in this exposition.</p>
                            <p>You came a distance of 1,500 miles with the conviction that the seed sown here will yield results.  Georgia is practically the only state that has come with a first class exhibit.</p>
                            <p>When I called on Thomas B. Reed, asking if congress would appropriate $300,000 for our exposition, he asked me if as a business proposition it would be wise to make the expenditure when the government was running behind nearly $8,000,000 a month.  But congress made the appropriation.</p>
                            <p>The collection of palaces a year ago last May was a prairie, a corn field.  I feel complimented on the words that you of Georgia have bestowed upon the management.</p>

                            <head type="sub">On Behalf of the Press.</head>
                            <p>Hon. John Triplett of Thomasville, Ga., editor of the Thomasville Times-Enterprise, made a few remarks and introduced Colonel J. H. Estelle of Savannah, Ga., who spoke on behalf of the Georgia press.  He said in part:</p>
                            <p>It is due to the press of Georgia that it has the government that it has today.  Don't flatter yourself that our excursion will stop here.  We shall go to the end of the railroad.  We make these trips every year.  We have been from Canada to Mexico, and from California to Maine.  Next year, when things are a little more peaceable down there, we shall go to Porto Rico, and the following year, if transportation doesn't cost too much, we shall visit the Paris exposition.</p>
                            <p>Following the talk of Colonel Estelle, the band played "My Old Kentucky Home."</p>
                            <p>The last speaker of the morning was John Temple Graves, who spoke for the state of Georgia, saying:</p>
                            <p>With all due respect to those who have preceded me, I am inclined to think that the best speech for Georgia has been made by the president of this exposition.  Let me say that the city from which I come is the pioneer of all audacity in international expositions.  So no people know better how to appreciate the forces that have been marshaled in this stupendous achievement.  The great expositions of the world are the great peacemakers of the world.  The war that has just ended has brought to us one great shining promise.  The Nicaraguan canal is just as inevitably the outcome as the banishment of the Spaniards from the western seas.  In that great day the south from which I come will be the geographical and natural center of the commerce of the world.  We shall then be ready.</p>
                            <p>The speaker then grew eloquent on the subject of the new south and the relations existing between his countrymen and their northern brothers.  Firm and forceful, he piled word on word, sentence on sentence and climax on climax until bursting into a flood of eloquence he lifted his hearers to their feet shouting and cheering for the orator of the Cracker state.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Some of the Formalities that Will Be Observed During Chicago Day.</head>
                            <p>Major Hambleton of the Illinois building is continually receiving advices indicating that Chicago day is to be one of the big features of the exposition.  As everybody knows, it will be observed Saturday and the exercises will be participated in by Chicago marching clubs, trade organizations and citizen generally.  Most of the trains bearing the visitors will arrive tonight, though it is possible that some of them will not get in until this morning.</p>
                            <p>While it is not the intention to have a big parade, Major Hambleton says there will be something of the kind.  It will form at Fourteenth and Farnam streets at about 10 o'clock, where carriages will be in readiness to carry the speakers and many of the guests to the Sherman avenue entrance of the grounds.  Arriving there the carriages will be dismissed and everybody will proceed to the Auditorium, where the exercises will be held at 11 o'clock, E. S. Conway, first vice president of the Illinois commission, presiding.  The exercises will be opened by prayer, after which President Wattles of the exposition will deliver the address of welcome.  He will be followed by Mayor Harrison of Chicago, who will speak upon the subject "Chicago."  After this Mayor Moores will tender the visitors the freedom of the city and will turn over to Mayor Harrison the golden keys of this municipality.</p>
                            <p>The formal part of the program having been disposed of there will be a season of oratory, during which Senator Mason, Comptroller Dawes, Congressman Mann and other Chicago orators will occupy the time.  During the intervals between the speeches the Twenty-second infantry band of Fort Crook will render some of its finest selections.  After the speaking and during the afternoon the visitors will enjoy themselves about the grounds, it being expected that many of them will remain at the Illinois building to meet the residents of this city, who are expected to call.  During the evening a mandolin orchestra will furnish the music at the state building.  From 8:30 until 11 o'clock there will be a reception, at which light refreshments will be served.  To this reception Major and Mrs. Hambleton invite all of the Omaha people and those of other cities and states now here and connected with the exposition.  For this occasion the parlors of the Illinois building have been tastily decorated under the direction of Mrs. Hambleton, until they have a very rich as well as homelike appearance.  Pictures of Lincoln, Grant and McKinley have been hung upon the walls.  Rugs have been laid over the rich carpets and oiled floors, while cut flowers and potted plants have been placed upon the tables, in the niches and corners of the rooms.  The front of the building has been decorated with flags, giving it a most patriotic appearance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Innes Will Produce His Wagnerian Program on the Plaza.</head>
                            <p>Innes had another big matinee yesterday and the biggest audience for a night without some unusual big special feature since the exposition opened.  The programs were of the usually high class order and the scenes of the four previous days were re-enacted.  Unstinted praise followed almost every number.</p>
                            <p>The Wagnerian festival for tonight is worth more than a passing word.  It is a wonderful undertaking for a band of brass and reed, but there is every assurance that Innes will do it full justice.  His masterful handling of Wagner's greatest overture, "Tannhaeuser," last Tuesday night sets all doubts at rest about the result.  Friday night of each week was known as "Wagnerian night" at Innes' Philadelphia concerts summer before last, and at his Nashville exposition concerts last summer and they were decidedly society events.  The smart set used to be out in force and what are called "pretty audiences" were a rule.  But the recognition of Philadelphia and New York, which have the most whimsical critics on earth, was not needed, and as a matter of fact it was late in coming to establish the fact that a band of wind instruments had come before the public with Wagner's complete repertory and played it so as to owe no apology to that master.  Innes had done it on the road for three years before the good people of Philadelphia and New York had an opportunity to hear and pass judgment.  So it was a little amusing to read an extract from a little paper published in a Philadelphia suburb chiding Innes for not coming back there this fall instead of coquetting with the western public at the Transmississippi Exposition, and adding that it was Philadelphia who discovered Innes.  The metropolitan press of Philadelphia was good enough to give Innes full credit for his work without requiring him to acknowledge that he was never born until he got there.</p>
                            <p>It is a matter of fact that Innes' band is the oldest one of the first rank on the road.  He organized it just eleven years ago and he was doing a successful concert business before any other well known bandmaster had begun, though it was not until four years ago that he introduced those innovations which have unquestionably ushered in a new era of band music.</p>
                            <p>In consequence of the tremendous demand upon the electrical department of the exposition in connection with the preparations necessary for Chicago day, it has been decided to postpone until some day next week the giving of the spectacular anvil scene and electrical cannon accompaniment announced for Saturday night.  A carefully prepared program has been arranged for Sunday afternoon and night, which will be laid out upon the same lines which governed the formation of last Sunday's program, which met the universal commendation of churchgoer and layman.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent of Music Kelly is receiving numberless applications regarding the makeup of Monday night's request program.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SHAM BATTLE FOR SATURDAY.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Captain Mercer Will Pull Off Another of His Now Famous Affairs.</head>
                            <p>Captain Mercer has lined his Indians up and will have them give a sham battle at 4:30 o'clock Saturday afternoon for the amusement and entertainment of the numerous visitors who will be in the city at that time.  The battle will be fought along substantially the same lines as those which have been seen upon former occasions, though there will be an interesting side feature thrown in.  There will be a scalping act, which will be performed according to the latest and most approved style.  Of course a scalp will not be really pulled off, but to all intents and purposes it will suffice.</p>
                            <p>On this occasion the Sioux and their allies will be camped out in the east end of the lot, while the Blackfeet and their cohorts will hold the position down in the trees near the west line of the grounds.  A Sioux Indian, Grass, who has been captured and burned at the stake so many times in the mimic warfare that he enjoys it, will be brought and tied to a pole and a slow fire kindled about him.  About this time some of Goes-to-War's braves will discover that things are being made warm for Grass and will rush off and tell the Sioux how things are going.  Goes-to-War will listen, as he is regarded the best listener on the grounds, and then he will rally his men and ride down upon the enemy, shooting and clubbing Indians, both young and old.  He will release Grass and will tie a couple of Blackfeet to the same pole and will proceed to fry them over the same fire that was intended for his man.  About the time when the heat begins to grow uncomfortable for the Indians their comrades, reinforced, will do battle with the Sioux and will drive them off, killing scores of them.  This will end the contest and after it is all over there will be a peace jubilee on a small scale, the Indians repairing to their tents and forgiving the sins of all of their enemies.</p>

                            <p>Secretary Greene of the Ohio State Exposition commission has advices from his home indicating that there will be many Ohioans here to participate in the exercises of Ohio day, October 5.  A letter from Columbus brings the information that Governor Bushnell and the members of his staff, together with their wives, will be in attendance.  The members of the staff are:  Major General Herbert B. Kinsley, Brigadier General W. P. Orr, Brigadier General Joseph E. Lowes, Colonels D. L. Cockley, Charles B. Wing, Julius Fleischmann, Robert C. McKinney and Albert Brewer.  The party will leave Columbus on October 3, reaching Omaha the following day.  A special train will convey the members of the governor's party.</p>
                            <p>A special train will leave Toledo, O., October 3, reaching here the following day.  The train will bring the Toledo Centennial commission, the Toledo Chamber of Commerce and such other visitors as may desire to come to Omaha.  Secretary Greene is of the opinion that the observance of Ohio day will bring in several hundred residents of the Buckeye state, most of whom will remain during the week.  The secretary returned from Lincoln yesterday and while there he called upon Governor Holcomb.  The governor told him he would be here on Ohio day and would take part in the exercises.</p>
                            <p>The Ohio exercises will be opened by an address of welcome by Governor Holcomb of Nebraska, to which Governor Bushnell of Ohio will respond.  The address on behalf of the exposition will be delivered by John L. Webster.  This will be followed by

                            an address by Colonel Kilbourn, president of the Ohio Centennial commission.  Music will be furnished by the Toledo Marine band, which will accompany the Ohioans on their trip.</p>
                            <p>The Pennsylvania exercises will include an address of welcome by President Wattles on behalf of the exposition, followed by a response by Hon. J. W. Woodside, president of the Pennsylvania commission.  The oration of the day will be delivered by Charles Emory Smith, postmaster general of the United States, who will also speak on President's day.  He will occupy the rostrum for fifty minutes and will in a measure speak for the present administration.  It is expected that his address will be published in most of the newspapers throughout the United States.</p>

The animals will not be brought into the ring until next Thursday, but the exhibition will be open for the inspection of the public on Monday.  By that time all the entries will be in except those which have been delayed at the various fairs.  A great many of the exhibitors now have their stock at Springfield.

It was the intention to send the balloon up, but none of the men connected with the signal service cared to risk their lives off the earth in a wind blowing along at the rate of twenty-five miles per hour.  If the conditions are favorable this afternoon an attempt will be made to send the balloon out on an exhibition trip.</p>

They were peeled down to the skin, which was painted all of the colors of the rainbow.  The paint glistened and sparkled in the rays of the electric light and the dancers set a pace that would have been hard for any paleface to have followed.  The dance was designated as an Omaha function and was participated in by about 100 of the braves.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Men Who Have Labored Years in the Profession Compliment Omaha on Its Magnificent Library and Pay Tribute to Exposition.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Library congress was opened most auspiciously at an informal session held at the Omaha public library last evening.  A meeting of about an hour in the lecture room of the library was followed by a delightful social in the spacious rooms on the third floor.  Distinguished librarians from other cities and a number of leading citizens of Omaha became quite well acquainted and a season of friendly intercourse was followed by the serving of refreshments.</p>
                            <p>The lecture room was well filled when Dr. Victor Rosewater, chairman of the local committee on arrangements, called the meeting to order and after a brief address of welcome to the visiting librarians and an invitation to all to attend the sessions of the congress, introduced W. H. Brett of Cleveland, O.  The latter paid a high compliment to the Omaha public library, especially praising the city on its library building and the admirable arrangement of it.  He spoke of the good results bound to be achieved from an excellent library so well housed.</p>
                            <p>Captain W. H. Johnston of Fort Dodge, Ia., and president of the Iowa Library association, followed, speaking of the growth of the library idea.  He said the library microbe was getting very numerous and nowhere more so than in Iowa.  He expressed his pleasure at seeing so many of the big library microbes present and anticipated much pleasure and profit from the meetings of the congress.</p>

                            <head type="sub">From America's Oldest Library.</head>
                            <p>President Lane of the American Library association, also librarian at Cambridge, was introduced as one of the biggest library microbes present.  Among other things he said:  "The library microbe struck me just before I left college and it has been working in me ever since.  I do not know that the Massachusetts variety is different from any other; it's all very good.  I am glad to bring to the librarians of the transmississippi region of our country the greetings of the oldest library in the United States.  It was founded at Cambridge in 1638 and is in a flourishing condition.  I also take pleasure in presenting the greetings of the American Library association.  This association is well represented all over the United States.  It has held its meetings from the islands off New Hampshire to California, in the north and in the south.  Next year we meet at Atlanta and expect a good attendance from this part of the country.  At some later date we hope to come out to Iowa.  There is one thing that impressed me while looking over the program arranged for this conference.  Nearly all of the subjects on the program concern the new developments of library work.  They are subjects not considered when our association was first formed.  All of the subjects are library subjects and if anyone asks us any questions while we are here our reply will always be 'Libraries, libraries.'"</p>
                            <p>Henry J. Carr, librarian public library at Scranton, Pa., and secretary of the American Library association, was presented as a representative of the Keystone state and a former resident of the transmississippi section of the country.  He said, in part:  "Several months ago some one pinned on my coat lapel this pretty exposition button.  I had then no hope of seeing the exposition.  But later I began to receive letters urging me to attend this congress, and I'm glad I came.  You have a great exposition and a fine library.  I know that the congress will be a great success."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Outgrowth of Education.</head>
                            <p>Chairman Rosewater introduced Superintendent Pearse of the Omaha schools as the representative of a profession very closely connected with that of the librarians.  Mr. Pearse responded in a short but most felicitous speech, saying, among other things:  "Fifty years ago a meeting of librarians and school superintendents would have been impossible.  The one class then no more existed than the other.  Both professions have been developed within recent years.  The librarian is the outgrowth of the book worm.  The school superintendent is the outgrowth of the schoolmaster.  Both are the outgrowth of the same movement&#8212;a public interest in educational affairs.  Both formerly existed only in the home.  The children were taught by the fireside and for many years later the home library contained nearly all the books the family could <unclear reason="torn"/> the schools cannot but notice the improvement among the pupils as the libraries improve.  The boys read better books as better books are placed about them.  The school appreciates the help of the library and the good the boys and girls derive from reading there for research and for recreation.  So far as I have been able to observe here is a case where the supply creates the demand.  The more good books that are placed about the scholars the more of such works will they read."</p>
                            <p>Miss M. E. Ahern, editor of Public Libraries at Chicago, responded to a call.  She paid a tribute to the memory of Miss Jessie Allen, former librarian here, with whom she had been associated.  She complimented Omaha on its fine library and said she had watched the growth of the system here with much interest.  She also said that the exposition compared most favorably with the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>Rev. Newton Mann, introduced as one of the most appreciative patrons of the Omaha Public library, said he was very fond of a good library and he could not possibly live in a city where a good public library was not maintained.  He praised the librarians and said it would be impossible to find a more faithful, a more intelligent or a more patient class of workers.  He confessed jokingly that it was often a question with him whether he went to the library to read the books or to see the fair attendants there.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Development of the System.</head>
                            <p>Rutherford P. Hayes, a former member of the Ohio Library commission, spoke a few good words for the exposition.  He said it was all right so far as he had inspected it and he had not seen all the shows along the Midway.  He said he was greatly interested in library work, having spent fifteen years on a state board.  He was one of those life trustees, few of whom die and none resign.  He said that during recent years many valuable developments of the public library system had been worked out, notably the sending out of pictures, more attention to children's reading, women's club work and traveling libraries.  The latter he cordially endorsed for the west and said the questions relating to the subject would be among the most interesting considered at the congress.</p>
                            <p>After the meeting the visitors were received on the floor above by a numerous reception committee, which included the directors of the Omaha library, Mrs. W. W. Keysor, Miss Edith Tobitt, Mrs. J. H. McIntosh, Miss Kate McHugh, Miss Margaret O'Brien and members of the local library staff.  There were about 200 people in attendance.  They spent an hour or more in viewing with manifest interest the art display and the exhibit of rare books and illustrations of practical library work.  An orchestra played charming music throughout the evening and the refreshments concluded a pleasant program.</p>
                            <p>The first regular session will be held at the Public library, Harney and Nineteenth streets, this morning at 9 o'clock.  The two principal subjects for consideration are:  "Library Legislation and Library Commissions" and "Library Extension."  The next session will be this evening at 8 o'clock.  The public is invited to attend these meetings, which promise to be most interesting and instructive.</p>

                            <p>An interesting feature of this morning's meeting of the Transmississippi Library congress was the unexpected visit of Archbishop Ireland of the Catholic church and admirable address from him to the librarians.  Archbishop Ireland is here from St. Paul for a few days and with Bishop Scannell paid a call to the librarians and was most cordially received by them.</p>
                            <p>He replied briefly to Chairman Brett's invitation to speak and enthusiastically praised the work of the public libraries in America as it is carried on today.  Among other things he said:  "This nation today is congratulating itself on the victories in war and right well may the people of this country and feel proud of the marvellous achievements of our army and navy.  Back of these magnificent victories there was something more than great battleships and splendid armament, and even more than wise leaders and brave commanders.  It was the superiority of the mind of the common soldier and of the ordinary sailor.  The superiority of the American soldier and sailor is due in a great measure to the popularity of education.  He has a greater mind, he knows more and can think more than his rivals.  In this popular education that is doing so much for our nation in times of peace, as well as in time of war, the libraries do more than our schools.  What we want today is to continue the popular education beyond the school.  This further education of our men and women largely rests with the libraries and with the librarians.  So I say this morning that I feel honored at meeting with a set of men and women who are doing so much good for their country.  I bow before you in respect to your grand work that is going on <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>"Intelligence is the great power of the world today.  But something is needed to use intelligence well.  This is moral education.  Libraries have the effect of strengthening the morality of the public, and for this reason your work is to be endorsed.  To be sure books may be misused.  One of God's greatest gifts to us is the art of printing, but printing has been used to instill poison into the minds of young and old.  So there is the proper use and the improper use of books.  You must help your readers to discriminate, and in this you are working for the greater, grander civilization of the American people."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Regular Session Work.</head>
                            <p>The regular program of the morning's session was opened by Rutherford P. Hayes, formerly a member of the Ohio Library commission and now of Chicago.  He read an admirable address on "Library Legislation and Library Commissions."  In brief it explained the Ohio state library law and its workings.  D. A. Campbell, state librarian of Nebraska, from Lincoln, participated in the discussion that followed, and spoke of his experiences in this state, where the library has had to contend with scant support by the commonwealth.</p>
                            <p>Under the head of library extension the theme of traveling libraries received much consideration.  F. A. Hutchins of Madison, Wis., secretary of the Wisconsin Free Library commission, delivered a thoughtful address on the workings and beneficial results of the traveling library in the Badger state.  Among other things he said:  "While the people of our cities are to be provided with books through the medium of our metropolitan libraries it is also important that we have regard to the reading of our rural population.  It is more difficult to secure a competent library county committee in the country because the people in the rural districts do not as a rule know how to select books.  A common fault with the country libraries is that not enough fresh books are secured to keep up the interest.  The traveling library is the great boon to the country districts.  In the traveling libraries the selection of books is in more competent hands.  Books are collected every six months and sent out to the little postoffices and country stores, where the traveling libraries are given homes, and sent about the country.  Since its establishment five years ago in New York state the traveling library movement has excited a tremendous amount of popular interest.  By last May there were twenty-five different systems of traveling libraries in twenty different states.  They are today sending out 1,700 traveling libraries, or more than 75,000 volumes.  In the states of New York, Ohio, Iowa and Michigan the traveling libraries are sent out by the states.  In all of the other states the traveling libraries are sent out by individuals or by individual associations, principally woman's clubs."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Traveling Libraries Discussed.</head>
                            <p>A paper on traveling libraries written by J. I. Wyer, librarian of the University of Nebraska, was read by Miss Ahern.  H. W. Hughes of the University of Chicago was unable to be present to deliver the address which he promised.  Mrs. John C. McClintock, former president of the Kansas State Federation of Women's clubs at Topeka, read a highly instructive paper on "The Relation of Women's Clubs to the Traveling Library."</p>
                            <p>In the discussion that followed, Mrs. C. F. Stoutenborough, president of the Nebraska State Federation of Women's clubs, responded as follows:  "You who know me expect that I will stand up for Nebraska, and I propose to do it this morning.  Our state has accomplished a wonderful amount of good through the traveling libraries.  Two years ago Nebraska took up this subject.  We then looked around for models in other states, but only in one state, New York, found anything in the way of traveling libraries after which we could pattern.  We organized the movement with great enthusiasm, but not without some discouragements.  We collected 10 cents from each member, and between October and January had secured $200 for the work.  In the first year we bought sixty books for eight clubs, and the movement was fairly started in Nebraska.  The work is supported entirely by voluntary contributions.  We are fortunate in having a most generous, self-sacrificing and painstaking librarian, Mrs. G. M. Lambertson of Lincoln.  Success has been the outcome of the organization.  We all are firmly convinced that there is no better work than that of traveling libraries.  The same women who stood back of the charity for our sufferers from drouth in 1893 are the women who today are standing back of the traveling libraries.  They gave the poor of the country districts food and clothes then; today they give them good books and magazines."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Relation One of Necessity.</head>
                            <p>Mrs. W. W. Keysor happily concluded the morning's program.  In part she said:  "The relation of traveling libraries to women's clubs is one of necessity.  Unless our study in our clubs can be made effective and thorough it will pass away.  We want to hear no more annual reports of clubs who have covered the history of the world and the history of art in one season.  When we hear reports of the thorough study of one period, say, the reformation, we know that effective work is being accomplished, and for this work we must have books.  We must go on enlarging our libraries.  While we are waiting for the wheels of legislation to give us state aid we women must stand back of the traveling libraries and give them our loyal support.  When the state finally takes this out of our hands, as it some day must, then we must set the people to work at the libraries in their midst.  A sadder thing than no library at all is to see a library unused.  We can augment the work of university extension.  There will never be a time when we cannot, for we can carry our work into homes where the term "university extension" is not understood and will not be understood for a long time to come."</p>

                            <p>The Transmississippi Sunday school congress gave place to the Nebraska State association in the First Methodist Episcopal church this morning.  Prayer for the state association was led by Rev. J. A. Pollock of Tecumseh.  Dr. Merrill of Chicago gave the last of his series of table studies on "The Picture of Jesus."  The business of the convention of the state association commenced properly at 10 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>W. R. Williams of Pawnee, J. P. Eaton of Mapleville and Miss Mattie Hamilton of Minden were appointed a committee on resolutions and Rev. J. A. Pollock of Tecumseh, W. E. Nichol of Minden, B. F. Merrill of Grand Island, Mrs. H. J. Penfold of Omaha and Mrs. C. L. Jones of Hastings, a nominating committee.  An auditing committee as also composed of F. W. Kiplinger of Loomis, L. P. Albright of Red Cloud and Charles B. Whilden of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>A report made by Field Secretary R. H. Pollock of Beatrice was not very encouraging.  It lamented a falling off in the number of Sunday school children in the state amounting to 20,000, also the lax methods of some officers in the making of their reports.  Twenty-three counties had shown a decrease of 14,207, and twenty-one an increase of 4,539.  Of twenty-six unorganized counties thirteen showed a decrease of 3,245.  The greatest decrease had been in Custer county; it had fallen from 11,960 to 4,240 in the year.  Knox county showed the highest increase&#8212;828.  The number of Sunday schools in the state is 2,538; classes, 17,000; total membership, 169,700; home departments, 1,042; normal students, 197; number of Sunday school pupils having joined the churches, 1,545, and about $1,000 had been raised for state and county association work.  The greatest obstacle, said Mr. Pollock, was the failure of the church people to properly understand the interdenominational plan of work.</p>

                            <p>Recording Secretary E. J. Wightman of York reported a showing of collections amounting to $1,148.10, Gage county being the highest with $83.60, and Burt, Hall and Thayer following with $60.70, $57.27 and $54.20 respectively.  J. P. Eaton raised his county, Dodge, from $30 to $50 by adding a $20 bill.  Douglas and Lancaster counties made a comparatively poor showing.  Treasurer W. A. Heimberger of Grand Island was able to present a balance of over $1,200 for the year with a few dollars left since Mr. Eaton's donation.  Secretary W. H. Kimberly of Lincoln gave a report on the normal work which was encouraging.  A roll of the counties was called for financial pledges and between $600 and $700 was promised.</p>
                            <p>On the report of the nominating committee, President George G. Wallace of Omaha, Vice President W. R. Jackson of Lincoln, Secretary E. J. Wightman of York and Treasurer W. A. Heimberger of Grand Island were all re-elected unanimously.  Ten trustees were chosen as follows:  Mrs. J. E. Winchester of Lincoln, W. H. Kimberly of Lincoln, Rev. J. A. Pollock of Tecumseh, F. W. Kiplinger of Loomis, Mrs. C. L. Jones of Hastings, Rev. J. D. Stewart of Aurora, W. A. Harding of Oakland, Rev. Dr. Jordan of Grand Island, W. P. Harford and Mrs. George S. Brewster of Omaha.  An executive committee of five was also named in the following:  Rev. J. A. Pollock of Tecumseh, B. F. Merrill of Grand Island, W. E. Nichol of Minden, Miss Emma St. Louis of Petersburg, and Mrs. C. L. Jones of Hastings.</p>
                            <p>The resolutions sent up by Chairman Williams of the committee to draw them up recommended the interdenominational plan of work of the International association, congratulated the Transmississippi congress on its success, and extended thanks and felicitations to the speakers who had attended and to President Wallace.</p>

                            <p>Two addresses last evening practically concluded the work of the Transmississippi congress.  These were by E. B. Stevenson of Cedar Rapids, Ia., on "The Sunday School as a Pioneer Agency" and Prof. H. M. Hamill on "The Bible and the Child."</p>
                            <p>This morning will be given up particularly to Nebraska state association work, the state convention to be held at 10 o'clock.  Dr. Merrill of Chicago will finish his series of bible studies on "The Picture of Jesus."  There is also to be a meeting of the primary and other teachers of the city for the purpose of forming a primary teachers' union here.  It will be conducted by Mrs. Preuszner and Miss Hall.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Stevenson's address was full of statistics to show what has been done in Sunday school work, more especially by the American Sunday School union, and what yet remains to be done.  It was accompanied by a number of charts, a map being also suspended in front of the organ to show the percentage of Sunday school children to the population in the various states, which was given as 17.4.  Nebraska's percentage runs above the average.  It is 19 per cent of the population.  The figures of Mr. Stevenson's map were:  Population of the United States in 1896, 70,595,321; children and youth, 5 to 18 years of age, 20,365,377; number of Sunday schools in the country, 132,639; total attendance of Sunday schools, 12,286,600; children and youth, 5 to 18 years of age, in the Sunday schools, 8,191,067; children and youth ranging between these ages not in the Sunday schools, 12,674,312.  It also communicated the information that $500,000 is needed by the American Sunday School union annually to reach the millions not in the Sunday schools.  The speaker elaborated upon the success of the interdenominational method of establishing schools, particularly among the foreign elements and the mountain whites.</p>

                            <p>The address of Prof. Hamill was a beautiful tribute to childhood, or rather to children.  Some of it was of a didactic nature in the way of a scouting of the theory that children are naturally chained to sin and included under the sweeping ban of total depravity by mere heredity.  On the other hand, he demurred to the assumption that the child is vested with a sort of organic religion by simply having been born of Christian parents.  In this connection the speaker considered the belief that all that is necessary to insure the highest religious status of the child is to give it proper educational environment, a kind of "refined Confucianism."  Nevertheless he made much of memory and memorization and put in a good word for the Presbyterian denomination for its plan of enjoining the memorization of the "shorter catechism."  He himself, he said, in answer to a question, is not a member of that church; he simply looked at things from a philosophical point of view.  The conclusion of his address was a most artistic piece of word painting to the exaltation of the children, "for," quoting the Master, "of such is the kingdom of heaven."</p>
                            <p>Before the doxology a rising vote of thanks and a Chautauqua salute were given to President Wallace for his work of promoting the congress.  The motion was made by Prof. Hamill.</p>

                            <p>Another niche in the educational history of the Transmississippi Exposition year is being filled during the last half of this week by the Art congress at the First Congregational church.  The first session of the congress was held yesterday afternoon and the remaining sessions will be held this morning, afternoon and evening and tomorrow morning and afternoon.  A program of lectures by eminent artists has been arranged for the two days.  Judging from the initiatory lecture yesterday afternoon the congress will be full of instruction and enjoyment for the lovers of art of the city and can be ill afforded to be missed by them.</p>
                            <p>When Chairman Paul Charlton of the local committee called the session to order there was a rather slim audience in attendance.  Mrs. W. W. Keysor, who as chairman of the educational committee was largely instrumental in making possible the congress, welcomed the visiting artists and in the course of her remarks said:</p>
                            <p>"One would judge from the size of this audience that there is no art spirit in Omaha, but such a spirit is here.  It is coming from 300 and more school rooms, from at least one private art gallery, from an art school that is soon to be started and from the art department of the Woman's club.  Therefore, in behalf of the educational committee, the art department of the Woman's club and of all in Omaha who stand up for art I welcome our visitors who have so generously given themselves for our enlightenment.  It is an honor to have them here."</p>
                            <p>Chairman Charlton introduced Lorado Taft of Chicago as chairman of the congress.  Mr. Taft made a few pleasing remarks in assuming the position.  He declared that he as well as other artists of Chicago have had a growing desire to visit the western cities in the interests of art and therefore gladly availed himself of the opportunity to come to Omaha.  He declared that he as well as other artists of Chicago have had a growing desire to visit the western cities in the interests of art and therefore gladly availed himself of the opportunity to come to Omaha.  He declared that in his travels through the west he had found that there were many, particularly women, who were yearning for a knowledge of the fine arts.  To such in Omaha he bid a hearty welcome to attend the features that will be provided.  He presented as the lecturer of the afternoon Ralph Clarkson of Chicago, whose topic was "How to Judge a Picture and How to Enjoy It."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ideas of an Artist.</head>
                            <p>Artist Clarkson declared that the present attitude of the public is prejudicial to the interests of art, as there is a tendency toward superficial criticism&#8212;to pick out the faults and flaws of a picture and overlook the beauties it contains.  Yet it is possible to become a competent and intelligent critic, but possible only through an intelligent study of nature and of art.</p>
                            <p>"People see objects of nature with the eye," said Mr. Clarkson, "and think that they know them.  As a matter of fact their view has been superficial and is of the bare outline.  Little of what we see is observed.  The eye requires as much attention as the hand that draws a line.  Men are too busy and neglect the artistic for the practical.  Yet they dare to pass judgment on a picture because it does not look like nature.  It is necessary that you should study nature, and observe nature under all its conditions, for it is never twice alike.</p>
                            <p>"You must cultivate your artistic tastes by beautiful surroundings.  After nature study pictures.  Be sure and associate with the best.  If you can, own a picture at present beyond your appreciation.  One thing you must avoid.  If told that a picture is painted by a great painter, do not think to determine the qualities that make the picture great.  You may pick out what you consider its elements of greatness, and which in reality are its weaknesses.  Ask what the qualities are.  Seek to see how the artist displays them.  One picture thus appreciated, learned, understood, will change your tastes and elevate your standard."</p>
                            <p>During the remainder of his lecture Mr. Clarkson pointed out some of the features that go to make up a good picture, illustrating his remarks with a series of stereopticon views of paintings.  He said that it was generally believed that a painting must be an imitation of nature, but he declared it is impossible to do this successfully on account of the scanty material with which the artist must work.</p>

                            <head type="sub">What an Artist Can Do.</head>
                            <p>For example, if 100 represents the brightest white in nature and one darkness, it is possible for the artist to reproduce upon the canvas only from ten to forty of this gradation.  Then the public generally believes that the subject of the picture should tell the story, whereas, as a matter of fact, the subjects of famous old masterpieces are often unknown or obscure.  The physical charms of a painting come before the subject and the picture itself should tell the story.  Another popular belief is that the details should be worked out in a picture, such as the man's features or the leaves of the tree.  The lecturer pointed out that as a matter of fact such details in nature can be seen but a short distance.</p>
                            <p>In much the same manner the lecturer pointed out what places other elements have in making up a picture&#8212;perspective, proportion, color, composition.  In criticising a picture all must be considered together in order to discover the artist's idea, to ascertain what he is trying to say to the spectator.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Analogies Explained.</head>
                            <p>W. M. R. French, director of the Chicago Art Institute, addressed the congress this morning, illustrating  his remarks by drawings in crayon.  The attendance was not large, and was composed almost entirely of women, but the lecturer's drawings were alone worth more of an audience, putting aside all question of the technical value of his lecture.  He took for his subject "Analogies Between Art and Literature," being illustrations of certain analogies between composition in graphic art and composition in literary art.  Among other things he said:</p>
                            <p>"Audiences generally are more familiar with literary than with graphic art, yet there is a striking similarity between the two.  The writer of a sermon or a book first prepares an outline of his subject, and later fills in with anecdote and description, and embellishes with rhetoric.  So it is with the artist.  After deciding upon his picture, he then makes a rough draught of its outlines.  The first lesson taught in the art school is to sketch the subject model with the fewest possible lines to make it recognizable.  Then then fill in with the little things, but the whole picture hangs on the original lines.</p>
                            <p>"We speak of making a skeleton of our work.  In the literary world the use of this term is in a figurative sense, but artists generally deal with real bones.  To attempt to draw the human figure the artist must understand the formation of that figure.  If you attempt to draw a man in the act of striking a blow, and it is inconvenient to secure an athlete for a model, you try to think what position the bones would take in placing your man in the proper position."</p>
                            <p>Here the lecturer drew the skeleton of a man in an attitude of striking, and afterward built him up, presumably into a thing of flesh and blood.</p>
                            <p>"The task upon the artist is to produce a picture which shall appeal to us as strongly as he intends it should.  There are many acknowledged laws of composition, not founded by the artists themselves, but by recognized critics, such as Ruskin.  These are principality, balance, curvature, continuity, radation, repetition contrast, interchange, simplicity and harmony."</p>
                            <p>These points were then each in turn illustrated in sketches by the speaker and later on were all combined in one picture.  The lecturer made further reference to the similitude between the work of the graphic artist and literary artist by telling the thoughts which actuated Edgar Poe when he wrote "The Raven," as Poe himself told it after the poem had been published.  He showed how all the laws of composition mentioned here were brought into use by the poet in building his great poem.</p>
                            <p>This afternoon at 3 o'clock Charles Francis Brown will lecture on "American Artists," and this evening Miss Anna Caulfield will give her lecture on "Golden Age of Italian Art."</p>

                            <p>School children were everywhere in evidence about the railroad stations this morning.  Every incoming train brought its quota of small boys and girls to participate in the pleasure of Children's day at the exposition and the cars that carried them were labeled by the myriads of handkerchiefs that fluttered from the windows whenever a train drew into the station.</p>
                            <p>The delegations from Hastings and Holdridge were first to arrive.  They came in three coaches, at 8 o'clock, being followed shortly after by parties of children from Beatrice and Wymore who filled four cars.</p>
                            <p>The boys and girls attending the schools of Blair turned out in greatest numbers and traveled in the best style.  There were 900 of them.  They had their own band, a military band of twenty members, who wore striking uniforms and played patriotic airs whenever a station was passed and they had a special train of twelve coaches through which they romped and played and had a good time until the exposition grounds were reached.  They were in charge of their superintendent, W. K. Fowler.</p>
