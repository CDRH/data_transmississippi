<p>PREFATORY.</p> 

<p>IT has been the aim of the Art Department to form 
a collection of pictures which might show the 
various phases of art expression by characteristic 
and meritorious works of leading painters of the 
various schools, and which should include examples 
of the Academic, Realist, Naturalist and Impressionist styles of painting. In other words the 
endeavor has been made to form a collection that 
shall be interesting and entertaining, and also educational both to the general exposition visitor and 
to the artist and amateur as well. The limitations 
imposed by the construction of the building, of 
materials not absolutely permanent and fire-proof, 
has somewhat limited the range of schools and the 
importance of examples, but the hope is expressed 
that, notwithstanding, the collection will accomplish the design with which it was formed.</p> 

<p>An examination of the catalogue and of the pictures in detail will show that most of the leading 
American and foreign artists are represented, and 
an opportunity &#8212;seldom offered to the people of the 
Trans-Mississippi states &#8212;is given to examine at 
leisure and in a public exhibition works of art covering important examples of all the schools. </p>

<p>The sculpture is almost exclusively American 
and very fairly represents the scope and direction 
of the recent revival of sculpture, both purely 
artistic, and also decorative and architectural, 
which is so marked in this country.</p> 

<p>In addition to original works of art in painting 
and sculpture, there will be noticed a small but 
carefully selected collection of reproductions by 

<pb n="unnumbered" xml:id="transmiss.book.finearts.1898.010"/>

autotype and otherwise, of old master-pieces of painting and sculpture, and original cartoons and carbon reproductions of recent important mural painting, which has been done by native and foreign 
artists in this country, and which will afford many 
visitors an opportunity not otherwise available to 
form an idea of what has been and is being done in 
those branches of art.</p> 

<p>The art department desires to express its acknowledgement of and thanks for the courtesy and 
generosity of the various artist contributors, owners 
of pictures, and those who otherwise have aided in 
the formation of the present exibit. The names of 
the former occur in the catalogue; among the latter may be mentioned especially, Mr. Charles M. 
Kurtz and Mr. Halsey C. Ives, Director of the 
Art Museum, St. Louis, Missouri; Mr. W. M. R. 
French, Director of the Chicago Art Institute; M. 
M. Durand-Ruel, Paris and New York; Mr. Russell 
Spaulding, New York; Mr. H. P. Whitmore, 
Omaha; the Directors of the Detroit Museum of 
Art; Mr. Charles F. Haseltine, of Philadelphia; M . 
Fredrick Mayer, Paris; Messrs. Ad. Braun et Cie, 
of Dornach, Paris and New York; Messrs. Curtis 
and Cameron, Boston; M. Michel Levi, Paris; Mrs. 
C. O. Hanford, William Dole, esqre., Hon. R. Hall 
McCormick, and Wm. O. Cole, esqre., Chicago; 
The Art Institute, Chicago; Mr. Geo. Busse and 
William T. Evans, esqre., of New York; and Hon. 
Theo. Cooley, Nashville.</p>

his achievement be less in actual amount of production 
than that of his fellow artists, it must not be forgotten 
that without him, perhaps, there would have been no 
school or group &#8212;that is, without him the chief source of

<p>PARK, Stuart&#8212;Glasgow, Scotland.</p> 

<p>Among all the painters of the Glasgow Sehool there is 
none whose methods are more simple or whose results are 
more subtle and artistic than those of Stuart Park. He 
loves flowers, and he paints them as no other artist on 
earth paints them. In his pictures their color is as pure 
and unsullied and their petals are as fresh and crisp as in 
nature. They lack only the fragrance of the real flowers, 
but they have the advantage of never fading nor withering. They remain beautiful always.</p>

Scottish Academy, and corresponding member 
of " The Secession, " Munich. Paintings by Mr. 
Paterson have been purchased by the National 
galleries at Munich, Leipsic, Weimar and Stuttgart.</p> 

<p>One of the most individual and poetic landscape painters is Mr. James Paterson. Seldom, if ever, concerning 
himself with what is termed the picturesque or romantic 
in scenery, attempting no striking pictorial effects, Mr. 
Paterson nevertheless succeeds, and succeeds to admiration, in his attempts to seek out and transfer to canvas 
some of the more fleeting of the more delicate aspects of 
nature. * * * Mr. Paterson's style combines reticence, 
tenderness and truth&#8212;truth at once to nature and to 
art. &#8212;Glasgow Citizen.</p>

<p>Roybet, who loves strong color, in his work shows fine 
maturity of talent. He paints with a solidity of touch 
and with a certainty with which few of his brethren can 
compete, and his art is healthy and robust. &#8212;Roger Miles 
in The Salon, 1894.</p> 

<p>470 Charles the Bold at Nesle. (Illustration.)</p> 

<p>Medal of Honor, Salon, Paris, 1893. (Size of canvas, 
22x24 feet.)</p> 

<p>This painting&#8212;for which the artist received the highest 
award given during the year of its first exhibition&#8212;depicts 
an episode that occurred in the reign of Louis XI. That 
king, having caused the Duke of Guienne to be poisoned, 
the younger brother of the duke, Charles of Burgundyknown variously as "the Bold" and "the Terrible"&#8212;made 
a foray into Picardy, partly for the sake of revenge, and 
no doubt partly for the sake of plunder. In his course, 
he besieged the little city of Nesle, the defence of which 
was short. The surrender of the city was mo sufficient 
for Charles. He ordered everyone to be struck down and 
everything to be destroyed. He caused his followers to 
cut off the hands of many of those who had borne arms 

<pb n="98" xml:id="transmiss.book.finearts.1898.108"/> 

to oppose his entry into the city. Some of the terrified 
citizens who remained alive having taken refuge in the 
church, Charles, inflamed with victory and hatred, rode 
into the sacred edifice, crushing beneath his horse's hoofs 
the bodies of the defenseless fugitives, and inciting his 
soldiery to further rapine and pillage. This is the moment chosen by the artist for representation.</p> 

<p>Commynes, a chronicler of the time, who was with 
Charles, protesting against these barbarities, Charles exclaimed: "Such is the fruit borne by the tree of war!"</p> 

<p>Charles the Bold was killed at the battle of Nancy, in 
1477. The massacre at Nesle occurred in June. 1472.</p>

<p>There is more than the visible beauty of Nature in his 
pictures; they are imbued with that informing spirit 
which makes Nature more to us than mere inert matter. 
In portraiture, while never losing touch with Nature, he

<p>GOVERNMENT.</p> 

<p>This consists of a series of five paintings; in the 
first &#8212;</p>

<p>"Government," the central figure, is that of a 
goddess, as she may be considered, sitting on a marbio seat or throne, which is supported on posts whose 
shape is intended to recall the antique voting urn. </p>

<p>"Corrupt Legislation" is represented by a 
woman with a beautiful but depraved face, sitting 
in an abandoned attitude on a throne, the arms of 
which are cornucopias overflowing with the coin 
which is the revenue of the state.</p> 

<p>"Anarchy" is represented raving upon the 
ruins of the civilization she has destroyed. In one 
hand she holds the wine cup which makes mad, and 
in the other the incendiary torch, formed of the 
scroll of learning. To the right, Violence, his eyes 
turned to gaze upon the cup of madness, is prying 
out the corner-stone of a temple. To the left, Ignorance, is using a surveyor's staff to precipitate the 
wreckage of civilization into the chasm which opens 
in the foreground. </p>

<pb n="134" xml:id="transmiss.book.finearts.1898.144"/>

<p>"Good Administration" sits holding in her right hand a pair of scales evenly poised, and with her left laid upon a shield, quartered to represent the even balance of parties and classes which should obtain in a well ordered democracy. To the left is another voting urn, into which a young girl is winnowing wheat, so that the good grains fall into its mouth while the chaff is scattered by the wind.</p>

<p>In "Peace and Prosperity" the central figure is crowned with olive, the emblem of peace, and holds in her hands olive wreaths to be bestowed as the reward of excellence. On either side is a youth, the one to her right typifying the Arts and the other Agriculture.</p>
