                            <head type="sub">NO SUCH FEATURE OF THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Fairy Story from California Still Gives Cause for Worry, Despite Repeated Denials from the Omaha Officials.</head>
                            <p>A joke which was perpetrated more than a year ago by a party of exposition officials and representatives which visited California and other western points in the interest of the exposition has come home to plague the officials who were mainly responsible for its existence, and who are now kept busy denying that there was anything more serious intended than a joke.</p>
                            <p>When the party referred to reached the southern part of California the wine growers of that region revived a scheme which had originated in the fertile brain of some native, and while exposition enthusiasm was on tap it was suggested that the wine producing districts of California should install at the exposition an exhibit of wine in the form of a miniature Niagara falls, with the pure juice of the grape substituted for water.  It was stated that such an exhibit would require 100,000 gallons of native wine and the changes were rung on this old story, which no one took seriously, as it had been suggested in connection with the World's fair, the California Midwinter fair and other expositions, but had never been near realization.</p>
                            <p>After the return of the exposition pilgrims this story about the Niagara in wine was repeated for the delectation of those who stayed at home, receiving additions with every repetition, until it had become a tale to the effect that the California grape growers had paid for space and would instal an exhibit containing 100,000 gallons of wine, which was to be surrounded by beautiful gardens and enticing grottos with all the blandishments of beautiful women and soothing music and the young men and women who visited the exposition were to be invited to enter and drink of the wine, without money and without price.</p>
                            <p>This story was repeated with many variations in the "ready print" newspapers of the country and the result <choice><sic>it</sic><corr>is</corr></choice> that petitions have been circulated by all of the temperance organizations of the country, protesting against this wholesale destruction of the young men and women of the country and petitioning the exposition management to exclude this awful exhibition before it had wrecked thousands of happy homes, etc.  These petitions have been coming into exposition headquarters at short intervals for several months and contain the signatures of thousands of persons.  They are from all parts of the country, principally from the west, and are mainly the result of efforts on the part of the members of the Woman's Christian Temperance union.  In addition to these petitions, letters have been sent to various officers of the exposition, asking them to authorize the use of their names in the denial of these stories, "if there is no truth in them," and this has invariably been given; but the flood continues and the exposition authorities are at a loss how to correct the impression, which seems to have become general in certain quarters, that the exposition is going to offer unlimited opportunities for the accumulation of "jags," delirium tremens and other old things.</p>
                            <p>It may be stated, on the authority of every officer of the exposition and the managers of the several departments which would have to do with any such exhibit, that nothing of the kind is contemplated, that no application for such an exhibit has ever been made, that none is likely to be made, that no such exhibit has ever been made, that none is likely to be made, that no such exhibit will be made on the exposition grounds and that there is no probability of any affair of this kind being in operation in Omaha during the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Another Inventor Wants to Secure Space for His Own Device.</head>
                            <p>F. M. Groves, president of a company which has been formed in Evansville, Ind., for the manufacture of flying machines, writes to the exposition authorities to invite an offer for the construction and operation of one of these machines in connection with the exposition.</p>
                            <p>According to the letter of Mr. Groves and a newspaper article clipped from an Evansville paper, the flying machine in question was invented by Arcidas Farmer, a resident of that section.  The machine is said to consist of a cigar-shaped balloon made of silk and inflated with gas.  From this is suspended the car which carries the passengers and three gasoline engines of thirty horse-power, whose combined weight is 300 pounds.  At either side of the balloon, about midway of the length, is a large propelling wheel like the wheels on a "sidewheel steamboat," and at the rear of the balloon is a propeller screw.  Both wheels and the propeller screw are operated by means of the engines, and are to be made of aluminum.</p>
                            <p>The striking feature of the machine, and the one which the inventor claims is entirely different from the device used on any other flying machine, is a shell which covers about three-fourths of each of the side wheels.  The inventor claims that by shifting this shell so that the open space comes at different points of the wheels he can cause the machine to ascend, descend, go ahead or back.</p>
                            <p>According to the newspaper clipping referred to, the inventor has never made a full sized machine, but has a working model which is said to work successfully.  Mr. Groves says he will guarantee the machine will work if the wind velocity does not exceed twenty miles per hour.  He desires to make an arrangement with the exposition management on the exposition grounds and operating it in connection with the show.</p>
                            <p>It has been several months since the exposition authorities received a proposition from any of the numerous inventors of air ships or flying machines and the last one has an air of novelty, but it is scarcely probable that any very great encouragement will be held out to the proposers.</p>

Richardson, who has been in Little Rock and other points in Arkansas during the last two weeks stirring up an interest in exposition matters and the project of having a creditable exhibit at the exposition of the resources of the state, sends word that a delegation of representative men, members of the exposition commission recently appointed by Governor Jones, will be in Omaha Monday of nest week to look over the grounds and make arrangements for an Arkansas exhibit.</p>

He will go well supplied with advertising matter and official invitations from the authorities.</p>
                            <p>R. B. Owens, director of the bureau of electricity of the exposition, has notified President Wattles that the American Institute of Electrical Engineers will meet in Omaha during the exposition, at a date to be fixed later.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The adoption by the senate today of Senator Allen's amendment providing for the holding of an Indian congress at Omaha between June and November of this year, and appropriating $45,000 therefor, gives the amendment a prestige which almost insures its final adoption by both houses.</p>
                            <p>Now that the amendment has been attached to the Indian bill it will depend entirely upon the conferees to say whether it shall become a law or not.  On the part of the senate the conferees will be Allison, Pettigrew and Perkins.  On the part of the house, Sherman, Curtis of Kansas and Little.  It is within the house conferees that yeoman service must be done, but Mercer says his associates will be all right, in view of their interest in other measures affecting their own  districts, and in which he is also interested.  It is possible, however, that a fight may be made against the amendment on the floor, in which case the whole Nebraska delegation will take part in the discussion.  There are several elements to be conciliated and these Mercer will look after, especially one or two members from Chicago districts, who, smarting over their inability thus far to secure a repeal of the law creating an Indian supply depot at Omaha, have thought it good politics to oppose the Indian congress measure.  However, with the conferees favorable to the amendment it is believed that any opposition that may develop will be summarily disposed of.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston attempted to attach an amendment to the Indian bill appropriating $25,000 for an additional building or buildings at the Genoa Indian school as might be necessary in the judgment of the commissioner of Indian affairs, but Senator Allison made the point of order against the amendment, from which Senator Allen appealed, and in the call that followed the senate adjourned.  In view of the handsome treatment accorded the Indian congress bill by the committee on appropriations, and also the Genoa school in the way of appropriation for steam heating apparatus, etc., it has been thought good policy to let any additional amount for Genoa go over until later.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Commission Reorganizes and Gets Ready to Make an Active Hustle in Behalf of the Great Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Exposition matters are in a most flourishing condition in Colorado and there is no longer a question about the Centennial state being represented at the exposition in a manner which will cause its citizens to swell with pride when visiting the great fair.</p>
                            <p>The Colorado commission held a spirited meeting in Denver Tuesday night and heard the reports of the representatives who had visited Omaha, Messrs. A. T. Macdonald and W. S. Ward, and then the position of the state commission towards the various county and district organizations was defined in the following motion which was offered by W. S. Ward and seconded by Mrs. Emma Homan Thayer, well known in Omaha and one of the exposition city's firmest friends:</p>
                            <p>The state commission extends to the several local organizations, such as the Arkansas valley counties, the western slope counties, the city of Denver and the northern counties, its hearty appreciation of their efforts in furthering the interests of the state in the coming Transmississippi and International Exposition and assures them of its heartiest sympathy and support.</p>
                            <p>And, that the secretary be instructed to inform the several organizations that the state board has in its possession assignments of space with regulations regarding them, together with plats and all information which is likely to be of service to local organizations, and suggests that they at once put themselves in correspondence with the secretary in Denver, in order that their own individual efforts may be expedited and simplified.</p>
                            <p>Governor Adams increased the state commission by adding three members, Deputy City Auditor A. T. Macdonald of Denver, Miss Grace Espy Patton, state superintendent of education, and C. B. Schmidt of Pueblo, a resident of Omaha for many years.</p>
                            <p>The resignation of George M. Mischke as secretary of the commission was accepted and A. T. Macdonald was elected to the vacancy.</p>
                            <p>It was announced that the horticulturists of the state have raised about $9,000 with which to make an exhibit of the horticultural resources of the state, and Mining Commissioner H. A. Lee announced that the state mining exhibit is stored in the capitol building and can be transported to Omaha at slight cost, with such additions as may be needed to make it one of the finest mineral collections in the west.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit to be made by the horticulturists will be under the general supervision of Mrs. M. A. Shute, secretary of the State Board of Horticulture; agriculture will be under the supervision of Messrs. Ellis and Allison, fine arts will be supervised by Mrs. E. A. Thayer and the educational exhibit by Grace Espy Patton.</p>
                            <p>The members of the commission were greatly pleased with the locations assigned Colorado in the main buildings, as shown by the report of Messrs. Ward and Macdonald, and the committee felt very much encouraged at the outlook for a fine exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Another meeting of the board will be held today to further advance the work of the commission.</p>

                            <p>From every section included in the itinerary of the coming tour of Nebraska business men comes the most cheering news.  In reply to letters of Chairman Green announcing the route there have been received many replies which indicate the interest taken in the success of the exposition, under whose auspices this tour will be undertaken.  W. G. Boyd, president of the Mercantile club of St. Louis, writes that the delegation will be met at the Southern

The communication refers to the wide publicity certain to be acquired through the medium of such a reception, and announces the fullest sympathy and interest in the great object, for which the tour was projected.</p>
                            <p>The Louisville Commercial club, through its president, T. L. Jefferson, announces that the delegation will be heartily welcomed.  To those who have experienced the cordial character of Kentucky hospitality, the nature of this reception will be readily understood.</p>
                            <p>C. B. Murray, superintendent of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, writes that the visitors will be tendered a reception on the trading floor, where ample opportunity will be afforded to exploit the interests of the great exposition.  By way of diversion a trolley ride through the city has been arranged, during which the delegation will view the beautiful surroundings of the great Queen City.  This trip will include a view of the Ohio river from the magnificent new bridge, and a flying visit to Covington on the Kentucky side.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Linxweiler of Dayton, O. in his letter, says:  "The citizens of Dayton will esteem it a pleasure to meet the people of your delegation, and bid them welcome to the Gem City of the West."</p>
                            <p>Hon. D. T. West, editor of the Sunday News of Springfield, O., writes:  "We will see that you are properly received and given an audience.  Not only will we throw open the gates of our city to the Nebraskans, but will garland our outer walls and strew your pathway with roses."</p>
                            <p>Mayor Taggart of Indianapolis announces that the Commercial club of that city has the matter in charge, and will extend a very cordial welcome to the delegation.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Anderson of Jackson, Tenn., after promising a hearty welcome to the visitors, says arrangements have been made to have Rev. S. Wright Butler of Omaha preach at the Presbyterian church in that city on the evening of Sunday, February 20.</p>
                            <p>Captain M. J. Saunders, chairman of the executive committee of the Harbor Improvement association at New Orleans, writes that the newly organized Progressive union of that city will have charge of the arrangements for entertaining the delegation.  As the party will reach the Crescent City in the midst of the annual mardi-gras festivities this stop is looked forward to with pleasing anticipation.</p>

                            <head type="sub">APPROPRIATION MAY BE SMALL.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Legislature May Not Treat the Exposition with Liberality.</head>
                            <p>I. M. Treynor, from the committee on legislation, made a rather unfavorable report at the meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Exposition association last night.  Mr. Treynor had been delegated to go to Des Moines in the interest of the larger appropriation asked from the legislature for the Iowa building and exhibit.  He made a careful canvass of the members of the <choice><sic>essembly</sic><corr>assembly</corr></choice> and in his report last night he stated the exact position of every member of the Iowa senate on the subject of the appropriation.  The report contained a statement from each member as to just what he would and would not do in the way of voting for an appropriation.  A number of the senators did not favor any further appropriation, many of them favored an additional sum of $10,000, several from $15,000 to $20,000 and a few the full amount asked for&#8212;$47,000.  He gave it as his opinion that the best that could be expected from the members of the senate was the further appropriation of from $10,000 to $20,000.  There was a disposition in the house to treat the exposition more liberally, but as the senate would have the final say, he feared that the original plans of the Iowa commissioners could not be realized unless something unforeseen transpired to awaken state pride and make it felt in the senate.  He said there was a strong feeling in favor of the plan of enacting special legislation for the purpose of permitting the counties of the state to make separate exhibits, and a majority of the members of the senate had assured him that they would vote for such a bill if Senator Pusey would introduce it.</p>
                            <p>The report was discussed at length by the members of the association, and it was decided in the event it became apparent that no large general appropriation could be hoped for to have the special bill passed authorizing the county boards throughout the state to make the necessary appropriations for the independent exhibits to be made in the state building.  By resolution the legislative committee was instructed to confer with Senator Pusey and the Pottawattamie delegation with a view of premium amount to be appropriated by the counties, and this amount will be about what the larger counties in the state, like Pottawattamie and Polk, will be willing to set aside for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>Hon. Lafe Young, president of the Iowa Press association, submitted a suggestion that an invitation from the Council Bluffs committee would result in the State Press association holding its annual meeting here this summer.  Mr. Young intimated that the association would like to meet about June 20, and after the work of the session was over spend a few days visiting the exposition and sightseeing in the two cities, and especially visiting the gardens and vineyards surrounding Council Bluffs.  He said all the press association would expect would be the usual reduction in hotel bill extended to all members of large associations, and that the editors would pay their own bills.  The committee on solicitation was instructed to promptly act upon the suggestion and extend a cordial invitation to President Young to hold the annual meeting here.  Mr. Young says there will be about 300 editors present, and he thinks the free advertising the editors will give the exposition and Council Bluffs will be valuable and opportune.</p>
                            <p>The soliciting committees made a report of the subscriptions received during the two afternoons that they worked which greatly encouraged the association.  The amount reported exceeded even the most sanguine expectations of the members.  For the purpose of further strengthening the committees the chairman of each was empowered to impress any member of the executive committee he saw fit and have him aid in the work of soliciting funds.  The reports of the committees showed that only a small portion of the work of canvassing the city had been accomplished and they were given another week in which to complete the work.</p>
                            <p>A request from the art department of the Woman's clubs that the association change the date of its meeting next week so as not to conflict with the Dickens party, which is to occur next Thursday night, was not granted.</p>
                            <p>Warren Hough of Crescent notified the association that he had recently received from a friend a valuable relic found on the Wounded Knee battleground which some Sioux brave had lost, and offered to contribute it to the curio department in the wigwam.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TWO GENTLEMEN FROM LOUISIANA.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Here to Arrange for a State Exhibit at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>There are at present in the city W. C. Stubbs, Ph. D., chief of the government experiment stations of Louisiana, and Major J. G. Lee, head of the station at Baton Rouge, on business connected with the representation of that state at the exposition.  If they are successful in making desired arrangements the Louisianians believe the agricultural exhibit from their state will lead all others in versatility and luxuriance of products.  The legislature which meets in May is looked to for a suitable appropriation and Governor Foster is so assured that provision will be made that he has authorized the expenditure of $15,000 to set forth the resources of the state.  Prof. Stubbs says, therefore, that he expects that a good showing will be made from "the most fertile 40,000 square miles in the country."</p>
                            <p>Prof. Stubbs and Major Lee are just now interested in the outcome of a constitutional convention which is being held in Louisiana and which they state is very incompletely reported in the papers.  The convention was called by a heavy majority at the last election for the purpose of revising the constitution in the important regards of the elective franchise, the state judiciary and the school system.  In speaking of the state government of Louisiana, Prof. Stubbs said last night:  "The present constitution is a reactionary measure framed just after the war and too much in accord with the carpet-bagging enthusiasm of that period.  It allows the negro rights which he is in no condition to accept and which result in an injury to the state and to all concerned.  The proposed constitution will place upon the ballot the restraint of an educational qualification, or a property qualification, or both.  The provision will probably be made that a man must be able to read and write and expound intelligently the constitution before he shall be eligible to vote.  It may be added also that he must be possessed of from $200 to $500 worth of property to enjoy the privileges of the ballot.  Thus, the negroes will be kept from the possession of the offices in the outlying districts of Louisiana, in some of which parishes they outnumber the whites by eight and nine to one.  In the whole state they are only slightly in the majority, but the proportion of 225,000 whites in New Orleans to 75,000 blacks leaves them heavily in the ascendancy in the planting districts.</p>
                            <p>"In regard to the changes which will be made in the judicial system we expect that the whole plan will be revised.  As the state courts are at present constituted they are most expensive and cumbersome.  We have five supreme judges at an annual salary of $5,000 each, twelve appellate judges drawing $4,000 each and a large number of district judges with a yearly salary of $3,000, bringing a total yearly expense to the state of $250,000.  The new plan contemplates the abolition of the appellate courts, when more business will fall upon the district courts, which will be enlarged.  A probable educational feature of the new constitution will be that each school district will be empowered to vote taxes for the education of its children.  It does not enjoy this privilege at present and districts which include an almost entire colored population are maintained by the taxes of outside taxpayers.  Besides these there will be many less important changes, as for instance, the name of our 'parishes,' which is the old French term for 'counties.'  The designation was first applied about 1840 and will now probably be changed to the modern title."</p>

                            <p>The railroads of the country, and especially those running into Omaha, are taking hold of the advertising of the exposition with a vigor which is bound to carry the news into every household within hundreds of miles of Omaha, that the greatest exposition this country has ever seen is to be held in Omaha during the summer.  These roads are clamoring for advertising matter and requests are pouring into the office of the Department of Publicity and Promotion for the handsome framed posters which are designed to be hung in offices and hotels, and for pamphlets and other advertising matter, as well as for cuts of the buildings, which are to be used in the advertising matter issued by the roads.</p>
                            <p>The latest folder issued by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company contains eight pages which are devoted to the exposition, including a nine-inch cut of the official bird's-eye view of the grounds.  These folders are distributed all over the country in the railway stations and in places frequented by the traveling public.</p>
                            <p>The Wabash road devotes two pages in its latest folder to exposition matter, including cuts of the buildings, etc., and has applied for sixty of the large, framed posters, which it proposes to hang in its stations all along its lines and in its offices.</p>
                            <p>The Chicago &amp; Northwestern road is about to issue several hundred thousand vast pocket memorandum books, in which several pages will be devoted to exposition matter, cuts of the buildings, a map of Omaha and copious information concerning the city.</p>
                            <p>The B. &amp; M. road is about to issue a new official wall map, showing its lines and this will be flanked by half-tone cuts of the exposition buildings.  Thousands of pamphlets are being distributed all along the lines of this road.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commissioners Will Meet Some of the Agricultural Society Men.</head>
                            <p>Next Monday morning George R. Williams, Bennington; J. R. Watts, Waterloo; Andy Kewitt and Omar Whitney of Omaha, a committee from the Douglas County Agricultural society, will meet the county commissioners for the purpose of  conferring relative to the appointment of a commission to gather and look after a Douglas county agricultural exhibit for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>In reference to Douglas county and the exposition, the commissioners say that they are doing all that lays in their power to advance the interests of the big show.  Chairman Kierstead says that of the $100,000 voted at the last election the county has turned over $50,000, and that the $25,000 will be paid as soon as the exposition people comply with the terms of the resolution adopted by the commissioners some time ago.  "That resolution," said Chairman Kierstead, "provides that $10,000 additional will be turned over when the Horticultural building is under roof, $6,000 when the stock and poultry pens are built, $1,500 when the Apiary building is completed and $2,500 when the Dairy building is under roof.  The remaining $5,000, held back for maintenance and beautifying the grounds, will be paid when the county commissioners see fit to draw the warrants."</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the balance of the proceeds of the bond sale, Chairman Kierstead said:  "I don't think that we shall turn this money over to the exposition association.  We will need this money in gathering and placing the Douglas county exhibit, and I consider it no more than right and just that we should hold it and expend it ourselves."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Directors of the exposition was held yesterday afternoon and was a very animated proceeding.  The financial question formed the most important feature of the meeting and it was decided that all subscribers to exposition stock to the amount of $500 or over who are delinquent on their payments in thirty days from this date and who are not "judgment proof" shall be sued for the amount of their subscriptions remaining unpaid.  Smaller subscribers will not be allowed to escape the payment of their subscriptions and they, too, will be made to feel the weight of the law if they persist in remaining delinquent.  A committee was appointed to visit the county commissioners and endeavor to persuade that body to pay over to the exposition the remainder of the $75,000 which it agreed to devote to assisting in the construction of buildings and preparation of the grounds.  The charge was made that the Auditorium building on the exposition grounds is unsafe and liable to collapse when filled with a crowd and the architects-in-chief were directed to make a thorough investigation at once and report on the condition of this building.   The matter of appointing a director general, or some other officer having general direction of the work of all departments of the exposition, was brought up, but no action was taken because so many of the members of the board had withdrawn on account of the lateness of the hour, that there was no quorum.  The advisability of calling a special meeting to discuss this question was considered and this will probably be done.</p>
                            <p>Nearly an hour was consumed in waiting for enough members to put in an appearance to constitute a quorum and when the meeting was finally called to order there were twenty-seven members present.</p>
                            <p>Reports of departments were the first thing in order and a financial statement was read by Secretary Wakefield, showing that collections since February 1 amounted to $14,385, making the total collections to date $318,573.  The total amount of cash on hand was given as $49,600 and the total disbursements as $366,000.</p>

                            <p>Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department called attention to the urgent need of money and offered a resolution calling upon the Board of County Commissioners to turn over without further delay the amount of $100,000 voted by the people of this country in aid of the exposition, which the board had agreed to contribute as the county's share of the expense of preparation.  Mr. Lindsey referred to the situation which confronts the exposition and said the money is badly needed.</p>
                            <p>Director Hibbard had the impression that it was designed to persuade the county commissioners to turn over the full amount of the proceeds of the bonds and said he was opposed to this, because he had worked for the passage of the bond bill in the legislature and had told his friends that the proceeds would be devoted to showing the resources of Douglas county.</p>
                            <p>It was explained that it was not the intention to ask the county commissioners to turn over all the proceeds, but simply the part that had been covered by the resolution adopted by them some time ago, providing for transferring $75,000 to the exposition to aid in the erection of certain of the buildings and preparing the grounds.</p>
                            <p>After some further discussion to the motion was withdrawn and a committee of five was provided for, this committee to visit the commissioners and endeavor to accomplish the purpose covered by the resolution.  The president appointed as this committee Directors Hibbard, Wharton, Webster, Lyman and Carpenter.</p>
                            <p>The discussion of finances being in order, Director Manderson said some radical action must be taken to compel those people who had subscribed large amounts to the exposition and who were able to pay, but who refuse to do so, to pay up and bear their share of the burden.  He moved that the chairman of the Ways and Means department be instructed to commence suit within thirty days against every subscriber of $1,000 or over who is, in the opinion of the chairman, good on execution and who is delinquent at the expiration of the thirty days.</p>
                            <p>In the discussion which followed this motion the amount was changed to make the amount $500 or over and was adopted in this form.  There was no opposition to the motion and Manger Lindsey said he would apply the same rule to subscribers of smaller amounts where such action seemed advisable.</p>

                            <p>This ended the financial discussion and the Department of Publicity and Promotion was called for.  Manager Rosewater made a verbal report of the working of his department, saying that when the Promotion department was placed in his charge but four states in the transmississippi region had appointed commissions and none of the eastern states had taken action.  Since that time he said all of the transmississippi states except Washington and Oregon have commissions actively at work, and of the territories New Mexico has an active commission and Arizona will probably be organized within a short time.  An agent of the department has been sent to Washington and Oregon and returns are expected from those states shortly.  Of the states outside the transmississippi region Mr. Rosewater said Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, West Virginia and Wisconsin have commissions actively at work, and the governor of New York is now preparing to appoint a commission of prominent business men, the governors of Tennessee, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are greatly interested in the matter of having their states represented, while the indications are

                            favorable for Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and other states taking energetic action in the near future.  Mr. Rosewater said he was convinced that when the exposition opens there will be fully thirty-five states represented, and he reminded the board that this was about ten more than were at the Centennial exposition in 1876.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the publicity portion of his department, Mr. Rosewater referred briefly to the articles which have appeared in the big eastern illustrated papers and magazines and the amount of news matter regarding the exposition which has appeared in the newspapers all over the country.  He also spoke of the arrangements which have recently been made with persons of great prominence to write exposition articles which will appear in the great magazines.</p>

                            <p>For the Department of Buildings and Grounds, Manager Kirkendall submitted a written report, showing the progress of the work on the buildings and grounds, and the condition of the several buildings at this time.</p>
                            <p>When this report had been read Director Youngs caused a sensation by stating that he had been informed, by what he considered a good authority, that the Auditorium building on the exposition grounds was not properly constructed, and that it would not be safe to allow a crowd to enter the building for fear of it giving way.  He said he believed that the building should be thoroughly examined before the construction had proceeded any further and every weak part strengthened in order to remove any suspicion of weakness.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall was on his feet in an instant to demand who had made such a statement.  He said he had heard such a report and had made an examination with the assistance of Inspectors Tamm and Baker and had found the building entirely safe.</p>
                            <p>A dozen of the directors asked for the name of Youngs' informant, and he announced that Inspector Baked had told him about the condition of the building.</p>
                            <p>"That man is not fit to be in our employ a minute," exclaimed Manager Kirkendall, hotly.</p>
                            <p>"Hold on!  Wait a minute!" exclaimed General Manderson.  "I think a man is to be commended for making known such an important state of affairs, instead of condemned.  Let us look into this thing.  We cannot afford to allow any doubt to exist regarding the stability of a building which may be crowded with thousands of people.  It might result in injuries to people which would cost the exposition thousands of dollars in damages."</p>
                            <p>When quiet was restored the matter was discussed calmly and it developed that Director Youngs had his attention called to the condition of the Auditorium and he had gone direct to Inspector Baker and demanded to know what he thought about it.  Mr. Baker had told him that he considered certain portions of the building weak and unequal to support a heavy crowd.  This had occurred about six weeks ago and it was stated that certain changes had been made in the construction of the building which might cover the defects spoken of by Mr. Youngs.  In order to make certain that there was no weak spots left untouched, a resolution was adopted, calling upon the architects-in-chief to at once make a thorough inspection of the building and report the result to the executive committee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXHIBITS AND CONCESSIONS.</head>
                            <p>Manager Bruce submitted a written report of the Exhibits department, reviewing the work of that department since the last meeting of the directors.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed made a brief report of the operation of the Concessions department, saying contracts have been made for the following:  Scenic railway, to James A. Griffith; wild west show, to Mattox &amp; Root; trained animal show, similar to Haegenbeck's at Chicago, to E. H. Sprague, A. J. Love and other Omaha parties; messenger service, to American District Telegraph company; official guide to Megeath Stationery company.  He said that of the 4,500 lineal feet on the Midway there have been let concessions which will occupy 2,500 feet, leaving 2,000 feet, the income from which to date was $23,000.  A number of concessions are under consideration and will be closed within a short time.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock made a brief statement of what had been accomplished by the Transportation department, saying favorable rates had been made on all railroad and steamship lines.</p>
                            <p>This disposed of all the departments, and Manager Rosewater brought up the matter of the appointment of a director general of the exposition.  He made a forcible argument, showing that the time has come when such an office should be taken without unnecessary delay.  He reviewed the conditions existing and asserted that no exposition has ever been successfully conducted without that form of organization.</p>

                            <p>Manager Kirkendall took Mr. Rosewater's statements as personal and declared he was ready and willing to resign, and offered to double his subscription if he was allowed to do so.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater denied any personal motive, but said the Buildings and Grounds department was the one most concerned at this time and a man should be appointed to take full charge.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Manderson asked if it had not been decided back in November that the executive committee should appoint a superintendent at $200 per month to take full charge of all work.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said nothing had been done under this resolution and there is no probability of anything being done.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Holdrege wanted to know if this matter was recommended by the whole executive committee or was recommended only by Manager Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey said he for one was opposed to a director general because the committee had carried the thing along to its present stage and a director general might make the exposition a failure and the committee would then be responsible.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Manderson called attention to the fact that there was no quorum present and nothing could be done.</p>
                            <p>A general discussion followed, in which Mr. Rosewater suggested a special meeting to consider the matter along with the water question.</p>
                            <p>Director Manderson and others admitted the force of Mr. Rosewater's arguments and said something ought to be done at once.  They insisted that the whole matter had been turned over to the executive committee and that body should act.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater insisted that the committee would do nothing.  It had left the matter to Mr. Kirkendall and he had refused for over three months to do anything, and in the meantime the matter was dragging along and things were getting badly mixed up.</p>
                            <p>As there was no quorum present nothing could be done and the meeting dissolved with the general understanding that a special meeting should be called shortly to consider this proposition and the water question.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Two Car Loads Coming to Look Over the Exposition's Prospects.</head>
                            <p>Colorado is the next state which will send a large delegation of her most prominent business and professional men to "spy out the land" and imbibe exposition enthusiasm, which is always on tap in Omaha.  This much was decided on at a meeting of the Colorado Exposition commission held in Denver Wednesday afternoon, it being decided that Governor Adams and Mayor McMurray of Denver should appoint representatives of that city and state sufficient to fill two special cars, and W. F. Bailey was appointed to make the necessary arrangements for the transportation of the party.  According to the program, as far as arranged, the party will leave Denver in the afternoon of some day to be determined on later, and reach Omaha the next morning.  They will remain in Omaha until the afternoon trains leave and reach home the next morning.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Ward and Secretary Macdonald, who visited Omaha last week, filled the Denver people with enthusiasm regarding the exposition, and the rest of the state and Denver commissions are anxious to come and see what is being done.</p>

                            <dateline>SUNDAY WORLD-HERALD:<lb/> OMAHA, FEBRUARY 13, 1</dateline>
                            <head type="main">WARNING TO THOSE LOOKING FOR JOBS</head>
                            <p>To even a casual observer Secretary John A. Wakefield of the Trans-Mississippi exposition has of late been showing evidences of a mental strain of no mean caliber.  The secretary's friends have noticed that he seemed not only to have constantly that tired feeling, but his hair and flowing facial adornment were becoming rapidly streaked with white.  In a man of the youth and energy of the secretary this seemed to quite a number as a sort of phenomenon, and during a serious conversation the other night by a party of his more intimate friends upon the cause of this change, it was decided that the writer should see Mr. Wakefield and try to obtain from him the cause of his apparent breaking down.</p>
                            <p>A few days later the writer called at the secretary's office, and seeing, when he entered the room, that Mr. Wakefield was busy, he seated himself where he could quietly watch the object of his anxiety.</p>
                            <p>In a few moments there entered the room a gentleman with a ministerial looking makeup, who inquired directly for the secretary, and, approaching that gentleman, he said:  "I beg your pardon, but I am the Rev. Samuel Oscott.  You have heard of me, no doubt.  I came to ask if you could kindly intercede for me, that I may be better able to support my large and rapidly growing family.  Down at Hoetown we had it on good authority that you were the man who gave out the situations at the great and glorious demonstration of the power of mind over matter that will form a portion of the attractions at Omaha the coming summer, or words to that effect, and, as I am an able receiver, I thought I would like some position at your show where my great powers of manipulating the nimble nickel, whether it be in the plate or in the box office, could be more thoroughly demonstrated.  And&#8212;" Here the Rev. Oscott noticed for the first time that Mr. Wakefield had made his escape, and, as one of the office stenographers politely told the representative from Hoetown that he had better write out his application and send it in in the regular way if he wanted to be next on the list of applicants, the gentleman faded out of sight, and from the recesses of a dark closet there came in view the familiar figure of the secretary, with a look upon his visage which spoke louder than words: "Is it gone?"</p>
                            <p>Hardly had Mr. Wakefield taken his seat before in came two lads, evidently from the country side.  They immediately came to the point and filed verbal applications for positions as ticket sellers at the gates of the big show.  They started in to expand upon their aptitude for the coveted places and had gotten as far in their family history as a story about the settlement of their grandfather upon certain broad acres to the westward before the security of the closet referred to hid the secretary from their view.</p>
                            <p>In the course of half an hour the same scene was repeated nineteen times, and as soon as the soft or irregular footsteps of a stranger were heard along the corridor the dignified secretary would make a spasmodic motion toward the closet.</p>
                            <p>Between Mr. Wakefield's desk and the dark closet opposite the floor was worn so that the workmen were compelled to relay it with sheets of steel.</p>
                            <p>When the writer was able to enjoy a quiet talk with the secretary it was after closing hours and at his suggestion the doors were shut and locked.  Then the secretary told of how the scene just described occurred daily, and that instead of letting up it was rapidly growing worse.  There were hundreds of thousands of thousands more application than there were places to be filled, and every applicant for a position claimed to be particularly adapted for the place aspired to.  Men, women, children, wives, mothers, sons, daughters, aunts, cousins, sisters, brothers, fathers and mothers'in-law, brothers and cousins-in-law, cousins-german, widows (both grass and otherwise), came with virtually the same story, until his slumbers and awakenings were so confounded and disarranged that his lifeblood was gradually being sapped by the awful strain and his inability to rest.</p>
                            <p>Thus was discovered the wherefore of the secretary's premature decline, and the matter was laid before the executive committee at the meeting Friday.  Heroic action by them was at once decided upon, and as a result the secretary's office has been supplied with the very latest appliances for handling applicants for positions, which is said to be in every way an improvement upon the device now in use at the White house in Washington, D. C.</p>
                            <p>Trial of the machine was had Saturday upon an applicant for the position of whipper-in for the exposition.  When the man showed his hand he was immediately <choice><sic>siezed</sic><corr>seized</corr></choice> by an arm of the machine, lifted up through an aperture in the roof and hurled into space in the fraction of second, where, according to the most reliable authorities, he is making records at traveling which the oldest inhabitants on the planet Mars have never seen anything to equal.</p>
                            <p>But Secretary Wakefield has been saved.</p>

                            <p>The statement made by Manager Kirkendall of the Department of <choice><sic>Bulidings</sic><corr>Buildings</corr></choice> and Grounds of the exposition, at the meeting of the Board of Directors last Friday when the charge made by Director Youngs regarding the Auditorium was under discussion, has had the effect of most effectually sealing the mouths of all employes of that department and they are afraid to allude to anything that is not exactly "according to Hoyle."  At that meeting, when Director Youngs said that Inspector Baker had told him the galleries of the Auditorium were weak, Manager Kirkendall jumped to his feet and shouted, "That man is not fit to be in our employ a minute!"  The other employes in the <choice><sic>depatment</sic><corr>department</corr></choice> are "not so slow," and they have accepted this statement at its face value and wisely keep their own counsel regarding the things they see.</p>

                            <p>While this embargo applies to those who are in the employ of the department, there are numbers of people who are in positions to know what is going on, but who are not compelled to "keep it dark" for fear of being discharged.  Some of these assert that it is not alone in connection with the erection of the buildings that some peculiar conditions have been noticed but they call attention to some of the strange proceedings in connection with the landscape work on the grounds, which they say is somewhat remarkable, to say the least.</p>
                            <p>A well known florist of this city, who has taken a great interest in the preparations being made  for beautifying the grounds, from the nature of his business, calls attention to some of the things which have been done, which he says indicate that things are running at loose ends.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ULRICH'S DIRECTIONS IGNORED.</head>
                            <p>"You will remember," said this florist, "that Rudolf Ulrich, one of the foremost landscape men in this country, was engaged to supervise this part of the work.  It is not necessary to refer to the changes made in his plans by Geraldine and the manner in which Geraldine, or some one else, attempted to get rid of Ulrich, but matters were finally fixed up about the time Geraldine 'resigned' and work was commenced on the bluff tract.  Ulrich took charge of this work and laid out plans and gave explicit instructions just how the work was to be done.  Then he went away with the understanding that he was to come back in about three weeks and supervise the transplanting of the big trees which are now standing along either side of the main promenade on the bluff tract.  He did not come and no one seems to know whether he is coming again or not.  I know, however, that his instructions have not been followed and the work has been done in a careless ignorant and slipshod manner.  If those big trees live through the summer it will be nothing less than a miracle.  They were not handled according to Urich's instructions, or according to the method employed by any reputable florist who knows his business.  They were set out under the direction of a man named Hadkinson, who was brought to Omaha from Lincoln.  I understood he acquired all his knowledge of tree planting from books and is a theoretical florist.  He is in charge of the landscape work and I suppose he has been putting some of his theories into practice.  The big trees were planted in holes about six feet in diameter and about five feet deep.  Hadkinson had them filled in with live horse manure and the trees were set in this and then covered with the same material.  Everybody knows that this kind of dressing is extremely hot and the result has been that these trees have "bled" nearly all winter; by that I mean that the sap has been running out of the ends of limbs where branches were cut off.  How a tree is going to live without sap is a mystery to me."</p>
                            <p>There are a great many other things about the "landscaping" of this tract which have excited remarks from people who have very little knowledge of such matters, but whose curiosity has been excited by the methods employed.  For instance, the full force of the gardener's department was employed for two or three weeks last October in sowing blue grass seed on this tract, a space of about twenty acres, the average being about 135 pounds to the acre.  A competent florist who was asked about the matter said that fifty pounds to the acre would be a liberal allowance.  But that is not so material as is the fact that there is scarcely a spear of grass to be seen at this time.  The seed sprouted in the fall, but it was sown so late that the frost killed the tender shoots and there is absolutely nothing to show for the trouble.  Besides this, roadways have been graded through this tract, buildings have been erected on it and material of all kinds has been piled all over the ground, so that it would have been impossible for any grass to grow on the tract if it had been started a year before.  The money spent for seed and the wages of the men who sowed it have therefore been entirely wasted and still there is no grass.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mr Baker's Letter to Mr. Kirkendall Calls Out a Hot Shot.</head>
                            <p>OMAHA. Feb. 14.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  In your Sunday issue I see published a letter from Inspector Baker to Mr. Kirkendall, manager Grounds and Buildings department, in which he denies ever making a statement to me in regard to the strength of the Auditorium building.</p>
                            <p>I have no wish or desire to do Mr. Baker an injury.  At the last meeting of the directory, after Manager Kirkendall reported on the condition of the different buildings, I considered it my duty as a director to call attention to what had become a common rumor, and which had been verified, in respect to the faulty construction of the Auditorium building.  I requested that the matter be looked into and if the building be found in a safe condition there would be no harm done; if found as reported, it could be placed in a safe condition before serious damage was done.  Instead of taking these remarks in the proper spirit, Mr. Kirkendall got excited and demanded to know the name of my authority.  On learning that it was Mr. Baker he jumped to his feet and exclaimed: "That man is not fit to be in our employ."</p>
                            <p>Are we to understand from this that men employed in the Department of Grounds and Buildings are under instructions to "keep it dark," and that their situations depend on their following these instructions to the letter?  That certain members of the directory are barred from receiving information except such as is doled out at the pleasure of the heads of the departments?  The developments in this case seem to point that way, for the next morning after the directory meeting Mr. Baker is "called down," and then appears his letter to Manager Kirkendall&#8212;which is kindly given to the press&#8212;in which my veracity is called into question, and which leads me to make this statement.  Several rumors had reached me as to the instability of the Auditorium building and on the morning of January 12 I met Mr. Baker with Mr. Rosewater in the business office of The Bee.  Mr. Rosewater was discussing the advisability of a director general and enumerated cases where money had been wasted through the lack of a competent man in general authority on the grounds.  Mr. Baker made no dissent to these sentiments in the presence of Mr. Rosewater, but when Mr. Rosewater was called away the conversation was continued for some time between Mr. Baker and myself and was substantially as follows:  Mr. Baker said there was no need of a director general, that everything was working smoothly and there were good men in charge of the different works.  I then said:  "Mr. Baker, on your reputation as a builder, would you say that the Auditorium building is being properly constructed?"  He said:  "No, I don't, and I called their attention to certain things in regard to that building, but was told that Mr. Tamm would attend to that.  Afterwards Mr. Creedon, the contractor, came to me and wanted me to assist him in making certain changes to strengthen the gallery.  I told him I would have nothing to do with the building."  I am informed that Mr. Baker has said substantially the same to other parties also.</p>
                            <p>In Mr. Baker's letter to Manager Kirkendall he says:  "Those minor matters you speak of have been attended to, which make the strength of the gallery doubly strong."  This goes to show that there were defects and some one "of good authority" had pointed them out to Manager Kirkendall.  If these defects have been corrected there could have been no harm in bringing the matter up at the directory meeting and a statement to that effect by Manager Kirkendall would have quieted any doubt existing in the mind of the public.  I cannot see what good will result in the publication of a letter from an employe written under such circumstances.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Another Important Document Missing from the "White Cottage"</head>
                            <p>The "white cottage" on the bluff tract of the exposition grounds, which is being used as the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, seems to be a popular resort for sneak thieves.  Documents of various kinds have been in the habit of disappearing very mysteriously, and nobody seems to know what has become of them.  Under the custom governing the employes who use the office as headquarters the building is supposed to be occupied by some one at all times.  The night watchman is Joe Schwartz, a swarthy foreigner of uncertain age, who has been the body guard of Dion Geraldine for many years.  He was brought here from Chicago by Geraldine and put on the exposition pay roll as a "rod man," and so carried for several months, although he did very little work in that line, being employed as an errand bot and spy for Geraldine.  Since he has been acting as "watchman" for the cottage the place has been found deserted and the windows unlocked.</p>
                            <p>The latter part of last week the plan for the piling which is being done for the north viaduct across Sherman avenue was stolen from the white cottage and has not been found.  The plan showed the location of each pile and on it the engineer, who supervised the driving of these piles, has noted the data which shows the force required to drive each pile, from which data is obtained the amount each pile will bear.  This data had been duly entered on the plan for the information of the engineers and architects, but the entire thing has disappeared.  The responsibility for the loss has not been placed and no information is obtainable at the office of the department, all the employes being afraid to open their mouths.</p>
                            <p>This is not the first time data which might cause contractors a little more work has disappeared from this office, but no steps have been taken to prevent a repetition of the occurrence.</p>

He explained to the 2,000 members of the exchange the plan and scope of the exposition and made an urgent appeal to them to see that St. Louis was properly represented.</p>

                            <p>Vice President Charles R. Drake of Arizona territory writes to the Department of Publicity and Promotion from his home at Tucson that exposition matters are taking a more encouraging turn in his bailiwick.  He says that the action of the legislature in refusing to make an appropriation for representation at the exposition has served as a wet blanket on all efforts to arrange for an exhibit, but matters have received an impetus recently through the efforts of Governor McCord, who called the attention of the mining men of the state, at a recent convention held at Phoenix, to the fact that the territory would not be represented by any exhibit unless private enterprise took hold of the matter and made the necessary provision.  The governor suggested that the mining interests of the territory subscribe to a fund for making a collective exhibit of the resources of the territory and that an effort be afterward made to induce the legislature to reimburse the subscribers.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Drake says this suggestion of the governor is being agitated and he expresses the hope that something will come of it.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>There has been a great deal of talk, lately, about the "mystery" which is said to envelope the origin of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  Numerous claims have been made by various parties to the honor of being the first to conceive the idea of holding a great exposition at Omaha, which should exhibit to the world the resources of the great west.  These claims have been especially numerous since it has become apparent that the exposition is to be a most gigantic affair and a credit to the originator.  There are fully a score of men in Omaha who can relate authentic incidents showing where and when they conceived the idea that a great exposition should be held in Omaha and their claims are supported by circumstantial evidence that leaves little room for doubt as to their correctness, so that all that remains is to establish their relative dates and forever settle the controversy, on the theory that the man who first mentioned the matter and continued to <unclear reason="cut off"/></p>

                            <p>The greater number of claimants for the honor of being the progenitor of the enterprise base their claims upon incidents occurring just prior to the passing of the resolution by the Transmississippi congress, which called the exposition into being.  Some of these claims antedate the congress by a few days or a few weeks.  Among these later are ex-Mayor Bemis, R. W. Richardson and L. H. Bradley.  The two latter were appointed by Mayor Bemis as delegates to the meeting of the Transmississippi Commercial congress which was held in St. Louis in 1894 and were responsible for the selection of Omaha as the place for the meeting in 1895.  It was through the efforts of Mayor Bemis and these two delegates that the Commercial club was induced to take hold of the matter of making preliminary arrangements for the meeting of the congress in Omaha.  In November, 1895, just before the congress commenced to assemble, the idea of working up a sentiment among the members in favor of an exposition was discussed by these three and each is positive that he made the first suggestion.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WALSH'S EARLY IDEA.</head>
                            <p>James Walsh is another aspirant for the honor of being the originator of the exposition.  He was a delegate to the congress and in a caucus of Nebraska delegates the day the congress met he suggested the introduction of a resolution providing for an exposition at Omaha, the buildings to be permanent and the show to be held once every five years.  This suggestion finally culminated in the preparation of the resolution which was finally adopted by the congress, but the permanent features suggested by Walsh were eliminated.</p>
                            <p>At the last monthly banquet of the Commercial club President Wattles of the exposition said he had concluded, upon investigation, that Dudley Smith was entitled to the honor of originating the exposition, as he had suggested an exposition at Omaha while gazing upon the beauties of the California Midwinter fair at San Francisco during the winter of 1893-94.</p>
                            <p>This claim at once disposed of the later claims of Walsh, Richardson et al, although Walsh charges that Dudley Smith was not a member of the delegation to the Commercial congress and had absolutely nothing to say at that time about an exposition at Omaha and took no part in the discussion.  Whether this be true or false matters not, for the reason that before the sound of President Wattles' voice had died out, after giving Smith the credit, Secretary Wakefield of the exposition put in a claim which ante-dated that of Smith.  Secretary Wakefield related how, at the World's fair, in August, 1893, he was standing on the Midway Plaisance, talking with Allen B. Smith, Frank Brown and two or three other Omaha men, and the suggestion was made by some of the party, he is uncertain by whom, that an exposition would be a great thing for Omaha; that it would pull the money to the west instead of allowing it all to go east.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EARLIEST OF THEM ALL.</head>
                            <p>In the absence of any further showing this would entitle Secretary Wakefield, or some other member of the little party on the Midway at Chicago, to the palm, but all of these claims are swept aside by a claim which is several years older than the oldest of them and The Omaha Bee stands as the originator and consistent exponent of the exposition idea as relates to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The claim of The Bee dates more than ten years prior to the meeting of the Transmississippi Commercial congress in Omaha at which the exposition was given form, and the files of The Bee demonstrate the fact that to The Bee and its editor belongs the credit.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska State fair was held in Omaha from 1880 to 1884, inclusive, but was removed to Lincoln after the fair of 1884.  At the time of this removal there was a spirited controversy over the action of the State Board of Agriculture in taking the fair from this city and a series of editorials appeared in The Bee at that time, taking the position that the fair, as then conducted, was of no particular advantage to the city and advocating the establishment at Omaha of a permanent exposition.  There were a number of these editorials, appearing from time to time during the early part of 1885.  The first approved in The Bee of January 22, 1885, immediately after the meeting of the State Board of Agriculture at which it was decided to move the fair to Lincoln, and was as follows:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">THE STATE FAIR.</head>
                            <p>The State Board of Agriculture has decided to locate the Nebraska State fair at Lincoln for the next five years.  While Lincoln may congratulate herself upon her victory, we do not hesitate to express our gratification over the action of the board.  Omaha has outgrown all such artificial props as the State fair.  She has the location, wealth and population for a permanent interstate exposition.  Instead of contributing toward the enlargement, maintenance and repair of the buildings on the fair grounds she may as well devote her money and resources toward permanent exposition buildings, just as Chicago and other cities have done.  The Driving Park association should at once be merged into an exposition society, whose business it will be to provide the ways and means for collecting and exhibiting nor merely the farm products of the Missouri valley, but the products of our factories, packing houses, mills and breweries.  With the great cattle interests centering at our union stock yards, it will be an easy matter to organize an interstate cattle show in connection with the exposition, where the stock raisers of Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri may compete and participate.  The cattle brought to Omaha for the exposition may be marketed on the ground and the owners will, therefore, have a double incentive in bringing them here. * * * *  It is safe to predict that an interstate exposition such as we have outlined will not only be attended by thousands of Nebraskans where hundreds only would attend the State fair, but it will draw large numbers of people from all the surrounding states and territories.</p>
                            <p>The efforts of The Bee to establish an exposition in Omaha were not relaxed after the series of editorials referred to, but similar editorials appeared in the paper at intervals and Mr. Rosewater talked exposition to many citizens of Omaha.  His ideas and suggestions were in favor of an interstate exposition in which the states immediately surrounding Nebraska should be interested.  This idea was presented by him to George W. Lininger, as well as other people of prominence in Omaha, who recall the fact that such suggestions had been made from time to time.</p>
                            <p>In 1894 the last state fair was held in Lincoln.  The revenues of the board had fallen off very rapidly for the last three fairs and Omaha interests commenced agitating the idea of removing it to Omaha.  Committees were appointed and preparations were made to prepare a proposition to be presented to the State Board of Agriculture in support of the invitation to hold the state fair in Omaha.  At this time the following editorial appeared in The Bee in the issue of December 6, 1894:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">A POINTER TO THE COMMITTEE.</head>
                            <p>Before the committee appointed by the Commercial club, which is to report on the location of the proposed mile track and exposition grounds, takes action it would be well to consider the advisability and feasibility of location on one of the tracts recently purchased for park purposes.  Take, for instance, Miller park, which has as yet not been materially improved and cannot be made available as a competitor of Hanscom park.  Elmwood park or Riverview park for years.  Miller park is almost level and could be readily converted into a driving park, besides affording abundant space for exposition purposes.  If there is any need for additional ground on either side it can be secured by the right of eminent domain through the park commission at a fair price.  The probabilities are, however, that no additional grounds will be needed, except for railway approaches.  The roadway from the city to Miller park is a boulevard and if it was desirable the street railway would be extended from the fort to any point adjacent to the exposition grounds.  All the railroads can without a very heavy outlay extend tracks to points within easy reach.</p>
                            <p>Quite apart from the advantage to be derived from the fact that the city already owns this park and no taxes will ever be collectible thereon, there is the further incentive that all improvements can be made with a view to a permanent exposition or a zoological garden on the plan of Philadelphia and Cincinnati.  That would form an attraction all the year around and justify the acquisition.  In its present aspect Miller park appears to be a municipal tree nursery which can only be made an attractive park by the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
                            <p>To expend money on leased ground is a reckless waste, besides being a barrier to the erection of sightly and substantial exposition buildings.  The fact is every building for public use should be constructed with a view to stability and permanency.  Even if Omaha should not get the state fair this project is feasible and would eventuate in an interstate exposition of the first magnitude.</p>
                            <p>The opportunity for putting the exposition idea into practical execution was presented when the session of the Transmississippi Commercial congress was about to be held in Omaha in November, 1895.  This opportunity was taken advantage of and on the Sunday preceding the meeting of the congress, when many of the delegates were in the city and when the congress was the subject of much discussion, the following editorial appeared in The Sunday Bee of November 25, 1895:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">A TRANSMISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>The construction of the transcontinental railroads gave the first powerful impetus to the development of the transmississippi country.  Twenty-five years ago the population of the states and territories west of the Mississippi was 6,435,167, and the states and territories west of the Missouri were credited by the national census with a population of 1,492,896.  In 1890 the transmississippi states contained a population of the states and territories west of the Missouri aggregated 5,917,213.  In 1860 there were only twenty-one miles of railroad in the country west of the Mississippi.  Today the railroad mileage in the same region exceeds 65,000 miles, of which 37,000 miles are boasted by the country west of the Missouri.</p>
                            <p>The marvelous resources of this vast empire were only in a measure displayed at the World's Columbian exposition.  In fact, the exhibits of the western states and territories were to a great extent overshadowed by the international exhibits made at Chicago.  Of the hundreds of thousands of people who viewed the World's fair comparatively few carried away with them a distinct impression of the productive industries of the transmississippi states.  Even people who live in this section and who have contributed to its growth do not grasp their extent and magnitude.</p>
                            <p>The inspiration for the Cotton States' exposition now being held in Atlanta doubtless lay in the conviction that an interstate exposition would go further toward promoting the development of the south than any other single agency.  That the judgment of the projectors of the Cotton States' exposition was eminently sound is attested by the success that has attended this great undertaking as regards both the number and variety of the exhibits and the financial management of the venture.  Not only have the people of the cotton states displayed commendable zeal in contributing toward its success with displays, but several of the Atlantic states, notably New York and Pennsylvania, are creditably represented.  The Atlanta exposition has drawn hundreds of thousands of visitors from every section of the country and will be the agency by which a vast amount of new capital will be transplanted into the south.</p>
                            <p>What has been accomplished for the south by the Atlanta exposition can be accomplished for the west by a Transmississippi Exposition.  With a population of 15,000,000 to draw on and a country prolific in material wealth, a Transmississippi Exposition would be an assured success from its very inception.  Such an exposition would give the impetus to the westward trend of population and capital for which the people of this section have been striving.  It would make known to all the world the capabilities of the west and revive activity in every branch of industry and production.</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi congress, which convenes in this city during the present week, is the proper body to take the initiative in formulating the plans for a Transmississippi Exposition.  Its recommendation in this matter would have great weight with both the state and national legislatures.  Without disparaging any other city ambitious to secure the location of such an interstate exposition.  The Bee believes that the claims of Omaha are far superior to those of all other transmississippi points.  Its location in the heart of the continent, midway between New York and San Francisco, makes it alike accessible to people east and west.  Its railroad facilities in every direction are as perfect as those of any city in the Mississippi valley north of St. Louis.  It is the center of the great agricultural belt and within a day's reach, by rail, of the mining region of Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota, and within two days' reach of the great mining states west of the Rockies.  Omaha is as near to the Puget sound country as is St. Paul and nearer by 500 miles to San Francisco and southern California.</p>
                            <p>It is hardly necessary to add that whatever is required of Omaha or pledged for Omaha to make the Transmississippi Exposition a success the business men of this city will carry out to the letter.</p>

                            <p>On the recent trip of the "Chicago Special" from Omaha to Chicago The Bee reporter enjoyed the privilege of a talk with a number of people from various parts of the country regarding the Transmississippi exposition.  C. A. Cairns, assistant general passenger agent of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern said:</p>
                            <p>"While I do not attempt to deny that our interest in the exposition may have its selfish side, for the Northwestern will get even more than its share of the traffic, with quick time and improved train service, still we have in common with the rest of the western country, a real pride and pleasure in the affair.  The view I obtained of the preparations for this great event in Omaha was a genuine surprise to me, prepared as I was to witness the evidence of a stupendous undertaking.  Only those who have personally surveyed the site and the buildings in course of construction can fully realize the magnitude of the Transmississippi and International Exposition as projected by its ambitious management.  Every place I go I hear nothing but praise of the work and its promoters.  Omaha will become the show ground of America and cannot fail to reap a lasting benefit from this exposition, which will be second to nothing ever before accomplished on this side of the water, with the exception of the Chicago fair."</p>
                            <p>Many of the visiting newspaper men from the west, especially those from Denver, Leadville, Pueblo and other Colorado points, spoke in the warmest encouragement of the exposition and predicted its unqualified success.</p>

                            <p>Prof. W. A. Withers, director of the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment station located at Southern Pines, has applied for 800 square feet of floor space for an exhibit to be made by this institution.  The experiment station in charge of Prof. Withers is supported by the state and comprises an extensive farm at Southern Pines, on which experiments in agriculture are conducted on an extensive scale.  There are two departments, one devoted to vegetables and agricultural products and the other to fruits, etc.  These products are cultivated in the most approved manner and experiments are made with various kinds of fertilizers, different ways of cultivating, and all the other investigations in the line of improvement which are of such vital importance to farmers, but which no farmer has the time or facilities for investigating for himself.</p>
                            <p>The application for space in the exposition is endorsed by a number of eminent authorities in agricultural matters, who commend the work of this station in the highest terms.  Prof. F. E. Dawley, director of the Farmers' institute at Albany, N. Y., conducted under the <choice><sic>Departmnet</sic><corr>Department</corr></choice> of Agriculture of the state, writes to the exposition authorities that there is "nothing of the same character for American farmers, either state or national, and it is doing the work that could not be carried on by the farmers themselves."  Similar endorsements come from J. C. L. Harris, president of the Board of Control, which has charge of the station at Southern Pines; H. W. Collingwood, managing editor of the Rural New Yorker, a leading agricultural journal; H. E. Van Deman, former pomologist of the Department of Agriculture of the federal government; H. E. Stockbridge, professor of agriculture in the Florida Agricultural college, and Prof. B. W. Kilgore, state chemist of Mississippi.</p>
                            <p>This matter will be taken up by the executive committee at once and arrangements will probably be made for setting aside space for the exhibit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mr. Armstrong of Chicago Comments on the Local Situation.</head>
                            <p>William Armstrong, musical editor of the Chicago Tribune, spent yesterday in this city, vainly trying to secure an interview with Mr. Kimball, musical director of the exposition.  Mr. Kimball being in Lincoln he could not be seen.  Mr. Armstrong has been much interested in the musical department of the exposition, and expressed himself as greatly surprised that it should have no representative here in Omaha.  He was ready and anxious to give its plans publication in his paper and to aid in the upbuilding of the department in any possible way, but he could gain no information.  Late in the afternoon he received a call from Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department, and as the result of his interview was forced to conclude that almost nothing has been accomplished in preparation for the five months of musical entertainments to be begun the first of June.  Mr. Armstrong expressed himself as much disappointed at the prevailing condition of things and was apprehensive regarding the future.  He said:  "The exposition will be a wonderful show.  It will draw crowds from all parts of the United States.  It presents an opportunity for helping along the cause of music in this city and in this part of the country that will never come to it again; at least not while you and I are alive.  I have seen enough of your city to believe that it is interested in music and that it has an art future to build and to be proud of.  Now is the time to be up and doing.  The music of the exposition should have been organized six months ago in order to fully cope with the gigantic possibilities that then existed.  I am very much surprised to find the choral forces here in Omaha unorganized.  They should be in active rehearsal preparing to take part in the great festivals which might form one of the chief artistic features of the whole exposition.  At this late day surely not a moment is to be lost."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Armstrong returned to Chicago last evening, but will be in Omaha again later in the season, when on his way back from a lecture tour now being arranged to include the chief cities of the Pacific coast.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Manager Lindsey Announces His Intention on Stock Subscriptions.</head>
                            <p>Manager Z. T. Lindsey, who was instructed by the board of directors to take radical action against subscribers to large amounts of exposition stock who persist in remaining delinquent in the payment of the assessments on their stock, says that he will follow his instructions to the letter and will proceed to make preparations to commence legal proceedings at the end of thirty days against all those subscribers of $500 or over who have not paid their subscriptions in full at that time.</p>
                            <p>"The full amount of all subscriptions will be due and payable March 1," said Manager Lindsey, "and we need all the money we can get.  This is the vital point in the progress of the exposition and those people who subscribed for stock should come forward and pay their assessments.  We have gone along with the enterprise on the theory that these subscriptions were all as good as gold, and we must have the money to meet our obligations.  Up to this time our finances have been in excellent condition and the delinquency on the part of some of the subscribers has not delayed us, but the time has now come when we need every dollar of the money and we must have it.  I have not made a list of the delinquents since about the middle of January, and a number have paid since that time, so I am unable to state just how many are delinquent or the total amount of their subscriptions.  The greater part of the larger subscribers have paid all except the last two assessments, and many have paid only one or two assessments, and some have paid nothing at all.  They are people who are well able to pay and should be made to do well able to pay and should be made to do so.  I intend beginning action against all of these people who do not pay up between now and March 12."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Architects-in-Chief Have Nearly Completed the Necessary Details.</head>
                            <p>The architects-in-chief of the exposition are rapidly completing the drawings for the minor details of the exposition work which may be regarded as in the nature of finishing touches and the working drawings and specifications for this work will soon be in the hands of the Department of Buildings and Grounds and be advertised.</p>
                            <p>The two restaurants which will stand at the east end of the viaduct leading from the main court to the Bluff tract are completed and have been turned over to the department.  Advertisements for bid will be inserted in the papers at once, and the construction of these buildings will soon be commenced.  These restaurants will be tall structures, standing like sentinels at either side of the broad passageway across Sherman avenue.  The architecture will be in harmony with the classic beauty of the main buildings and the height of the buildings will make them a feature of the general effect of the east end of the main court, as seen from the west.  Each restaurant will comprise an enclosed portion on the lower floor which will be used as a dining room, above which will be a story open in all sides, the roof supported by classic columns, which will form a cool resort in the summer time, while above all will be a flat roof, suitable for a roof garden.</p>
                            <p>The working drawings for the south viaduct, leading from the main court to the bluff tract, will be completed early the coming week, and bids for the construction of this will be advertised at once.</p>
                            <p>The drawings for the Transportation and Agricultural Implement buildings are well advanced and will be completed by the last of the coming week.</p>

                            <p>The episode in the proceedings of the Board of Directors at the last meeting, in which Director Youngs charged that the Auditorium galleries were weak, has called forth a denial from the inspector whom Youngs named as his informant.  This denial was addressed to Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, who furnished the copy for publication.  It is as follows:</p>
                            <p>OMAHA, Neb., Feb. 12.&#8212;Mr. F. P. Kirkendall, Manager Grounds and Buildings Department, Omaha:  Dear Sir&#8212;Your communication received.  In reply, as to the strength of the Auditorium building on the exposition grounds, will say that I consider it perfectly strong and safe.  Those minor matters you speak of have been attended to, which make the strength of the gallery doubly strong.</p>
                            <p>Have never stated to Mr. Fred Youngs anything at all about the strength of the Auditorium or any other building on the grounds, and pronounce his statement false in every particular.</p>
                            <p>As to the sheathing boards on outside, will say that the specifications call for them to be placed sixteen inches on centers, and they are so placed.  Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p>Governor Clough of Minnesota is in favor of a state exhibit at the exposition by his state and says publicly that it was a mistake on the part of the legislature that no provision was made at its last session for such exhibit.  The St. Paul Pioneer Press of recent date prints the following interview with the governor on this subject:</p>
                            <p>"Personally, I think it was a mistake that the legislature did not appropriate a reasonable amount for an exhibit at the Omaha exposition.  Now, the situation is, shall we not make an exhibit?  It looks to me, however, as though certain individuals throughout the state were going to make an exhibit.  There is quite a feeling in that direction, and I hope they will succeed."</p>
                            <p>"If these individuals make an exhibit," asked a Pioneer Press representative, "will the state legislature at the next session reimburse them?"</p>
                            <p>"Well, that is a matter concerning which, of course, nothing authoritative can be said now.  Of one thing I am assured, and that is that the state should have an exhibit at the exposition.  It can scarcely afford not to do so, and, as I said, I think it was a great mistake that the money was not appropriated for that purpose."</p>

                            <p>The Idaho exposition commission has issued an address to the people of that state, asking their assistance in raising funds for making an exhibit showing the resources of the state.

It is estimated that $16,000 will be required for an exhibit and the people of the state are asked to contribute this amount, the commission expressing the opinion that the legislature will reimburse the subscribers at its next session.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Exposition matters have taken a new turn within the last twenty-four hours.  The action of the Board of Directors directing the manager of the Ways and Means department to commence suits against delinquent subscribers to exposition stock, coupled with the fact that the board took no action whatever in the way of making a change in the organization of the machinery of the exposition, has aroused the feeling of soreness and discontent which has been latent since Geraldine "resigned."  Many complaints against the management of affairs are again voiced on the streets and in business houses.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Board of Directors did not take any action on the matter of appointing a general superintendent or director general at the last meeting the feeling is almost overwhelming among the members of the directory that some office of this kind should be created and some able man appointed to the position at once.  The only reason action has not been taken before this has been a feeling on the part of some of the directors that the matter had once been referred to the executive committee and it might be construed as a reflection on that body to take the matter out of its hands at this time.  The directors are agreed that such an officer is absolutely necessary and they are not backward about expressing this opinion, but they differ as to the manner in which the condition should be brought about.</p>
                            <p>Hon. Alvin Saunders, the venerable resident vice president of the exposition, is most emphatic in his declaration that business prudence demands that there must be a "head" to the exposition.  "As matters are now," said the governor very emphatically, "no man appears to know whether a given matter comes in his department or not.  As a result it is impossible to get a decisive answer to any proposition.  I have had experience in this way and I know what I am talking about.  This thing cannot go along like this much longer without striking a snag, and we must have a head to it.  The executive committee should control this officer, but he should have full authority in matters of detail."</p>
                            <p>Director C. W. Lyman is equally emphatic in his opinion that a general manager of some kind should be appointed to take general charge of the work.  He is of the opinion, however, that the executive committee should determine just when this appointment should be made.  "If the committee wants to carry the load a little longer I don't believe the board should interfere with it.  There is no doubt in my mind about the necessity for having an officer to look after all the details and if I was on the committee I should want him right away, but I believe the committee is the best judge of when that time has arrived."</p>
                            <p>Director G. W. Holdrege said:  "I can see the necessity for a general manager, but I believe the executive committee should first take action in the matter as long as it has been referred to them."</p>

                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick, another director, said:  "If it is thought best to appoint a general manager it should be done at an early day so as to help the exposition and relieve the executive committee and he should report to them on all important matters every day.  While they would have control of all his actions yet, at the same time, so long as he conducted his departments with ability and honesty the chances are the executive committee would act towards him just as the directors act at present towards the executive committee.  The members of the executive committee have done a great deal of work, but it seems to much to ask them to follow out all the details to the end of the exposition, and I think that the appointment of a manager to execute their orders would be a welcome relief to all of them, and it certainly would be no reflection upon their ability or the work they have done."</p>

                            <head type="sub">CAUSE OF DISAFFECTION.</head>
                            <p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds is the one which has attracted the greatest attention on account of the nature of its work.  People who have any complaints to make do not mince matters, but make charges that are serious in their nature and indicate a looseness in the general conduct of affairs about the grounds that is somewhat surprising.</p>
                            <p>Among other things it is openly charged that Dion Geraldine is as much in control of the actual workings of the Department of Buildings and Grounds as he was in the palmy days when he signed himself, "general superintendent of the exposition."  A subscriber to exposition stock who would probably be classed among "the little fellows"&#8212;a mechanic who has occasion to visit the grounds frequently&#8212;told a representative of The Bee recently that Geraldine is as much in evidence as ever.  "He is on the grounds frequently," said this man, "and always has something to say about how this, that or the other thing should be done.  He makes his headquarters at the Dellone hotel and nothing is done on the grounds without his knowledge.  He pretends to be here to bid on exposition work and to support this pretense he put in a bid on the north viaduct across Sherman avenue.  That bid was based on figures made by H. W. Tamm, the inspector in the employ of the exposition who was put there by Geraldine.  Tamm figured too high, though, and Geraldine did not get the work.  This contracting is simply a blind, however, because Geraldine is a partner in certain concessions which will form prominent features of the Midway.  The whole thing is a close corporation and I don't feel disposed to pay my subscription as long as things go on as they have been going."</p>

                            <head type="sub">GERALDINE'S INFLUENCE.</head>
                            <p>A contractor who was standing by when these remarks were made joined in the conversation at this point.  "Geraldine is not only interested in concessions," said he, "but he is a partner in contracts which are now being carried on.  He owns part of the piledriver which this man Green is operating.  John Templeton also owns a part of this same machine and Green is simply a figurehead under the direction of Templeton.  Templeton is Kirkendall's chief clerk, but that don't prevent him from violating the rules of the exposition and owning an interest in the piledriving machine which gets all the work on the grounds.  Green makes out his payrolls and Templeton pays them with his personal check.  Geraldine doesn't appear on the surface of this deal, but when you remember that Green was brought out here from Chicago, where he was a plasterer, and put on the payroll at $3 per day and then suddenly blossomed out as a full-fledged piledriver with a machine and succeeded in landing contracts to drive piles when other piledrivers had already closed deals with these same contractors, you will see that he has pretty big pull.  I know of one case where a certain piledriver had made an agreement to drive the piles for a certain building and had his machine on the ground.  The contractor had a meeting with Geraldine downtown and the job was given to Green.  I know the contractor did not see Green, because Green was on the grounds all the time between the time when the deal was made with the first piledriver and the time when the contractor notified the latter that he had decided to give the job to Green.</p>
                            <p>As an evidence that Geraldinism controls the department, parties point to the fact that the men placed on the department payroll by Geraldine remain there, regardless of their competency, while those who are believed to be opposed to Geraldine's "peculiar" methods soon find themselves out on the cold world.  It is openly charged that the reason certain contractors are able to underbid all competitors on exposition work is that they are assured sham inspection and that they may use inferior material with impunity, while contractors who have no pull with Geraldine know they will be compelled to comply strictly with the specifications and use first-class material, costing a higher price.  Many instances are cited which go to prove that these reports are based on more than idle talk.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HAS TAKEN TOO BIG A LOAD.</head>
                            <p>Some of the stockholders who talk about these things blame Manager Kirkendall for allowing this condition of affairs to exist; others are more charitable in their remarks and freely exculpate Mr. Kirkendall from any blame for these conditions.  Among the latter is a director who was not present at the last meeting of the board.  "'Kirkendall is a most agreeable fellow," said this director, "but he is inclined to be somewhat irascible.  I have no doubt this is caused by the tremendous task he has assumed in addition to carrying on his large private business.  He is a first-class boot and shoe man and has made a great success in his line, but what does he know about architecture, hydraulics, electrical plants, water works, drainage, and the laying out of grounds?

                            A man may be a first-class business man, but might not be able to run a machine shop or a hotel.  The truth is, Kirkendall has taken a bigger contract than he is able to fill.  He cannot be expected to show everything and has had no experience in the building business or in the many other lines which his department covers.  I have watched matters pretty closely, and have known for some time that there was bound to be a big explosion.  I thought it would come at the meeting last Friday and that is why I did not attend, but the inevitable must come sometime and the sooner some man is put in charge of the whole business who thoroughly <unclear reason="torn"/>nds the details and can give all <unclear reason="torn"/> it, the better it will be for the exposition and everybody concerned."</p>

                            <head type="sub">ABOUT A SUPERINTENDENT.</head>
                            <p>In line with the statements of the director quoted above it may be stated that things have been at loose ends on the exposition grounds for a long time.  Just three months ago the directors authorized the executive committee to appoint a general superintendent of all the departments "who should be a practical builder."  The directors left the naming of this man to Manager Kirkendall, but no man has yet been nominated for the position.  About one week ago Manager Kirkendall notified the executive committee that he needed the assistance of his chief clerk, John Templeton, outside of office hours, and he asked that he be authorized to raise Templeton's salary to $125.  Some objection was raised to increasing Templeton's salary again, as it had been twice raised already; once from $75 to $90 and then to $100, but the authority was finally granted.  The next day Mr. Kirkendall appointed Templeton "superintendent of the Department of Buildings and Grounds," and notified the various inspectors, engineers, etc., by letters addressed to each, that he was to be obeyed and respected accordingly.  This action brought on a controversy.  Mr. Kirkendall denied that he had made any such appointment.  Following this action the letters sent to the inspectors, engineers and other employes in charge of the different branches of work, notifying them of Templeton's appointment, were recalled by Mr. Kirkendall, and the following very adroitly worded epistle sent to each of them, dated February 9:</p>
                            <p>"I find it necessary to have someone on the grounds in whom we can center authority, and I have chosen Mr. Templeton in this capacity; so you will please report to him in all matters and receive from him such instructions as you may require from time to time.  I wish you to understand by this that Mr. Templeton will have authority to answer for me on the grounds, relative to all matters pertaining to the various departments."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CENTRAL AUTHORITY BADLY NEEDED.</head>
                            <p>Previous to having a man in whom to "center authority" the affairs of the department had been in the hands of everybody connected with the work.  Each inspector was supreme, likewise the engineer, the gardener and all the other employes who had the shadow of authority over any other person.  The inspectors followed the whims of their own sweet wills, the engineer went ahead with his work regardless of the consequences, the gardener conceived schemes and carried them out without knowing or caring how they fit the whole scheme, and nothing but "bull-headed luck" kept things running at all.  Even the man who is hired to watch the "office" at nights&#8212;another importation of Geraldine's, by the way&#8212;went away at night whenever he felt disposed, without securing the doors and windows.  These have been found open by other employes, and various documents which would be of interest to certain parties have been missing.  Of course no one reported these things, because every employe had always before him the awful fate of one of their number who conceived the idea that as long as he was on the payroll he ought to take as much interest in seeing that the exposition was protected as though he was the director of the department.  Acting on this theory he reported some of the higher employes who had "looked on the wine when it was red," and were not attending to their duties.  He was discharged almost immediately, and none of the other employes have experienced any desire to follow his example.  They recognize the fact that complaints are not wanted, and they act accordingly, but this knowledge does not keep them from talking to others about the way things are being carried on.</p>
                            <p>These are some of the things the subscribers are talking about these beautiful winter days, and there are enough other details just as freely discussed to make a good sized book.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Officers Elected and Plans for the Summer Generally Outlined.</head>
                            <p>The Traveling Men's Transmississippi club held its annual meeting last night in the parlors of the Commercial club.  The annual election of the board of directors took place and these elected officers for the club.  Besides this business the club laid some plans for the entertainment of traveling men who visit the city during the exposition which is the main object of the existence of the body.</p>
                            <p>The election of directors resulted in the selection of the following:  Ed Drew, W. H. Butts, E. S. Streeter, M. Meyer, W. A. Stone, M. W. Rayley, C. W. Close, M. C. Howes, F. O. Fields.  This board later elected the following officers of the club:  E. S. Streeter, president; M. W. Rayley, vice president; W. H. Butts, secretary and treasurer; W. A. Stone, chairman of the Board of Directors.  The president and secretary were re-elected, having held their offices since the organization of the club.</p>
                            <p>The most important matter decided upon in connection with the exposition was that club quarters should be maintained.  They will be located in some prominent building and will be suitably fitted up.  They are to be opened up shortly before the exposition, and if they are found to be successful they will be maintained until its close.  All visiting themselves of the privileges of the quarters.  The Board of Directors will meet on next Friday to examine several suites of rooms and will then make the selection.  A suite on the first floor of The Bee building was very favorably mentioned.  It was determined to invite any and all traveling men's associations in the country to take desk room in the quarters.  This will be provided free of charge.</p>
                            <p>In order to raise the revenue for the maintenance of the quarters it was decided to make the dues of membership 50 cents a month.  The first dues will be collected on April 1, by which time it is expected that the quarters will be opened and can be used by the members of the club.</p>
                            <p>Some arrangements were made for an entertainment to be given in the parlors of the Commercial club either next Friday or Saturday nights.  The affair is to be of a social character.  A program of music and speeches will be arranged.  Later a banquet will be enjoyed.  The entertainment will conclude with a dance and a card tournament.  The arrangements are such that it is expected that the affair will be highly enjoyable and successful.  Feminine friends of the traveling men will be invited to attend.</p>
                            <p>One of the very pleasant features of the meeting was the presentation of a handsome gold-headed cane to Secretary Butts as a mark of appreciation of his past efforts in behalf of the club.  The cane was purchased by the club membership.  The presentation speech was made by J. F. Hommel, who said in his remarks that the club members felt that Mr. Butts had done more than anyone else in building up the club.  Mr. Butts made a brief and feeling response.</p>
                            <p>The Traveling Men's Transmississippi club was organized in last November.  Its object is to promote fraternity and friendship among traveling men, to maintain club parlors for the use of its members and visiting traveling men and especially to provide headquarters and entertainment for all travelers' organizations and conventions meeting in the city during the exposition.  Among the conventions it will look after is the annual meeting of the Travelers' Protective Association of America.  The club membership is now 100 and it is expected that the 200 mark will be reached in the near future.</p>

                            <p>The joint committee on appropriation of the New Jersey legislature has agreed to report in favor of an appropriation of $20,000 for participation in the Transmississippi Exposition by that state.  The committee gave a hearing to Chairman R. M. Floyd and E. B. Gaddis of the New Jersey commission regarding the advisability of making an appropriation.</p>
                            <p>The committee did not approve of the scheme to erect a building at Omaha that might later be removed to Sea Girt, but thought it would be better to utilize the money appropriated to further the New Jersey exhibit.  The members admitted that something should be done for New Jersey manufacturers and trades people, and Colonel Floyd was asked to see to it that the state was well represented.</p>

                            <p>Mayor M. Alexander of Boise City, Idaho, one of the leading merchants of that thriving mountain city, was a caller at exposition headquarters yesterday.  Mr. Alexander is en route home from an eastern trip and stopped in Omaha at the request of Governor Steunenberg to look over the exposition grounds and look after Idaho's interests.  He learned what had been done by State Engineer Mills a few weeks ago and found nothing to add to what had already been done and spent the afternoon in looking over the exposition grounds.  He was greatly pleased at the progress which had been made and the magnificent scale on which the whole affair was projected.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WHAT THE DEPARTMENTS WILL SHOW</head>
                            <head type="sub">Justice Will Have Some Curious Articles and a Display of Justices and Decisions&#8212;Educational Bureau's Plans.</head>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion has received from Frank Strong, the representative of the Department of Justice on the board of control in charge of the exhibits to be made in the Government building on the exposition grounds, a brief statement descriptive of the exhibit which will be made by the Department of Justice in that building.  This description is as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Department of Justice cannot, from the nature of things, rank with the other and larger departments as an exhibitor, yet we hope to present several interesting features on the same or similar lines followed at the expositions at Chicago, Atlanta and Nashville.</p>
                            <p>The portraits of eminent men who have occupied the position of attorney general of the United States from the time of Randolph, in 1789, will adorn the available wall space.  As the law and Dame Justice herself are too intangible to be themselves presented, it will be necessary to show, in well bound calf, their printed edicts in the shape of statutes and supreme court reports, supported by the counterfeit presentments of well known judges, who for many years have leant dignity and honor to the bench and bar.  We also hope to have on exhibition a group of photographs consisting of the photographs of the justice, Hon. David J. Brewer, circuit judges and district judges of the Eighth judicial circuit of the United States, which circuit comprises the states of Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Arkansas, Wyoming, Utah and the territories of New Mexico, Oklahoma and the Indian territory.</p>
                            <p>We also expect to add an interesting branch in the exhibition of photographs of views connected with United States prisoners and prisons, showing the principal institutions where federal prisoners are confined, the modes of employment and discipline, together with souvenirs illustrative of the ingenuity of men when in confinement and compelled to rely upon their wits and native ability for amusement and such relief from the terrible monotony of prison life as can be gained by carving trinkets in wood and marble.  Keys, whittled from a broom handle, and which have actually been used by the marker to effect his release, dinner knives curiously made from small pieces of polished wood and horn, some the creation of Indian convicts&#8212;these and such like articles will, it is believed, prove interesting exhibits to everybody.  This feature will serve to illustrate the lives of those to whom justice has been meted out, a class of unfortunates growing larger and larger every year, and whose care, maintenance, proper punishment, treatment and general disposal furnish a subject for the best thought and wisest judgment of all good citizens and patriots.</p>
                            <p>It is also proposed to exhibit, nicely framed and properly and intelligently labeled, a series of blanks showing the routine of the business of the Department of Justice, such as the blanks used in the office of the attorney in charge of pardons, showing the routine of an application for executive clemency from the time of its inception until it is granted or denied by the president; blanks from the office of the appointment clerk, showing the various forms used in commissioning officials of the United States courts; blanks used in connection with the supreme court of the United States, etc.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion has also received from F. W. Clarke, the representative of the Department of the Interior on the Government Board of Control, a description of the exhibits to be made by that department.  From this it is gathered that this department will be represented by four of its bureaus, those of Education, Indian affairs, the Patent office and geological survey.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit of the Bureau of Education is mainly pictorial in character, illustrating the work of education, and wash drawings to illustrate various methods of punishment, the evolution of the modern school house, etc.  A prominent feature will be the work of the bureau in Alaska.</p>
                            <p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs will be largely confined to showing the work of the several Indian schools conducted by the government.  Specimens of work of the pupils in all lines will be shown, including carpenter and blacksmith work, shoemaking, tinware, wagons, harness, embroidery, bead work, etc.</p>
                            <p>The Patent office exhibit will include the usual exhibits of models of American inventions, classified in such a way as to show the influence of the Patent office on special lines of industry.</p>
                            <p>The Geological survey will exhibit minerals, fossils in rocks in great variety, a series of relief maps and geological models and framed illustrations from publications of the bureau.</p>

                            <p>A delegation of prominent business men from Arkansas, including members of the Arkansas Exposition commission and representatives of the newspapers of that state, will arrive in Omaha tomorrow, reaching the Webster street depot at 12:55 p. m.  It is expected that there will be between twenty-five and fifty people in the party.  They come to visit the exposition grounds and learn at first hands the progress that has been made and the general plan of the enterprise in order to act more intelligently in preparing for the exhibit which Arkansas is to make of her resources.</p>
                            <p>The visitors will be met at the depot by a special committee appointed for that purpose by President Wattles, as follows:  H. J. Penfold, W. D. McHugh, R. C. Peters, H. E. Palmer, G. W. Holbrook, H. K. Burket, Dudley Smith, W. F. Gurley, E. H. Scott, J. B. Sheean, R. W. Richardson, Euclid Martin and C. B. Havens.  This committee will escort the party from the depot to the exposition grounds, where the buildings will be inspected, and the entire party will then return to one of the hotels, where luncheon will be served.  President Wattles will represent the exposition, but the members of the executive committee will not be present, as the committee will be in regular session at the time.</p>
                            <p>The visitors will start for home in the evening.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition took steps at its meeting yesterday afternoon to provide additional room for the constant growing class of exhibitors who want to occupy space in the Manufactures building, by ordering plans drawn for an annex to the Manufactures building in which will be placed the foreign exhibitors.  This annex will stand to the west end of the big building, and will face west on Twentieth street.  It will be extended as far north as may be necessary and will afford plenty of room for all exhibits in this class which may be accepted.  The architects will at once commence the preparation of the plans for this annex and its construction will be pushed.</p>
                            <p>After wrestling with the matter for several months, the special committee of the executive committee, to which was referred the task of deciding upon the form of tickets, passes, etc., required for the exposition, submitted a report yesterday which was adopted.  The committee comprised Managers Lindsey, Kirkendall and Bruce, and Manager Reed acted with them for the reason that the Concessions department is more or less interested in the matter.

                            <head type="sub">Board of Trade Takes Hold of the Matter of Making an Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>The California Board of Trade has taken hold of the project of making an exhibit of the resources of the entire state and announces that it will take charge of the matter under certain conditions.</p>
                            <p>The board states that investigation shows that about $15,000 will be required to make a creditable showing, exclusive of any payment for space, and it will take hold of the matter provided the exposition authorities will donate 10,000 feet of floor space to the state free of charge and that the people of California will raise the necessary $15,000 by April 1.  If these conditions are complied with the board will proceed to make an exhibit which it is announced will include the following showing:</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;California's mineral resources, including all minerals found here which are used in the mechanics and the arts.  Second&#8212;Her building material, in woods, marble and stone.  Third&#8212;The capabilities of her resources.  Fourth&#8212;The full round of her agricultural products.  Fifth&#8212;A complete detailed presentation of her horticultural and viticultural products.  Sixth&#8212;Her illustrated geography, by means of relief maps.  Seventh&#8212;Her manufacturing capabilities and existing manufacturing industries.  Eighth&#8212;Her educational progress and advancement.  Ninth&#8212;The attractiveness of her natural scenery.  Tenth&#8212;The attractions of her health resorts.  Eleventh&#8212;The salubrity and clemency of her climate, as illustrated by ornamental and semi-tropical growth and as presented also in thermal statistics; and, finally, by proper statistical facts, her present status and past progress, and the advantages and inducements this state offered as a place of residence.</p>
                            <p>The people of Los Angeles county have raised $10,000 for making an exhibit of the resources of their county and the Southern Pacific railway has offered to transport exhibits to Omaha for about one-third regular rates on the going trip and return them free.</p>
                            <p>No official communication has yet reached the exposition authorities in Omaha regarding the suggestion of the State Board of Trade that 10,000 feet of floor space be given to California.</p>

                            <p>The greater part of the time and energies of the Woman's Board of Manager of the exposition is being devoted to getting out the children's paper which is to be issued on Washington's birthday, February 22, for the benefit of the Girl's and Boys' building.  The editorial and business staff of the paper, which was appointed some time ago, has opened an office in the Paxton block, and this is the Mecca of the members of the board and the numerous patronesses and the innumerable children who are contributing their services in many ways to help make the paper a success.</p>
                            <p>The design for the cover which will probably be accepted shows twenty small oval scrolls arranged in the form of a large oval covering the entire front page of the paper.  These are twined with cherry blossoms and in each little oval will appear the head of "somebody's little darling."  Just what will appear in the blank space in the center has not been definitely decided, there being a division of sentiment between an appropriate poem with etched illustrations and a photograph of a child.  One novel idea will probably be adopted because it is a direct violation of all the precedents is to omit from the cover of the paper the name of the publication.</p>
                            <p>Encouraging reports are being received daily from canvassers for the paper and the circulation manager is rejoicing over the prospect for a big circulation.</p>

                            <p>The statuary which is to add the finishing touches to the beautiful and stately Agriculture building is being modelled in this city by Sculptor Englesmann, who came here from St. Louis for that purpose.  The general character of the statuary was briefly outlined by Architect Cass Gilbert before he started for Europe, and this has been amplified by Mr. Kimball, of the firm of architects-in-chief.  From this data the sculptor is now making his clay models, which will be submitted for approval for work is commenced on the full size groups, which will appear on the building.</p>
                            <p>The central pavilion of this building will receive the greater part of the decoration.  Over each of the entrance arches will be spandrels ornamented with figures, while the pavilion will be surmounted by a number of groups.  Two groups will represent fountains, figures with water pots being emblematic of the rains which produce moisture for the ground.  The signs of the zodiac will also be represented by other groups.  Above all of these will be a large, central group, representing Prosperity, supported at either side by figures representing Labor and Integrity.  The wide frieze over the entrance arch will be occupied by a figure symbolizing Abundance, and at either end of the frieze will appear the arms of the state and the nation.</p>
                            <p>On the end pavilions will be groups representing the seasons, Spring, being depicted on the east end and Autumn on the west.  Reclining figures in these groups will represent the favorable winds.</p>
                            <p>Along the front of the building, surmounting the columns, will appear single decorative female figures, bearing cereals and other farm products.</p>

                            <p>A big delegation of Arkansas business men arrived in Omaha at noon today to make a thorough inspection of the exposition grounds and buildings and learn what has been done to make the Transmississippi and International Exposition a reality.  Before they return to their homes they will make arrangements for building an Arkansas building and installing in the main exposition building exhibits of the diversified resources of their state, which they say will equal anything that may be done by any other state in the union.</p>

Penfold and G. W. Holbrook.  A special trolley car was in waiting and in this the trip was made at once to the exposition grounds, where they made the tour of the grounds.  The visitors were most favorably impressed with the appearance of the buildings and the magnitude of the scale on which all the arrangements seemed to be projected.</p>
                            <p>After making a tour of the grounds the party was escorted to a hotel where luncheon was served, followed by short talks by representatives of the exposition and members of the visiting delegation.</p>

                            <p>"Our people are taking a great interest in the exposition," said Colonel Hambleton.  "I have been going about all over the state a great deal for the last few months, stirring up our manufacturers to make a good exhibit, and I find that they are all thoroughly alive to the situation.  The Illinois commission will not make any attempt to make a collective exhibit of the resources of the state, but devote its energies to social amenities after the exposition opens.  Before that time comes we will do everything within our power to have the resources of the state well represented.</p>
                            <p>"We have been making some preparations for the decoration of the interior of our building," continued Colonel Hambleton, "and it probably be ornamented with handsome pictures.  These will not be installed as exhibits, but will be simply for decoration.  Among these will probably be several large paintings of the World's fair, 10x20 feet in size, which were painted by Mr. Key of Chicago."</p>

                            <p>This morning the witness sworn gave testimony in regard to the receipts Hockenberger signed as secretary of the Board of Education for moneys received from himself as treasurer of Hall county, the state aiming to show that after taking $3,000 from the county treasury and giving a receipt therefor he only turned over to the school treasurer $2,000 and retained the $1,000, while secretary of the Board of Education.</p>
                            <p>The members of the County Commissioners' association of Nebraska met in annual session in this city this morning and transacted the preliminary business of the session.  A very disappointing feature of the affair is the fact that the members of the association of this county were not present to receive their guests and even when the delegates went to the hall they found it locked and no one present to attend to the matter.  The fault seems to lie entirely with the members of the Hall county board.  At the last meeting of the board it appointed a committee to receive the visitors and look after their entertainment every member of the board being a member of the committee.</p>
                            <p>Later in the day the members of the Hall county board arrived in the city and Chairman Ewing explained that owing to an oversight in the date of the meeting the reception committee had neglected matters.  He assured the visitors that the matter was deeply regretted and at once the local commissioners set about to make it pleasant for the delegates from other counties.  The visitors will be given a drive about the city tomorrow, including a visit to the sugar factory and Soldiers' Home.  The commissioners will finish they business tomorrow.</p>

H. Shoop and others from the force, in which Judge Scott had restrained the board from putting the discharges into effect.  The dismissal is asked for on the grounds that a levy has been made by the city council this year sufficient to maintain the entire force, and that the reasons for the discharge are no longer good.  The motion was submitted.Attorney Day objected to the motion and said it was important that the court make a ruling that might apply in future emergencies.

                            <p>FREMONT, Neb., Feb. 15.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;In the district court today the case of the village of Dodge against the bondsmen of their defaulting treasurer is in progress.  The claim is that Hoetfelker failed to account for $1,000 of the saloon licenses and $34 of other funds.  The evidence introduced today showed that he received $1,000 more than he had accounted for.  Hoetfelker was treasurer of the village of Dodge and also of Webster township, and a big man in that part of the county.  In October, 1896, he skipped out, owing a large amount of money aside from his indebtedness to the village and township.  His shortage with the county was settled by his bondsmen last fall.  His present whereabouts are unknown.</p>

The committee consists of seventeen members as follows:  James S. Sherman, chairman, New York; Charles Curtis, Kansas; Israel F. Fischer, New York; Frank M.

Lately Chairman Sherman has been talking against making any more appropriations for the Omaha Exposition and has been outspoken in criticism of the proposed congress, but the friends of the measure hope to reach the chairman in time to report the amendment favorably.  Congressman Lacey of Iowa is against the bill, which is exciting more comment than the opposition of any other member of the committee.</p>

                            <p>Either the commissioners of Douglas and Sarpy counties and the South Side Improvement club have been working on the boulevard between Fort Crook and Omaha, in a most mysterious manner, or else Captain Sam. R. Jones, assistant quartermaster, Department of the Platte, is just waking up from a Van Winkle sleep.  Captain Jones, in a letter to Congressman Mercer, states that he has received a communication from the quartermaster general of the army in relation to a macadamized road from the garrison to Omaha, but is not able to report on the same.  He asks Mr. Mercer who the promoters of the boulevard are and as he has consulted with several parties in Omaha about the matter and as no one seems to know anything about the contemplated work, he is constrained to ask Mercer for information so that he way reply to the quartermaster general's inquiry.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Cox of the government board said today that every department was actively at work assembling their exhibits for the Omaha exposition and that every member was enthusiastic in predicting the finest exhibition ever made by the government.  It will take fifty cars to transport the government exhibit, exclusive of tank cars to haul the salt water aquarium.  Representative Schneider of the Fish commission has returned from Omaha, where he went to locate the fish exhibit, and says he was greatly impressed with what he saw of the work being done.  Lieutenant Commander Logan will assume charge of the naval exhibit March 1, succeeding Lieutenant Commander Patch, who will be transferred to another station.</p>

                            <p>The Arkansas delegation laid siege to the <choice><sic>expoosition</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice> headquarters at an early hour and a lengthy conference was held with the officials of the Department of Exhibits.  As a result of this space, aggregating 12,000 feet, in the Horticulture, Mines, Agriculture and Liberal Arts, buildings was reserved for that state.  This space will be held <choice><sic>foor</sic><corr>for</corr></choice> Arkansas until March 1, by which time the commission will have decided whether to make the state exhibit in the several main exposition buildings or erect a building and install therein the many evidences of the resources of the state.</p>
                            <p>The members of the delegation gave vent to many expressions of firm determination to have a showing made by their state which shall be a credit, and they said they believed the revenue necessary to bring about this result could be raised without difficulty after they instill the people of their state with some of the enthusiasm they had imbibed since reaching Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The Arkansas party was increased this morning by the arrival of James T. Pomeroy of Eureka Springs, who stopped in Kansas City to attend the meeting of the Missouri Exposition commission and learn something of what Missouri intends to do.  Mr. Pomeroy asserted most positively that the northwestern part of the state where he lives will be represented by an exhibit regardless of what the rest of the state may do.</p>
                            <p>"Our section is thoroughly aroused," said Mr. Pomeroy, "and we are going to have an exhibit.  I accomplished the Missouri commission on its visit to Omaha and when I returned home and told our people of what the exposition was going to be they all agreed with me that we must make an exhibit and show the world what we have down there in the Ozark mountain country.  We have made arrangements to reproduce one of our famous mineral springs and keep it supplied with the natural spring water during the entire exposition and we are also going to have an exhibit of the fruits and other products which are grown in our section.  If the state makes a general exhibit we will join with it and do all we can in the interest of a fine exhibit."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Special Attention to Be Paid to Its Proper Presentation.</head>
                            <p>Prof. F. W. Taylor, who attended the meeting held in Chicago in the interest of a movement to increase the demand for American corn as a food product, has returned from that meeting greatly impressed with the magnitude of the undertaking.  He attended the meeting as the representative of the Department of Exhibits of the exposition and was largely instrumental in inducing the supporters of the movement to commence operations in Omaha by installing an exhibit at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Taylor stated that the meeting was attended by about 150 or 175 representatives of manufactories of corn products, superintendents of experiment stations connected with agricultural colleges, and others interested in increasing the demand for corn.  As a result of the deliberations it was decided to commence active operations at the Transmississippi Exposition by erecting a building to be decorated in a lavish but highly ornamental manner with corn, and install therein the various products made from corn, including the new corn flour about which so much has already been said and written.  In connection with this exhibit there will also be established a cooking school at which the methods of preparing edible and attractive dishes of corn products will be demonstrated, and the preparations distributed to the hungry.</p>
                            <p>Some time in October a meeting of the organization given birth in Chicago will be held in Omaha and plans will then be perfected for an active campaign of education among the people of the United States, including exhibitions at future expositions, and following with a descent upon the countries of Europe, including an exhibit at the Paris exposition in 1900.</p>

                            <p>The Philadelphia Item of recent date quotes Superintendent Kimball of the life saving service as saying that the display of life saving appliances at the Transmississippi Exposition will excel the one that attracted so much attention at the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>Everything that was at Chicago will be at Omaha, and there will be a number of new features.  An interesting feature of the exhibit will be a 24-pound shot, the first fired in the United States, to carry a line to a wrecked vessel.  It was thrown from an iron mortar to the British ship Ayrshire January 12, 1852.  The life savers, volunteers, rescued 201 persons.  Only one man was drowned, and he lost his life because he attempted to reach the shore by clinging to the outside of the car instead of awaiting his turn.  The shot that carried the line to the vessel crashed into the cabin, sunk when the wreck went down, and for a generation was uncovered with sand.  A great storm uncovered the wreck a few years ago; the shot was recovered and presented to Superintendent Kimball, who keeps it as a valuable souvenir of the service.  He also has the mortar from which the shot was fired, and both will go to Omaha.</p>

The little party started from Nashville last October, intending to come to Omaha by water, but when St. Louis was reached the severity of the weather and the frozen condition of the rivers made it necessary for them to abandon the water route and they and their boats were brought to Omaha by the more prosaic, but expeditious, railway.</p>

The committee was instructed, when appointed, to confer with the exposition authorities and learn definitely just what arrangements can be made as to space, the amount of space that may be secured in each of the main buildings, the conditions under which Missouri will be allowed to erect a state building and install therein its exhibits and such other information as may be necessary to a full understanding and intelligent decision.  The committee was not authorized to enter into any contract or bind the state commission.</p>
                            <p>Those constituting the committee are S. A. Stuckey of Carthage, chairman; G. W. Watters of Canton, W. W. Morgan of Kansas City, W. J. Rouse of Monroe City, J. W. Damel of Jefferson City, J. Milton Turner of St. Louis.</p>
                            <p>The members of the committee say there is no doubt about Missouri being represented at the exposition in the most becoming manner.  The state commission has already raised $26,000 for a state exhibit and building, and as much more is in sight, making it absolutely certain that the state exhibit will be a most creditable one.</p>

The committeemen say that a general lack of interest has been manifested by the people of northern California regarding an exhibit and the absence of any assurance that free space to the amount of 10,000 feet would be donated to the state by the exposition management combined to impel the committee to the decision announced.</p>
                            <p>In view of this termination of the spasmodic efforts of the San Francisco people, the state will probably be represented only by the county of Los Angeles, the people of that energetic county having already raised a fund of $10,000 for the purpose of making a fine exhibit of the fruits and other resources of that section.</p>

The exhibit will be in the shape of the Ryan collection of Indian curios, the largest collection of its kind in the United States, comprising, as it does, Indian relics, Bad Lands fossils, Black Hills rubies, wild west taxidermy specimens, wonderful petrifactions, beautiful minerals, magnificent beadwork, western curiosities of all kinds and a large collection of valuable ancient firearms, all collected in this city and vicinity by P. Ryan, while a resident of Chadron, during which time he has been employed as a brakeman on the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley railroad.  Mr. Ryan left with his collection for St. Joseph the first of the week, where he will remain with it until the opening of the exposition.  From a historic and educational standpoint the Ryan collection has no peer.  It comprises 5,000 pieces of Indian manufacture, covering every article made by the Sioux tribe, and is an object lesson representation of Indian life from the cradle to the grave.  Mr. Ryan's collection has long been an object of interest to every visitor to this city and was displayed in one of the largest shore buildings in the city.  One of the articles contained in it which is of more than passing interest is the ghost shirt of Big Foot, the leader of the Sioux uprising of seven years ago.  It is soiled and stained with blood, and was cut from Big Foot's body by Dr. J. H. McKnight of Long Pine, Neb., after it was cold and stiff in death on the battlefield of Wounded Knee.  There are war bonnets, beaded leggings, vests, sashes, squaw's dresses; in fact, every article of Indian manufacture.  In the collection of historical firearms, sabers and knives are some very valuable specimens, including some firearms about which are woven tales of daring and deeds of bravery on many battlefields in which the reds and the "paleface" waged war together.</p>

Like all the visiting delegations which have preceded them, they were literally carried away with the magnitude of the exposition, although their minds had been partially prepared for what was before them as they skirted the exposition grounds when entering the city via the Missouri Pacific railroad.  They will spend today in Omaha, making full arrangements for the exhibit which their state will make and selecting the location of the Arkansas building, a magnificent structure of native wood, stone and marble, which will be erected on the bluff tract as a home for the weary travelers from Arkansas who visit the exposition grounds and examine it in all its glory.</p>
                            <p>There were thirty men and one woman in the party, which arrived at the Webster street depot at 1:15 p. m. yesterday.  The woman was the wife of Colonel E. T.

He said he had greatly enjoyed going over the exposition grounds and confessed to the greatest surprise at the progress which was everywhere in evidence.  He promised his own hearty co-operation and pledged the assistance of his state.  He spoke of the diversified resources of Arkansas, including the most extensive zinc deposits in the world, virgin crests, iron, antimony, coal and many other minerals, and predicted that every member of the Arkansas delegation will return home fully determined that the state shall make a good showing, notwithstanding the last legislature made no appropriation for that purpose.  He promised an exhibit from that state which shall be a credit to the exposition as well as to the state.</p>
                            <p>Before taking his seat Colonel Vincenheller said that Governor Jones had wished very much to be of the party, but had been detained at home by the cares of state, but had sent along a representative in the person of the secretary of state, Mr. A. C. Hull.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GLORIES OF ARKANSAS.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles asked Mr. Hull to respond for the visitors as the representative of the governor.  Mr. Hull said he had been requested by the governor to prepare a few facts with which to regale the people of Omaha, and in order to do properly he said he put them in writing and would read them.  He prefaced his remarks as follows:  "We are here as representatives of a great state for a purpose.  We came in obedience to your very courteous and urgent invitation.  You had a purpose in inviting our commission to visit your elegant city and your grand and magnificent exposition in preparation.  You wanted Arkansas, with her varied and wonderful possibilities, added to your great enterprise, to the end that your exposition might be augmented in its attractions, and its success more complete.  Indeed may I not say your "show" would not be complete without Arkansas?  Again, we take, it, you wanted our state given a fair opportunity to be represented properly along with her sister states of the great transmississippi section.</p>
                            <p>I assure you, gentlemen, that we properly appreciate your kindly considerations of our interests, and also your very hearty reception of our commission and your characteristic western hospitality.  But with all this I want to say we are here for business as well as to enjoy your generous entertainment, and we are here to look after the interests of our state somewhat ourselves, and I am sure you will not think us selfish for that.  When we come to consider the possibilities of our state, its wonderful resources and its varied interests, we feel sure that we have nothing to lose, but everything to gain, by an exhibition of products at your coming exposition.</p>
                            <p>Arkansas has an area of 53,850 square miles.  The topographical features of the state present along its southern boundary an undulating, hilly country, timbered with pine, oak and hickory.  Going northward the surface is more and more hilly, although in central and northeast Arkansas are found large prairies.  Crossing the Ozark mountain region to the north the traveler finds himself in a hilly, broken country, 1,500 feet above the level of the country.  The large rivers, the Mississippi and the Arkansas, the one bounding the state on the east, the other dividing it almost in half, are navigable for steamboats.  White river, the Ouachita and Red rivers are navigable for quite a large number of miles each.  Railway transportation facilities have not kept pace with the progress of the country, being yet very inadequate to the development of our resources.  In other states the railroads have pioneered settlement and development and civilization; in Arkansas they have succeeded settlement, and up to the present time we only have about 2,600 miles of railroad within the state.</p>
                            <p>All the manifold resources of the great state as a cotton producing, lumber producing, mining, grazing and manufacturing section were set forth in detail, with figures to support the statements, many of which must have fallen with surprise on northern ears not accustomed to hearing the actual facts in regard to the commonwealth now taking on its second growth.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PEOPLE DOWN THEIR ALIVE.</head>
                            <p>R. W. Richardson, special commissioner for the exposition to Arkansas, said the Arkansas people had been invited to come to Omaha in order that they might gain a more intelligent idea of the exposition than could be acquired in any other way.  The speaker reviewed the pleasant experiences he had encountered when he went to Arkansas as the representative of the exposition.  He had found the people alive to the importance of the enterprise to them and ready and willing to take hold of the matter with energy.  Out of that feeling grew the visit of this delegation and he pleaded with the visitors to take advantage of the opportunity offered them to show the world the resources of their state, which have been almost unknown outside of the state.  He advised the people of the state to sever forever the cords which bind them to the dead past and rise triumphant to greet the dawn of a new present, bidding farewell to the venerable Arkansas traveler while inscribing upon his antiquated saddlebags the filling legend, "Requiescat in pace."</p>
                            <p>Rev. J. W. Lucey of Pine Bluff, a Catholic clergyman, made a witty reference to the fact that "talk" is a staple article in Arkansas, and then discussed eloquently the effects of exposition upon commercial matters, saying that they are a strong factor in binding together the different commercial sections.  He promised that his state would take part in the exposition and assist in making it a great success.</p>
                            <p>George Sengel of Fort Smith, president of the State Board of Trade, said the previous speakers had so thoroughly covered the ground that nothing remained to be said, but he proceeded to make an eloquent speech in which he sketched briefly the importance to the entire world of such a great exposition of the magnificent resources of the fertile west, demonstrating beyond all cavil that this great section produced within its borders everything needed for the comfort and luxury of man, and declaring that when this fact is proved to the commercial east the attitude of that section toward the west and south will be greatly changed.</p>

                            <p>This closed the post-prandial exercises and the entire party proceeded in a body to The Bee building, where they called on the editor and inspected the building, afterward visiting the office of the Department of Publicity and Promotion and securing a large amount of literature relating to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The visitors will remain in the city until this afternoon or this evening and will then start on their return trip.</p>
                            <p>About one-half of the visitors are members of the Arkansas Exposition commission, but all are equally enthusiastic regarding the absolute necessity of their state participating in the most extensive manner possible.</p>
                            <p>W. D. Matthews, secretary of the Arkansas commission, is an old resident of Nebraska.  He was the founder of the O'Neill Frontier, one of the leading newspapers in this state, and was later register of the land office at that point.  He is now the editor and proprietor of a newspaper at Stuttgart, and is a most enthusiastic exposition boomer.  Speaking of the outlook in his adopted state for participation in the exposition, Mr. Matthews said:  "We will be here with a good exhibit, but the exact extent of it depends somewhat upon the arrangements we will be able to make with the exposition management here.  We will put up a state building and will make a state exhibit ,regardless of what happens, and we are going to make some of the other states ashamed of themselves.  Our building will be a hummer and no mistake.  We will have all the material donated by the various industries in the state and will have a fine place.  It will be constructed of native woods, including some of our finest finishing woods, also several different kinds of building stone arranged in most effective and striking manner, and our native marbles.  We have some of the finest building stone and marble produced in this country and we propose to show to the people who visit this exposition that we have about all the fine building material that is required to erect the finest mansion that may be conceived.  We will get all this building material donated by the people who are in this business, as I have said, and all the cost incident to the erection of the building will be the labor of constructing it.</p>

                            <p>"We have no state appropriation," continued Mr. Matthews, "but we will raise the necessary money by private subscriptions.  We have estimated that we will require about $15,000 to erect our building and make a fine exhibit and we anticipate no especial difficulty in raising that amount."</p>

                            <head type="sub">MUSIC FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Director Kimball Secures Endorsement of His Detailed Plan.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The music of the exposition has at last taken definite form and the plan outlined by Musical Director Kimball some time ago has been approved by the executive committee and active operations under it will be commenced at once.  A the time of his appointment, the latter part of last month, Prof. Kimball outlined his idea of the general plan on which the music of the exposition should be conducted, which was set forth in The Bee at the time.  Since then Prof. Kimball has been endeavoring to make arrangements for the preliminary steps in carrying this plan to a successful issue, but the first step was only taken yesterday, when he first appeared before the executive committee and explained his plan at length and received the approval of the committee.  He then named Thomas J. Kelly of Omaha to take charge of the work of organizing the local chorus and drilling it in the music to be selected for the occasion.  This also met with the approval of the committee and Mr. Kelly was duly installed.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OUTLINES HIS PLANS.</head>
                            <p>After this was accomplished Prof. Kimball was seen at the Millard hotel and went more into detail in regard to his plan.  "I propose," said he, "to have a series of choral concerts during the entire exposition and to invite the famous choral societies of all our western cities to come here and give complete works with the assistance of the best obtainable artists.  As a nucleus for this work I wish to organize a local chorus composed of the singers of Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs, to the number of about 200.  There will also be engaged an orchestra which shall be thoroughly competent to do any work which it may be called upon to do and which shall be sufficient, in itself, to attract music-loving people by its concerts at stated intervals.  In each branch of this orchestra there will be soloists of high artistic merit.</p>
                            <p>"Mr. Kelly will commence organizing the local chorus at once.  The members of the chorus will be given instruction in the music they will sing and I shall come here occasionally, as my duties permit, and rehearse them, but the bulk of the work will fall upon Mr. Kelly up to the time the exposition opens.  The members of the chorus will be given free admission to the auditorium on the days when concerts are to be given, and this will give then the great educational advantage of hearing more concerts and more great soloists in a given length of time than would be possible in any other way.  For these advantages each member of the chorus will be charged a fee of $5 to defray some of the incidental expenses preliminary to the work.</p>
                            <p>"I wish to invite all the representative singers of this city to unite with this chorus.  I hope that there will be hearty and prompt co-operation on the part of our home singers and that we shall be able to show to visitors and music lovers that home talent can vie with that of other western cities and with that of the most effete regions of the east.</p>
                            <p>"An exposition chorus book will be compiled for the use of the chorus and this will serve as an interesting memento of the occasion which every member of the chorus will wish to preserve."</p>

                            <head type="sub">CHORAL MASTER WELL KNOWN.</head>
                            <p>As organist and choir master of the First Methodist church and director of the Mondamin Choral society of this city, Mr. Kelly has been identified with the musical progress of Omaha during the last few years in a way that gives him a wide and favorable reputation among the music loving public.  Mr. Kelly says he will commence at once with the organizing of the local chorus and a general meeting of singers will be held Monday evening of next week, at some place to be announced later, for the purpose of forming the organization.  In the meantime Mr. Kelly said he would be glad to see anyone wishing to become members of the chorus at his studio, or those desiring to make inquiries by mail could do so by addressing him at exposition headquarters in the Paxton block.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Kimball and Kelly will go to Chicago some time next week to conclude arrangements regarding the orchestra which is to be organized for the exposition.  Negotiations have been pending for some time with one of the most prominent orchestral organizations in the country and these may be concluded at any time.</p>

The telegram read as follows: "The American Maize propaganda organized; it will start with a special corn palace at the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha and will meet there in October of this year in the first annual convention to arrange for the expositions of 1889 and 1900."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Matter of Supply Put on a Business Basis with a Liberal Reduction from the Schedule Rates.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There was another turn in the controversy between the exposition management and the Omaha Water company yesterday when President Theodore C. Woodbury of the later company arrived here from Portland, Me.  Some days ago the exposition directory through a committee asked President Woodbury what terms the company would make in furnishing water to the exposition.  Soon after his arrival here yesterday President Woodbury sent an open letter to the exposition committee naming the terms of the company.  His letter is addressed to Gurdon W. Wattles, chairman of the committee, and others, and is as follows:</p>
                            <p>OMAHA, Feb. 17, 1898.&#8212;Gurdon W. Wattles, Chairman Committee, and Others: Gentlemen&#8212;As you know, a formal answer to your communication inquiring the terms under which the Omaha Water company would furnish water to the exposition has been delayed by the negotiations respecting the amount of water which would be required and the terms under which payment required and the terms under which payment would be made, in order to justify the expenditure which would be necessary to furnish it.</p>
                            <p>I now desire, having fully discussed with your committee those preliminary matters, to make you a formal reply.</p>
                            <p>In December last the water company made an offer to furnish the exposition company with free water and to take its plant at cost, provided the company was assured of possession of the property until 1908.  This hope of the water company and of the exposition company having been frustrated by injunction, to which we were not a party, and in which it is evident we cannot be justly treated, must be abandoned.</p>
                            <p>During the pendency of these negotiations the water company has supplied the exposition with free water, to the value of over $10,000, and is still continuing to supply it.</p>
                            <p>To meet your request we shall need to expend a large sum of money.  We are advised and believe correctly that we are under no legal obligations to furnish this water.  But should we stand upon our legal rights we should be forced into a position of antagonism toward the executive committee and others with whom our relations have been harmonious and satisfactory, and we would injure the exposition, in the success of which we are concerned.  Under these circumstances the water company will waive those questions and will connect its mains with those of the exposition company and furnish water to an amount not to exceed 2,000,000 gallons in any one day at 5 cents per 1,000 gallons, upon the following conditions:</p>
                            <p>The indebtedness due from the city to the company shall be first paid and all litigation in respect thereto dismissed and settled.</p>
                            <p>The bill of the Omaha Water company to the exposition company for water furnished shall be paid monthly.</p>
                            <p>If the city legally orders pipe and hydrants on streets where it is now laid on the exposition grounds the water company will take the same at its cost and cost of laying.</p>
                            <p>It is also understood as a part of this proposition that the exposition committee will see to it that the payments for water furnished will be duly made.</p>
                            <p>Meter to be furnished by the water company and one-half the cost paid by the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The lagoon to be filled first time by water company free of charge.</p>
                            <p>The charge for water at above rates to commence on May 1, 1898.  Water for construction purposes to be furnished free of charge.  Very respectfully,</p>
                            <signed>THEODORE C. WOODBURY, <lb/> President.</signed>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">ENDORSED BY CITY OFFICIALS.</head>
                            <p>The settlement of the exposition water controversy suggested by President Woodbury of the water company in his communication to the exposition officials is very favorably regarded by city officials.  At least Councilman Stuht says it is all right, and, as he has come to be regarded as expert authority on water works questions, no one is inclined to dispute his position.  Stuht says that as far as he has had an opportunity to consider the proposition it seems to be very reasonable.  He says that all that he sticks for is to prevent any action that involves waiving the right of the city to purchase the plant and that aside from that he is willing to compromise on a reasonable basis.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Burnester of the committee on fire, water and police said that he had not read the letter, but if its contents had been correctly stated to him he is inclined to think the water company has made a very fair proposition.</p>
                            <p>Councilman Bechel takes a similar view, but suggests that of course it will be impossible for the council to take any official notice of the matter until the injunction that is now in force is dissolved.  He thinks that the proposed arrangement is very equitable, as what the water company will receive from the exposition association will not aggregate enough to pay for the cost of the plant on the exposition grounds, to say nothing of the extra pumping facilities that will be required.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores did not express a decided opinion, as he had not had an opportunity to fully consider the proposition, but he said that at first glance it seemed to promise a very fair adjustment of the difficulty.</p>
                            <p>As far as the city is concerned the demand of the water company involves nothing beyond what has already been conceded.  The city now owes the water company $43,373.60 for hydrant rentals during the last six months of 1896, and $87,040 for the same service during 1897.  The 1896 bills have already been approved, the warrants drawn and the amount charged against the water rent fund.  Before the warrants were delivered to the water company an injunction was granted and the warrants still remain in the hands of the comptroller.  The 1897 bills have never been approved on account of the injunction, but there is no disposition to question them, and the prospective issue of refunding bonds is designed to cover this item.  As the only thing that prevents these bills from being paid anyway is the injunction, the members of the council take the position that the water company is only asking from the city what is conceded to belong to it.  There are a number of small bills pending for water furnished to the city hall and jail, which are not taken into consideration, and are the only bills on account of which there is now any controversy between the city and the water company.</p>

                            <p>Herman Kountze, one of the Board of Directors of the exposition, who has opposed all attempts to make the extension of the water company's franchise a part of the deal whereby the exposition was to secure water, had this to say regarding the proposition:  "I am inclined to favor the proposition substantially as Mr. Woodbury presents it.  I am opposed to legal proceedings whenever they can be avoided.  I also believe that all suits now pending to restrain the payment of indebtedness which the city owes the water company should be dismissed.  The rate which the water company proposes to charge the exposition I believe to be a reasonable one, being one-half the legal rate, and the rate which I believe is charged the large interests in South Omaha.  The question of extending the company's franchise does not enter into this matter and should have no bearing on it."</p>
                            <p>W. S. Poppleton, plaintiff in the suit against the city officials to restrain them from granting the water company any extension of its franchise, said:  "I am pleased to see that the question of extension is waived in this proposition.  I have been principally interested in that and it seems to me that the citizens have won a victory.  I am also pleased to see that the water company agrees to purchase the pipes now laid on the exposition grounds if the city orders such mains laid, and also that the company agrees to furnish water at 5 cents per thousand gallons, which is less than the legal rate, and also agrees to furnish water free until May 1.

                            <head type="sub">INTEREST OF THE LITIGANTS.</head>
                            <p>John L. Webster, an exposition director and the attorney for J. E. Baum, the surviving plaintiff in the suit brought by Dan Farrell and J. E. Baum against the city to restrain the payment of hydrant rental to the water company, replied as follows to a question regarding his views of the situation:  "I am disposed to favor the acceptance of the proposition of Mr. Woodbury as to the terms and conditions on which water shall be furnished to the exposition.  Mr. Baum must speak for himself as to the dismissal of the injunction suit, but I believe he feels as I do, that an immediate settlement of this water question is desirable, and that concessions on the part of the water company should meet with reciprocal treatment on our part."</p>
                            <p>J. E. Baum, the plaintiff in the suit against the city heretofore referred to, was inclined to be reticent about what he would do in the matter of dismissing the injunction suit, saying he first wanted to consult with the others interested in the suit in the interest of the Commercial club.  He also said that he believed the water company had used the exposition as a club to force concessions <unclear reason="covered"/> the city and had failed in its efforts <unclear reason="covered"/> declined to say whether he would or would not dismiss the suit.</p>

                            <p>Manager Bierbower of the water company said the proposition submitted by President Woodbury meant the expenditure of at least $250,000 by the company in enlarging its pipes.</p>
                            <p>the water company in increasing its capacity in order to supply the demands upon it.  "The details of the changes which will be necessary have not been fully decided on," said Mr. Bierbower, "but enough has been decided to settle the approximate amount which we will have to expend.  We will require an additional engine at the Florence pumping station, which will cost about $75,000, and additional mains will have to be laid and other changes made, which will bring the total cost up to about the figure I have named.  We will have to increase our capacity from Florence, but just how that shall be done has not been definitely settled.  We will not put in another 36-inch main, but some change will have to be made to enable us to supply the large amount of water the exposition will require."</p>

                            <p>President Wattles of the exposition expressed great satisfaction at the outcome of the efforts which have been made to secure a favorable proposition from the management of the water company.  He and Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds were in conference with President Woodbury all day yesterday and the entire executive committee of the exposition, President Wattles and President Woodbury were in session at exposition headquarters last night until a late hour, a conclusion being reached and the reply of President Woodburg being formulated at that meeting.  Mr. Wattles said he believed that the proposition submitted is a fair one, all things considered, and the rate offered the exposition for water is a very reasonable rate, being the same rate at which water is supplied to the South Omaha packing houses and other large consumers.</p>
                            <p>The members of the executive committee also expressed themselves as satisfied with the outcome of the efforts which have been made to secure water and fire protection for the exposition.</p>

                            <p>In this connection it is an interesting fact that all but one of Nebraska's governors are now living and are residents of the state over which they once ruled as chief executive.  Governor David W. Butler is the only one of the whole line who has been gathered to his fathers, the others being as follows:  Robert W. Furnas, Brownville; Silas Garber, Red Cloud; Albinus Nance, Lincoln; James W. Dawes, Crete; John M. Thayer, Lincoln; James E. Boyd, Omaha; Lorenzo Crounse, Calhoun.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ARRANGEMENTS FOR EXHIBIT CONCLUDED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Delegates Decline to Start Home Until All Details Are Decided&#8212;Happy Termination to a Very Pleasant Visit.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Arkansas delegation spent all of yesterday in fixing upon the arrangements for the exhibit to be made by their state and did not leave the city until 9:30 p. m., their car being attached to the regular Missouri Pacific train which leaves at that hour.  Before leaving they settled definitely that Arkansas will erect a building and install therein its exhibit, including all lines except horticulture, which will be shown in the Horticulture building.  A beautiful building of native wood, stone and marble will be erected and an exhibit will be made which will include the many products of the state.  It is estimated by members of the commission that about $15,000 will be required to carry out this plan but they express the greatest confidence that this will be raised without difficulty.</p>
                            <p>The party had fully intended to start for home at 3:05 p. m., and their car was attached to the regular Missouri Pacific train which leaves at that hour, but just as the conductor was about to give the signal to start the members of the party concluded that they had better stay until they had fully determined just what should be done.  Up to this time it had been generally agreed that an exhibit should be made, but it was not determined whether a building should be erected or not.  In this uncertainty space aggregating about 12,000 feet had been reserved in the Agriculture, Horticulture, Mines and Liberal Arts buildings, and no definite location for a building had been decided upon.  A number of the commissioners insisted that this was a very unsatisfactory outcome of their long trip and that more definite arrangements should be made.  It was at this point that their car was disconnected from the train which at once steamed out of the depot.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SELECTING A SITE.</head>
                            <p>The exposition officials who were present announced that General Agent Phillippi of the Missouri Pacific would send for a yard engine and haul the special car of the party direct to the exposition grounds, where the visitors might select a location for their building.  This was a delightful issue out of their difficulty and the delegation warmly thanked Colonel Phillippi.  It was no sooner said than done, and the party alighted from their car on the bluff tract and proceeded to make a careful examination of the few desirable locations remaining unassigned.</p>
                            <p>A selection was soon made in the minds of the visitors and then the party returned down town and went direct to the exposition offices.  Architect Kimball was summoned and an agreement was quickly reached, the visitors being given the site they most desired.  They then released the space in the main buildings which had been reserved, with the exception of the Horticulture building, and all the preliminary arrangements were complete.</p>
                            <p>The site decided upon for the Arkansas building is about 200 feet north of the west end of the Horticulture building, one of the most desirable sites in the entire tract assigned to the state buildings.  It will face one of the broad main avenues leading to the Horticulture building and will be between that building and the grand plaza, where people will enter the bluff tract from the main court.  The site selected for the Missouri building is in a corresponding location near the east end of the Horticulture building.</p>
                            <p>The intervening time until the departure of their train was spent by the visitors in visiting the various exposition departments and acquiring all kinds of information.  They were plentifully supplied with exposition literature by the Department of Publicity and Promotion and when they started for home they were profuse in their pledges of a fine exhibit from the "home of the razorback."</p>

                            <head type="sub">SENTIMENT OF THE VISITORS.</head>
                            <p>After all arrangements for the Arkansas exhibit had been completed Judge Jones of Pine Bluff, a member of the Arkansas Exposition commission, voiced what seemed to be the unanimous sentiment of all the party regarding the making of a fine exhibit.  "We will have an exhibit, beyond all question," said the judge.  "The extent of it will depend entirely upon the manner in which our people support our commission.  I do not anticipate any difficulty in raising the amount we believe is necessary, about $15,000, for putting up a building, installing a fine exhibit and maintaining it during the exposition.  We have very little time in which to make our preparations, but I believe we can do it.  It is most unfortunate that our legislature made no appropriation for this purpose, but we can only make the best of it now.  We have abundant resources from which to raise this money and we will be here this summer with an exhibit that will make people open their eyes."</p>
                            <p>The party was increased yesterday morning by the arrival of James T. Pomeroy of Eureka Springs, who stopped in Kansas City to attend the meeting of the Missouri Exposition commission and learn something of what Missouri intends to do.  Mr. Pomeroy asserted most positively that the northwestern part of the state where he lives will be represented by an exhibit regardless of what the rest of the state may do.</p>
                            <p>"Our section is thoroughly aroused," said Mr. Pomeroy, "and we are going to have an exhibit.  I accompanied the Missouri commission on its visit to Omaha and when I returned home and told our people of what the exposition was going to be they all agreed with me that we must make an exhibit and show the world what we have down there in the Ozark mountain country.  We have made arrangements to reproduce one of our famous mineral springs and keep it supplied with the natural spring water during the entire exposition and we are also going to have an exhibit of the fruits and other products which are grown in our section.  If the state makes a general exhibit we will join with it and do all we can in the interest of a fine exhibit."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Prof. Kimball Eager to Begin on the Exposition Organization.</head>
                            <p>A meeting to organize the Exposition chorus will be held Monday evening of next week.  The first meeting will be held in Hayden's music hall, at Sixteenth and Dodge streets, but permanent quarters will be secured in time for the next meeting.  This first meeting will be in the nature of a rally and all who desire to join the chorus or assist in making the music of the exposition a success are invited by Musical Director Kimball to be present at that time and make their desires known.  Prof. Kimball will be present at the meeting and will explain the details of the plan on which musical work of the exposition will be based.  He wishes it understood that singers in Omaha and Council Bluffs, South Omaha or in the <choice><sic>surorunding</sic><corr>surrounding</corr></choice> towns who will agree to attend the rehearsals and comply with the requirements of the rules will be admitted to membership in the chorus and made welcome.</p>
                            <p>"The executive committee of the exposition has just consented to a little detail I have been urging for some time," said Prof. Kimball, "and that is to agree that arrangements shall be made whereby people may gain admission to the Auditorium building to hear the concert without first paying a fee to get into the exposition grounds.  I believe this is a strong point in one respect.  At the World's fair this little detail raised a great storm of protest, and I believe it injured the attendance at the concerts.  I think we can secure more of an audience at the concerts by this means than would otherwise attend, as they will not be compelled to pay double fee when they wish to only hear the concert and go away again.</p>
                            <p>"The people should not lose sight of the fact that the Auditorium is to be supplied with the finest organ in this part of the country.  The exposition authorities made arrangements some time ago with an eastern company to construct one of its finest organs and place it in the Auditorium building.  This instrument will have 2,700 pipes, three manuals, fifty stops, and will be used in connection with the orchestra.  It will also be used for organ concerts and arrangements will be made with some of the most eminent organists in the country to come here and give recitals on it.</p>
                            <p>"I am now carrying on negotiations with the well known Theodore Thomas orchestra and expected to close an engagement for that organization to come to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>"The time is short in which to accomplish the great amount of work which must be done in order to make the music of the exposition a credit to the great enterprise, but with the hearty co-operation of the musicians of Omaha, South Omaha, Council Bluffs and the surrounding territory we will have a Musical department that will be a credit to any musical center.  The time has come when no mere personal impulse should be allowed to interfere with the carrying on of a project which is bound to reflect credit on the entire community if properly supported.  The result accomplished by these cities will be taken as a criterion by which the musical culture of Nebraska and Iowa will be judged and personal pride should impel every singer in this entire section to put his shoulder to the wheel and give all the assistance in his power."</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Exposition association held its regular meeting last evening.  The reports from the committees on soliciting funds showed that the business portion of the city had been quite well canvassed, with the exception of South Main street, and it was <choice><sic>suggeste dthat</sic><corr>suggested that</corr></choice> the work be extended to other parts of the city beside the business portion, as considerable funds could probably be secured in this way.  None of the committees had entirely finished their work and from the interest manifested and the amounts already subscribed the prospect looks bright for the carrying on of the work as previously laid out.</p>
                            <p>The Council Bluffs buttons have not met with as ready sale as was at first hoped for, but quite a number are being sold.  It was decided to ask the women of the city, who are at work in the interest of the children's building and the wigwam, to assist in selling the buttons, as a portion of the money raised by them goes to the children's building fund and a part to the fund for the wigwam.  The committee on grounds reported that the grounds could be had free of charge, provided that no competitive exhibit be made, in which case the site would cost $1,000.</p>
                            <p>A report was circulated yesterday that the proceeds of the Dickens party given last evening by the art department of the Women's club was to benefit the Council Bluffs Exposition association, but such is not the fact.  Secretary Judson stated that he was daily receiving quite a number of names and addresses of persons wishing to entertain guests during the exposition.  Prof. Hisey stated that in the homes of the children that attend the Bloomer school about 2,000 guests would be entertained, all being friends or relatives in the homes.  The children of this school represent about one-tenth of the school enrollment of the city, and a conclusion can easily be drawn as to the number of families in the city that will entertain company outside of the strangers that will seek lodging here.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AIDS IN SETTLING WATER CONTROVERSY</head>
                            <head type="sub">Injunction that Restrains City from Paying Its Bills to Be Withdrawn and the Warrants Issued to <choice><sic>Compnay</sic><corr>Company</corr></choice>.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There is every indication that the long-pending controversy in which the water works company, the city, the exposition association and several individuals have been more or less involved will be settled at once.  J. E. Baum will withdraw the injunction proceedings against the city, the city will pay the back bills of the water company, and the latter will reciprocate by preparing at once to furnish the exposition with water.</p>
                            <p>The first positive statement with regard to the withdrawal of the injunction proceedings was authorized by Mr. Baum this morning.  He said that the stipulations had already been prepared and the suit would in all probability be dismissed some time today.  In speaking of his action, Mr. Baum said that as far as his individual interests were concerned he would prefer to stand pat and fight it out with the water company.  He contended that the city had not received the service that it was entitled to and that the business men had been compelled to pay exorbitant insurance rates and support a more expensive fire department on that account.  Moreover, as he looked at it the concession of the water company was no concession at all, as it simply proposed to furnish water for the exposition.  But as the contention for an extension of the right of purchase had been waived and the exposition could not wait for the end of a continued litigation, he had decided that it would be the better policy to drop the suit and allow the controversy to be settled.  While the rate at which the company proposes to furnish water for the exposition was no better than was given to other equally heavy consumers, it was probably the best that could be obtained, and since the proposition had been endorsed by the exposition directory he was not inclined to stand in the way of a settlement.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">READY TO MAKE CONNECTIONS.</head>
                            <p>Manager Bierbower stated in reply to an inquiry that connections between the mains of the company and the water system of the exposition grounds would be made just as soon as the conditions of President Woodbury's proposition are complied with.  "We are ready to make the connection at once," said he, "and it remains for the exposition management and others interested to carry out the conditions named.  As soon as connections are made the exposition grounds will have fire protection and our company will proceed to make the alterations necessary to carry out our part of the agreement and furnish the water required for the exposition.  The connections already made with the grounds supplies all the water required to keep the lagoon at its present level and supply water for construction purposes.  This water has been supplied by us free of charge since the commencement of work on the grounds."</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has been authorized by the executive committee of the exposition to enter into a contract with the Omaha Water company for supplying water under the conditions imposed in President Woodbury's letter, and a contract carrying out this agreement has been drawn up and is awaiting his signature.  He said he would sign the document as soon as it had been examined and found in proper form and this would close the matter as far as the exposition is concerned.</p>

                                <l>Of the final day when all the dead shall rise;</l>

                                <l>And their occupants shall hasten to the skies&#8212;</l>
                                <l>Grim St. Peter then will set the gates to swinging</l>
                                <l>Wide for those who hold their passports in their hands,</l>
                                <l>And the golden harps of heaven will be ringing</l>
                                <l>Out a welcome to the pilgrims from all lands.</l>

                                <l>For St. Peter's seen enough of common mortals</l>
                                <l>As through the pearly gates they've marched along.</l>
                                <l>He will watching be for one real modest captain,</l>
                                <l>The modestest since nature first began,</l>
                                <l>And spying him, St. Peter'll have him wrapped in</l>

                                <l>For St. Peter is familiar with the story</l>
                                <l>And has written Rosey's name among the stars.</l>
                                <l>Well St. Peter knows that through all times and ages,</l>
                                <l>By the aid of reincarnation's plan,</l>

                                <l>Was not won by Josh that long extended day.</l>

                                <l>Music, war and art, philosophy and science,</l>
                                <l>In fact, the whole thing since the dawn of time began,</l>
                                <l>In Rosewater put their utmost reliance,</l>
                                <l>For he stands today Nebraska's Greatest Man.</l>

                                <l>The latter will hand over all his keys;</l>
                                <l>And Rosewater, acting then with quick decision,</l>
                                <l>Will proceed to run the place just as he please.</l>
                                <l>For himself he'll order wings a whole lot brighter,</l>
                                <l>And flying all through heaven he will scan</l>

                                <l>And consider well, for on it rests your fate;</l>
                                <l>What shall we do without Rosey, let me ask you,</l>
                                <l>When he takes command inside of heaven's gate?</l>
                                <l>Who will manager all our politics and trading?</l>
                                <l>Who will carry out the exposition plan?</l>
                                <l>Woe betide us when from out our sight is fading</l>
                                <l>E. Rosewater, who's Nebraska's Greatest Man!</l>

                                <l>But when Rosey goes to run the courts of heaven,</l>
                                <l>Leaving us behind to grope in darkest gloom,</l>
                                <l>One bright thought our lump of sorrow will then leaven</l>
                                <l>As we gather to strew flowers on his tomb&#8212;</l>
                                <l>We will know that Rosey, through the heavens flying,</l>
                                <l>All our struggles on and up will closely scan.</l>
                                <l>So upon the stone 'neath which his bones are lying</l>

                            <p>Now the exposition has a general superintendent who has executive authority over the affairs of the gigantic enterprise and will carry out the policy outlined by the executive committee.  A. C. Foster, a well known citizen of Omaha, is the man and he was appointed by the executive committee at its meeting yesterday afternoon.  He is to take possession of the new office at once.</p>
                            <p>The Board of Directors of the exposition at its meeting on November 15 adopted the report of a special committee to which had been referred a resolution providing for the appointment of a director general.  This committee reported that it found the situation did not warrant the appointment of director general at that time, but it recommended the appointment of a general superintendent in these words:  "The work of all departments might be energetically pushed, perhaps more satisfactorily than by any other arrangement, by the <choice><sic>apointment</sic><corr>appointment</corr></choice> of a general superintendent, a practical builder, at a maximum salary of $200 per month, whose office and headquarters shall be upon the exposition grounds."</p>
                            <p>In order to meet the emergency which then existed the special committee defined specifically a part of the duties which should devolve upon this officer by providing that he "should be placed in charge of all work in the line of construction of any or all of the departments, with the express duty of overseeing and pushing all such work to energetic completion."</p>

                            <p>Since this section on the part of the Board of Directors there has been considerable discussion of this matter and a growing demand for the appointment of some well known and capable man to fill the position.  This strong sentiment on the part of the general public and many members of the Board of Directors has been referred to in the columns of The Bee a number of times.  The appointment of Mr. Foster meets with the general approval of people of this city.  Although the appointment was not made until late yesterday afternoon, it was soon known on the streets and public opinion was freely expressed.  Mr. Foster is well known in this section, having been connected with the Swift Packing company for a number of years as general manager.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee also made another appointment at the meeting yesterday, Major T. S. Clarkson drawing a prize in the shape of an appointment to assist the president in entertaining distinguished visitors and officiating on ceremonial occasions.  The appointment was made at the request of President Wattles and the salary was fixed at $100 per month till June 1 and $200 per month after that date.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed turned over to the executive committee a job lot of trouble in the shape of fifteen propositions for the concession to sell roast beef sandwiches on the grounds.  This concession is in great demand and the fifteen applicants have been making life a burden to Manager Reed for several months.  He asked the executive committee to relieve him of the responsibility of <choice><sic>dciding</sic><corr>deciding</corr></choice> between the numerous applicants and the matter was made a special order for the meeting of <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The pleasant weather which has prevailed in this section for some time has been taken advantage of to the fullest extent by the contractors and all others having to do with the work of preparing for the great exposition which is to be opened to the public June 1 of this year, and the result is that the building on the grounds are in an advanced state, which removes any doubt as to the exposition being opened on time.</p>
                            <p>The Mines building is ready for the reception of exhibits.  This building has been finished for some time, all that remains to be done being a small amount of staff work around the exterior near the ground, which cannot be completed until all the frozen debris lying about is removed.</p>
                            <p>The Machinery and Electricity building will be in the same condition as the Mines building within a very few days.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures and Agriculture buildings are in an advanced stage of completion.  The staff work is almost completed and rapid progress has been made during the favorable weather.</p>
                            <p>The outside of the Auditorium building is nearly covered with staff and plaster and will be finished within a few days.  The interior is lathed and plastering will be begun <choice><sic>nside</sic><corr>inside</corr></choice> very soon.</p>
                            <p>The Liberal Arts building is making rapid progress.  The staff on the outside is nearly all in place and plastering is proceeding rapidly on the inside.</p>
                            <p>The Art <choice><sic>buildng</sic><corr>building</corr></choice> is ready for the staff workers.  The woodwork of the east section will not be finished until after the plasterers shall have completed their work on the inside, and the west section is in almost the same condition.  The roof is finished on both sections and the skylight covering has been put in place.</p>
                            <p>The Government building is making more rapid progress than any of the other buildings and is completely under cover, except in the center, where the dome will appear.  Engineer Farnan is in charge of the work and is pushing it with all possible speed.  "You may say that this building will be ready on time," said Mr. Farnam most emphatically yesterday to a Bee representative.</p>

                            <div3>
                                <p>There is every indication that the long-pending controversy in which the water works company, the city, the exposition association and several individuals have been more or less involved will be settled at once.  J. E. Baum will withdraw the injunction proceedings against the city, the city will pay the back bills of the water company, and the latter will reciprocate by preparing at once to furnish the exposition with water.</p>
                                <p>The first positive statement with regard to the withdrawal of the injunction proceedings was authorized by Mr. Baum yesterday morning.  He said that the stipulations had already been prepared and the suit would in all probability be dismissed some time today.  In speaking of his action, Mr. Baum said that as far as his individual interests were concerned he would prefer to stand pat and fight it out with the water company.  He contended that the city had not received the service that it was entitled to and that the business men had been compelled to pay exorbitant insurance rates and support a more expensive fire department on that account.  Moreover, as he looked at it the concession of the water company was no concession at all, as it simply proposed to furnish water for the exposition.  But as the contention for an extension of the right of purchase had been waived and the exposition could not wait for the end of a continued litigation, he had decided that it would be the better policy to drop the suit and allow the controversy to be settled.  While the rate at which the company proposes to furnish water for the exposition was no better than was given to other equally heavy consumers, it was probably the best that could be obtained, and since the proposition had been endorsed by the exposition directory he was not inclined to stand in the way of a settlement.</p>

                                <p>Manager Bierbower stated in reply to an inquiry that connections between the mains of the company and the water system of the exposition grounds would be made just as soon as the conditions of President Woodbury's proposition are complied with.  "We are ready to make the connection at once," said he, "and it remains for the exposition management and others interested to carry out the conditions named.  As soon as connections are made the exposition grounds will have fire protection and our company will proceed to make the alterations necessary to carry out our part of the agreement and furnish the water required for the exposition.  The connections already made with the grounds supplies all the water required to keep the lagoon at its present level and supply water for construction purposes.  This water has been supplied by us free of charge since the commencement of work on the grounds."</p>
                                <p>President Wattles has been authorized by the executive committee of the exposition to enter into a contract with the Omaha Water company for supplying water under the conditions imposed in President Woodbury's letter, and a contract carrying out this agreement has been drawn up and is awaiting his signature.  He said he would sign the document as soon as it had been examined and found in proper form and this would close the matter as far as the exposition is concerned.</p>

                            <p>Owing to the failure of numerous Omaha babies to "look pleasant" the Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition has concluded to postpone their celebration of Washington's birthday for a few days.  It was decided some time ago to have the front cover page of The Hatchet embellished with the counterfeit presentments of twenty Omaha youngsters and to have the text of the sheet likewise ornamented at frequent intervals.  There was a flood of applicants for these positions, but it developed that every loving mother decided that "her darling" must have a new picture "expressly for the Hatchet," regardless of whether the birth anniversary of the nation's paternal ancestor would have to be postponed to await the pleasure of mamma, the youngster and the photographer.  Of course this argument was unanswerable in the minds of the managers of the paper, and the father of his country will have to wait until the fates decide that the proper time has come.  It is announced at the headquarters of the Hatchet that the delay will be for a very few days only and that the paper will be issued shortly after the time first fixed.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Exhibits is receiving most encouraging reports from France of the preparations which are being made there by manufacturers and others who will make exhibits at the exposition, and there is every indication that the French section of the great enterprise will be one of the most extensive and attractive portions in the entire grounds.  Frederick Mayer, the special commissioner of the department at Paris, writes to the department that great interest is being taken in the matter by the people in France and a commission has been formed, comprising fifty of the most prominent manufacturers in the vicinity of Paris.  This commission, he says, meets at the rooms of the Chamber of Commerce and has received official recognition from that body.  The most energetic preparations are being made for exhibiting their wares and Mr. Mayer predicts that the exhibit will be an unusually fine one.  He says the prospective exhibitors are making elaborate preparations, preparing booths, cases and other attractive means of making the exhibit a memorable one.</p>
                            <p>The Commercial club of West Superior, Wis., has appointed a committee to arrange for an exhibit at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Vice President W. H. Sutherlin of Montana has notified the Department of Exhibits that he will be in Omaha in about ten days to make further arrangements regarding Montana's exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The drawings and specifications for the Transportation and Agricultural Implement building have been completed by the architects and turned over to the Department of Buildings and Grounds to advertise for bids for its construction.</p>
                            <p>The Utah Exposition commission is completing its arrangements for extensive exhibits of the diversified resources of that state and is collecting the materials at Ogden, preparatory to shipping them to Omaha.  The secretary of the commission reports that the exhibit will be a very representative one.</p>
                            <p>The millers of Minneapolis are agitating the plan of making an extensive exhibit of flour at the exposition in an attempt to offset the large exhibit of Nebraska made flour which is to be made by all of the millers of Nebraska, in connection with which will be a cooking school where the excellent quality of Nebraska flour will be demonstrated.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Ceramic club has been assigned space in one of the most desirable locations in the Liberal Arts building gallery and the application of the club for 320 square feet of space, signed by Mrs. S. G. Lund, president, and Mrs. M. F. Morrill, secretary, has been accepted.  A committee of the club members spent several hours at the office of the Exhibit department making the selection of a desirable space and finally settled upon the location referred to.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Emma Homan Thayer, a member of the Colorado exposition commission, and the commissioner in charge of the fine art exhibit to be made by the artists of the Centennial state, was present when the Nebraska women selected their space and she at once applied for and was granted the 640 square feet of space adjoining that selected by the Ceramic club.  Mrs. Thayer says the artists of Colorado will make a fine exhibit of ceramics, paintings in oil and water colors and many other articles of exceptional excellence.</p>
                            <p>F. R. Anson, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of Salem, Ore., has notified the Department of Publicity and Promotion that a movement is on foot in that state to make an exhibit at the exposition and offers his assistance in helping it along.  Special Agent C. E. Llewellyn of the Department of Publicity and Promotion is in that state endeavoring to awaken enough interest among the business interests to insure an exhibit.  Oregon and Washington are the only two states in the entire transmississippi region which are not making active preparations to be well represented at the exposition.  Surface indications appearing within the last week or so point to an effort of some kind to make a showing.</p>

                            <p>The Musical department of the exposition has gotten down to work and reports matters as coming along finely.  A large attendance on Monday night, at the annex of Hayden Brothers' music room, Sixteenth and Dodge streets, is confidently looked for.  President Wattles is expected to address the meeting, and Mr. Kimball, director of the Music department, will speak on the general plan and scope of the music of the exposition, followed by Thomas J. Kelly on the immediate object in view, and the future of Omaha in choral work.  All interested in music are invited to attend this meeting.</p>
                            <p>Director Kimball, accompanied by Choral Conductor Kelly, will go to Chicago on Tuesday evening and while there will arrange the detail plans of the exposition music as to programs, orchestra and soloists as far as possible.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kelly has been asked about the expense to the chorus members in addition to the $5.  There is none, he says.  The gowns of the young women will not have to be concert gowns, but simple white or light colored summer dresses, such as they would wear on the porch at home.  The men will be asked to wear blue serge coats, and white duck trousers, a suit which has been the popular thing for the last few summers.  The fee of $5 can be paid by installments, if necessary, although the committee prefers to have it paid in advance.  However, no barrier will be placed in any one's way, in this regard.  The sum of 35 cents per week paid or saved from now on to the exposition opening, and 50 cents on exposition day will admit members free of charge to all musical entertainments in the Auditorium for five months.  No fee will be necessary to get into the Auditorium, as a separate entrance has been provided adjacent to the street car line.  The local chorus will be heard evenings.</p>
                            <p>Director Kimball is enthusiastic over the action of the executive committee, and he expects to have a department that will reflect credit on the western country.  Mr. Kelly expects to come back from Chicago with a stock of fresh choruses for immediate use.  Rehearsals will be pushed vigorously when once begun.</p>
                            <p>If enough people come over from Council Bluffs for the organization meeting, the choral conductor will arrange to have special rehearsals at Council Bluffs in order to save the additional journey to the members.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Surprised at the Magnitude of the Enterprise.</head>
                            <p>The Minnesota Exposition commission has made a report to Governor Clough on its recent visit to Omaha to look over the exposition grounds and learn the status of the whole matter.  Regarding the impressions received during the visit the commission has the following to say:</p>
                            <p>The exposition association has well advanced toward completion a group of buildings beautiful in architecture and magnificent in their proportions, which promise to exceed in capacity, as well as in the architectural effect, anything offered to the public in the United States, with the single exception, perhaps, of the White City, which dazzled millions during the year 1893 in Chicago.  These buildings are but a part of the preparation now being made for an exposition which there is abundant evidence will be second only to the Columbian exposition of 1893.  The plans of the management are upon so comprehensive a scale, the responses from the various states in the transmississippi district have been so cordial and the co-operation of the United States government, as well as many foreign nations, has been so prompt and liberal that it is certain that the exposition will be greater than any that has preceded it in this country with the possible exception of the Centennial exposition and the World's Columbian exposition, to which reference  has already been made.  Any idea which any one of our people may have entertained <unclear reason="torn"/> in character or even confined to a few of the western or northwestern states was quickly disabused by the evidence which was produced and what we found had already been accomplished.  We desire to impress upon you that the work of the management has been so well done as to leave no shadow of doubt that the exposition will be all that is claimed for it.</p>
                            <p>We found that, with the exception of our own state, and possibly a few of the other remote western states and territories, provision had been made for state representation, either in the buildings or by buildings to be erected by private subscription, or by funds provided by legislative appropriation in some of the states where legislation has been possible.  We believe that Minnesota with her varied products, her almost limitless wealth of resources, should not fail to be represented in some way at this exposition.</p>
                            <p>After setting forth some of the reasons why Minnesota should be represented in a proper manner the report continues:</p>
                            <p>We believe, therefore, it is of the utmost importance that some steps be taken to adequately represent Minnesota as this exposition, and, therefore, appeal to individuals, communities and organized bodies throughout the state to give support to such effort as may be made by the commission already appointed by his excellency the governor to take this matter in charge.</p>

                            <p>Paul Charlton, chairman of the committee of the Western Art association, which has in charge the Art building and exhibit at the exposition, announces that matters in that department have reached a stage where he is able to say with authority that the art exhibit of the exposition will be on a very high plane of excellence and that the paintings which will be exhibited will be of such a class as to place the art exhibit of the Transmississippi Exposition among the most renowned exhibitions of this country.  He says he is not yet ready to make an announcement of the pictures which will be on exhibition, but gives the assurance that when this announcement is made the most critical will have no reason to complain.  There will be only about 600 or 800 pictures in the entire collection and the number of desirable works available will be sufficient to allow of the most careful discrimination in choosing pictures for the exhibition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Charlton also says that the sculpture which will embellish the Art building will be of a high order.  The designs for this were prepared by Eames &amp; Young of St. Louis, the architects of this building, and the figures are being modeled by Sculptor Bringhurst of St. Louis under the immediate supervision of the architects named.  Each of the eight pediments of this building will be surmounted by a draped female figure eight feet in height, and each pediment will enclose a group of figures of artistic and appropriate design.  At the base of each flag staff will be figures of cupids and the wide frieze which will appear in the panels will bear colored figures in high relief.</p>

He suggests that an advertising car be sent toward the south, plentifully supplied with advertising matter to be thoroughly distributed all through that section on the outward trip, and that the objective point of the trip be Mexico, where the car, which should then be empty, should be filled with some of the many fine specimens of cacti, century plants and other tropical plants which grow in profusion in that region and can be had in any quantity for nothing.  For the purpose of ensuring beneficial results, he advises sending two or three florists with the car to assist in distributing the advertising matter and to attend to the securing of plants.  He says any number of most attractive and desirable plants might be secured in this manner at little cost and transplanted in the exposition grounds for embellishment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">General Superintendent Assumes Control at the Grounds and Will Devote His Time to Work Out There.</head>
                            <p>General Superintendent A. C. Foster, the new executive officer of the exposition, has assumed the duties of his position and spent the day in familiarizing himself with the many complicated details of the work of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  Manager Kirkendall turned over to Mr. Foster the huge pile of correspondence relating to various matters connected with the department and accompanied him to the office of the department on the exposition grounds.  For the present Mr. Foster will devote himself to pushing the work of construction and preparation at the grounds and will spend almost his entire time there.</p>
                            <p>Major Thaddeus S. Clarkson, the newly appointed chief of the entertainment bureau of the exposition, has assumed the duties of his position in looking after the entertainment of visitors and distinguished guests, including the making arrangements for the celebrations which will form an important part of the exercises connected with the exposition.  The appointment of Major Clarkson to this important position has been the subject of extended comment since the action of the exposition management became known, and the <choice><sic>concensus</sic><corr>consensus</corr></choice> of opinion has been that no better selection could have been made.  The major's extended acquaintance, together with his experience in military matters, are regarded as giving him especial qualifications for filling this position with credit to himself and to the exposition.  As soon as the necessary arrangements can be made, Major Clarkson will be assigned an office on the sixth floor of the Paxton block, where he will make his headquarters.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Western Delegates Want to Spend a Sunday in Omaha.</head>
                            <p>C. E. Brainard of Ogden, Utah, transportation manager for the national organization of the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, proposes a plan to President Wattles which indicates that that organization has no particular sympathy with the movement in certain quarters which has for its object the closing of the gates of the exposition on Sundays.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Brainard urges that arrangements be made with railroads whereby the western roads passing through Omaha will give stopovers to all delegates en route from the west to the meeting of the national society of the Christian Endeavorers which meet in Nashville, Tenn, July 6 to 11.  He suggests that the time when these western delegates leave their homes should be so arranged that they would be able to spend Sunday, July 3, on the exposition grounds, that a meeting night be held there and the delegates given an opportunity of seeing the exposition, and that the delegates might remain in Omaha until the evening of July 4, thus arriving in Nashville in ample time for the opening session of the convention.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Brainard says the Omaha branches of the societies have signified their approval of the plan he suggests and he says he has also received letters of approval from other societies in the west.  He also states that John Willis Baer, the general secretary of the society, living at Boston, has favored the plan.</p>
                            <p>A plan similar to this was followed last year when the convention of the organization was held at San Francisco.  The railroads granted stopover privileges at Salt Lake and Ogden, and the delegates gladly took advantage of the opportunity of varying the monotony of a long trip.  Mr. Brainard urges President Wattles to confer with the railroad authorities regarding the granting of the stopover privilege and predicts that a very large number of the delegates will take advantage of it.  The president will give the matter his immediate attention and endeavor to have the necessary arrangements made in order that the program suggested may be carried out.</p>

                            <p>Colorado will visit the exposition tomorrow in force, a delegation of about thirty representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, Mining Exchange, Real Estate exchange and other commercial bodies of Denver, as well as prominent and influential residents of other portions of the state, being due to arrive in the city on the Union Pacific train which reaches Omaha at 7:30 a. m.  This party will be led by Lieutenant Governor Jed Bush and Mayor T. S. McMurray of Denver.  About one-half of the party will return to Denver on the Burlington train tomorrow evening and the others will remain until the following day, returning on the Rock Island.</p>

                            <p>Preparations for the entertainment of these visitors are in the hands of Major T. S. Clarkson, chief of the Entertainment bureau of the exposition, who has appointed the following committee to assist in looking after the visitors and escorting them about the city:  Governor S. A.

                            <p>The Department of Concession has just concluded the execution of a contract with Gaston Akoun for a concession which is designated at Cosmopolis, but it is thought this name will be changed.  This concession will occupy a space of 100 feet in width on the Midway and 400 feet in depth.  In the cen- will be a reproduction of the Parthenon, in front of which will be given celebrations of Olympian sports and games and from this will radiate streets representing sections of various prominent cities of the old world, including a street in Paris, a street in Seville and a section from the Island of Malta.  These streets will be constructed to represent in a graphic manner the original streets in the cities named and the inhabitants will depict the daily life, manners and customs of the people.  Each street will be supplied with shops and stores, in which the wares peculiar to the countries represented will be manufactured and sold and there will be a typical French restaurant, photograph gallery, where tintypes of visitors will be made, fortune telling booths, barber shop and many other places.  A vaudeville show where all the nationalities will perform their specialities will form one of the attractions and a carnival of Grecian games will form a drawing card.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Hardt of the Exhibits department says it will be necessary to extend the annex of the Manufactures building to the full limit allowable in the space chosen for the location of this building.  The annex will be built as a wing to the Manufactures building, extending north from the west end of the building, and space is available for a building nearly 700 feet in length.  Mr. Hardt says the rate at which applications are coming in for space for foreign exhibits, together with the number now on hand, make it imperative that immediate provision be made for making as much room as possible.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ONLY THE BEST ATTRACTIONS BOOKED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Propositions Are All Carefully Considered Before the Concessions Are Granted&#8212;Some of the Promised Shows.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There is one department of the exposition which has been working to add to the attractiveness of the great fair, but which has made very little noise up to this time, presumably on the theory that when the results of its labors are realized they will constitute the noisiest section of the entire entertainment.  The department referred to is that which has to do with concessions, which in these latter century days has come to mean, when applied to an exposition, a part of the "Midway."  It may be remarked that the name "Midway" seems to be accepted as the proper designation of that particular section of the exposition which is devoted to amusements which are out of the ordinary.  Several attempts have been made by the management of the Transmississippi Exposition to change this name, but no other has been found which seems quite so apt, and it will probably be called by that name to the end.</p>
                            <p>It is not customary to close contracts with features for the Midway far in advance of the opening of the exposition, as few of them are of such a character that they require a great deal of time for the erection of their building and installation.  For that reason it is only recently that the closing of contracts has commenced in earnest, and but a short time will elapse until the entire composition of the Midway will be definitely known.  Up to this time the main object of the department has been to secure proposals from desirable parties who desire to install attractions.</p>
                            <p>As propositions have been received which seemed especially desirable contracts have been entered into with the projectors and in this way a number of concessions have been let which form an index of the probably nature of the attractions which will make the Midway one of the most popular spots on the exposition grounds.  It may be stated with authority that the Midway of the Transmississippi Exposition will be one of the most complete and attractive resorts of the kind which has ever formed a part of the <unclear reason="torn"/> be lacking which the pampered taste of connoisseurs decrees is necessary in this modern addition to great national fairs and some of the finest and most artistic effects will be seen that were ever installed at any exposition.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">BEST OF ATTRACTIONS.</head>
                            <p>Owing to the policy heretofore referred to, there are not a great many contracts which have been closed, but the character of these, together with the character of those which are being considered, indicates that the Midway will be occupied by the high class attractions which the experience of other expositions has demonstrated to be the best.</p>
                            <p>There will be several villages, but only those which have proved to be desirable.  Previous Midways have been encumbered with alleged villages which proved unremunerative and a nuisance, but the villages on the Transmississippi Midway will be of a high class.  Contracts have been closed for the Moorish village, Streets of Cairo, African village and Chinese village.  The architecture of each of these will be of the class peculiar to the nationality depicted and this, of itself, will be a most instructive feature.</p>
                            <p>The Moorish village will be one of the most extensive concessions on the grounds.  It will show a group of Moorish houses with native inhabitants and illustrating the modes of living peculiar to the people of that land.  The paraphernalia will be gorgeous and correct, depicting the Oriental richness peculiar to its people.  In addition to this feature of the village there will be several adjuncts, including a "mirror maze," a palace of illusions and a wax gallery of wax figures in which will be represented historical and allegorical scenes.  Several other features are also under consideration in connection with this concession, which will add to its attractiveness and popularity.</p>
                            <p>The Streets of Cairo will be another spot on the Midway which will doubtless attract the attention of visitors.  This village will be distinctly oriental in its character and will be populated by the people from the sunny clime of Egypt.  The daily life of these people will be constantly in evidence and many of their picturesque ceremonies will be reproduced with exactness.  A group of dancing girls, executing the Nautch dances and certain others of the strange gyrations of these people, which have been dignified by the name of "dance" will doubtless possess attractions for people of an investigating turn of mind.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese village will be in evidence and the ear-splitting music and alleged singing of the almond-eyed beauties from the Flowery Kingdom will attract great attention.  There will be dwelling houses and bazaars, restaurants and theaters and opportunities for witnessing the sly tricks of the "heathen Chinee" will not be lacking.  As in other villages, the national dances will be strongly in evidence.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SOME OTHER FEATURES.</head>
                            <p>The Afro-American village will possess a certain air of familiarity for those who have lived in the southern part of this country.  The life of the negro in the south before the war will be depicted in the most vivid manner and the numerous dances with which the jolly, rollicking "niggers" were wont to pass their hours of leisure will be rendered with every detail.  The progress made by these people will also be shown and the village will be decidedly educational in its general nature.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the villages enumerated, there will be numerous other attractions, contracts having been closed with the following:  Shooting the Chutes, a wild animal show similar to Haegenbeck's famous show, a scenic railway, a Wild West show, the Big Rock, Night and Morning, a cyclorama, and a concession known as Rolling the Roll.</p>
                            <p>Shooting the Chutes, the wild animal show and the Wild West show are too well known to require any description.  It is announced by the Concessions department that these attractions will all be conducted on the highest plane.</p>
                            <p>The Scenic railway will be a small railway with open cars large enough to carry adult passengers and will pass through tunnels, over mountains, across rivers and through canyons, the scenic effects being produced by means of paintings with natural foreground.</p>
                            <p>The Big Rock will be a representation of a huge rock and upon entering it the visitor will find himself in a large cave opening onto a mountain ravine.  While he is gazing about him two girls will appear on the opposite side of the ravine and descend toward the spectator.  Reaching a platform in the rocks, they will execute a number of dances and disport themselves for the entertainment of the onlookers.  While this is going on a thunder storm will be stimulated by means of electrical effects and vivid flashes of lightning will illuminate the scene.  As the girls turn to run up the mountain side the path by which they came will be turned to a rushing torrent of water and his Satanic majesty will step from the earth at their side.  At the same time the flowers which cover the ravine will be turned into writhing snakes and the whole scene will be one of horror.  Electric effects of startling nature will follow in quick succession and the girls will shriek and pray for mercy.  When it seems that the culmination of destructive power has been reached quiet will be restored and the show is over.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LATEST ADDITION.</head>
                            <p>Night and Morning is one of the latest additions to the Midway, the contract for this attraction having been closed only a few days ago.  Henry Roltair is the projector of this amusement and he is reputed to be one of the most expert manipulators of optical illusions and scenic effects in the country.  His concession will occupy a pyramid 140x140 feet on the ground and 100 feet in height.  Upon entering the pyramid the visitor will reach a labyrinth, which will engage his attention for some time as he seeks an outlet.  When it is finally found he will find himself in a realistic reproduction of Dante's inferno.  Passing from an inspection of this the visitor will ascend to the next floor, where he will find a large number of pleasing scenic effects arranged with all the skill of a master in the art.  From this floor the visitor will ascend to the third floor near the top of the pyramid.  Here he will find the "heavenly cafe."  Just what this may be passes the comprehension of an ordinary mortal, but Mr. Roltair promises that it shall be a place of great attractiveness, where the waitresses shall appear as angels, with wings, flowing robes and all the other concomitants that are supposed to belong to the inhabitants of the region of bliss.</p>
                            <p>The concession known as Rolling the Roll is an entire novelty in this country, never having been exhibited on this side of the water.  It will be operated by three Frenchmen, A. Baron, O. S. Sarzi and O. B. Obergo, who operated it in Paris.  It comprises a huge tub, which stands on edge.  Seats are made at either side inside the circle and the passengers are strapped to these.  The tub is then sent whirling down a steep incline and hits a "bumper" at the bottom, which sends it down another incline to a point beneath the starting place.  The passengers alight and the tub is raised for another trip.</p>
                            <p>The cyclorama which will be exhibited will contain a representation of the famous encounter between the Merrimac and the Monitor.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Board of Directors Settles that Matter Without Question.</head>
                            <p>Although the newly appointed general superintendent of the exposition, A. C. Foster, has not had time to familiarize himself with the duties of his position, a question has arisen in certain quarters regarding the scope of his authority and the claim is made by certain ones that he is simply the superintendent of the Department of Buildings and Grounds and has no connection with, or authority over, any other department of the exposition.  The advocates of this construction are generally believed to be actuated by well understood motives, but the report of the special committee of the Board of Directors, under which this appointment was made, clearly shows the intention of the board at the time the executive committee was given positive instructions and defines the duties of the general superintendent as fully as possible without going into minute detail.  The report of the special committee to which reference is made was made November 15, and was adopted by the Board of Directors without a dissenting voice and without discussion.  The full report is as follows:</p>
                            <p>To the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition:  Gentlemen&#8212;Your special committee, appointed at the meeting of the board held on November 12 to investigate and report upon the question of the appointment of a director general or some other supervising officer, to promote the energetic completion of the arrangements for the exposition, begs to report as follows:</p>
                            <p>Your committee has held an extended conference with the executive committee and discussed the entire situation as fully as it was possible to do the president of the exposition and all members of the executive committee being present, and is pleased to report that a substantial consensus of opinion was eventually arrived at, that the present situation does not seem to make it necessary that the office of director general be created at this time, but that the work of all the departments might be energetically pushed perhaps more satisfactorily than by any other arrangement by the appointment of a general superintendent, a practical builder, at a maximum salary of $200 per month, whose office and headquarters should be upon the exposition grounds and who should be placed in charge of all work in the line of construction of any or all of the departments, with the express duty of overseeing and pushing all such work to energetic completion.  As the greater proportion of the work would be in the Department of Buildings and Grounds it would seem advisable to your committee that the nomination of such an officer should be conceded to the manager of that department, but that such nomination should be approved by the executive committee in the usual manner.</p>
                            <p>Your committee has had under consideration certain amendments to the by-laws touching the powers and duties of the president, but has not had sufficient time to conclude its deliberations on this subject, and would ask that it have further time to consider and report on the same.</p>

                            <p>Special Agent C. E.

He says the commission recently appointed by Governor Steunenberg will meet in Boise February 24 to organize for business and men will be put in the field to collect money for a state exhibit.  The plan which seems in favor is to issue certificates to subscribers, which the legislature will be asked to take up and return the money.</p>

                            <head type="sub">As Soon as the Company Provides for the Connections the Big Buildings Will Be Safe.</head>
                            <p>The turning on of water at the exposition grounds will relieve the exposition management of one of the most embarrassing predicaments which has been encountered in the entire history of the enterprise.  The question of water supply has been a most vital issue since the beginning of active work on the grounds.  Numerous plans have been suggested for securing water from other sources than the water company, but all of these plans proved futile when fully investigated and it was finally conceded by all who had given the matter any attention that the only practical plan was to have the water supplied by the water company.  When this conclusion was reached action was commenced to bring about a favorable arrangement with the water company to supply the necessary water.  The events following this decision are too recent to require repetition.</p>
                            <p>Recognizing the fact that the settlement of this matter would probably consume considerable time, the exposition management went ahead with the work of putting in a complete system of water main, fire hydrants, house connections, etc., and this is now ready for immediate use as soon as connections are made with the mains of the water company   Wherever a street was available the water mains were laid in the proper place to be available for use after the exposition shall have passed into history.  As the land occupied by the main court and the old fair ground tract has never been platted or laid out with streets and alleys the mains were laid where the streets will pass whenever this property is platted.</p>
                            <p>The location of the fire hydrants will afford ample fire protection to all parts of the grounds.  In the main court hydrants are stationed both in front and behind the main buildings and in the other parts of the grounds they are placed at frequent intervals, so that the danger from fire is reduced to the minimum.  The exposition authorities do not intend to rely solely upon the fire protection supplied by the fire hydrants, however, but preparations have already been made for supplying the exposition grounds with all the most improved appliances for fighting fire.  Portable fire extinguishers are already distributed in all of the main buildings and one large chemical engine is stationed in the main court and is manned by three members of the Omaha fire department.  Arrangements have been made for the purchase of hose wagons, chemical engines and various other apparatus of the latest patten, which will be installed on the grounds at convenient points.  The details of these arrangements are largely carried out along lines suggested by Chief Redell of the Omaha fire department and he will have general charge of the fire patrol of the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">One of the Greatest Attractions that Can Be Had.</head>
                            <p>"Music is one of the great attractions at an exposition," said Louis M. Ballenberg at the Millard last night.  Mr. Ballenberg, a resident of Cincinnati, is here representing the interests of the Bellstedt Military band of that city and is himself a musician of considerable renown.  "Everybody likes it and therefore should have it," continued he.  "Visitors to a great exposition like that which will undoubtedly be held in this city grow tired after a time of nothing but sightseeing and they wish a relaxation.  This is furnished by the musical organizations.  I dare say that one of the most pleasant memories the average visitor to the World's fair brought away with him was the music.  It was free as the air and the programs were rendered by famous organizations.  After tramping over the grounds of the White City, the people, I noticed, would seek a shady spot and there listen for hours to the melody of Sousa, Siedl or some other bandmaster's efforts.  Omaha should not forget this feature.  I understand that nearly all the best bands in the country have made offers to the exposition managers, but as yet nothing has been done in this regard.  It will not do to defer action on this subject too long, for it must be understood that the maintenance of one of these bands is most expensive.  Our organization alone numbers sixty performers, among which we have ten high priced specialists.  A manager of such an organization as this is very anxious to make his entire bookings for a season before he starts his men out on the road.  All the large bands, of which there are really only four in the United States, will soon have their routes scheduled and it behooves the exposition managers to move in the matter if they care for the services of any of them."</p>

                            <p>The Georgia exposition commission is traveling about all over the state, holding public meetings in all of the larger towns and arousing the people to the importance of having the state well represented at exposition.  This course is having the desired effect and subscriptions are coming in from all quarters.  The state exhibit, which is said to be the finest of its kind in the country, is being overhauled and put in good order and preparations are being made to commence work on the Georgia Pine Palace, the money for this purpose being nearly all in hand.  This Pine Palace will be one of the marvels of the exposition grounds.  It will be constructed entirely of Georgia pines, with "hard oil" finish inside and outside and will have the finest specimens of the beautiful "curly pine" placed at prominent points to add to the beauty.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The first installment of Colorado people who are coming to inspect the exposition and imbibe some of the exposition enthusiasm which permeates the air, have arrived in the city and are being entertained by the exposition management while information is being administered in large quantities.  The party was ciceroned by Commissioners W. S. Ward and A. T. Macdonald, members of the Colorado commission and of the Denver commission, who visited Omaha several weeks ago and were greatly inspired by what they saw.  They decided after returning home that the only way their fellow citizens could be aroused to the proper pitch of enthusiasm would be to bring them to Omaha to see for themselves that the exposition is to be the greatest American exposition ever held on this continent.</p>
                            <p>There are thirty-seven men in the party, all but two being from Denver.  Business men from other portions of the state fully intended to accompany the party but failed to make the necessary connections.  The visitors are a bustling, business-like body of men, and they seem to exude energy at every pore.  They say they are here for business and promise that Colorado and Denver will not be missing when the roll is called for the opening day of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The full list of the delegation is as follows:  Lieutenant Governor Jud Brush, Mayor W. S. McMurray, Vice President Edward F. Bishop, capitalist; W. N. Beyers, retired capitalist; F. A. Keener, vice president Denver Consolidated Tramway company; William Church, capitalist; S. M. Allen, manger Bradstreets; Max Kuner, president Kuner Pickle company; W. A. Hoover, wholesale druggist; S. E. Roberts, transfer business; W. S.

Bailey, general passenger agent Colorado Midland; J. E. Preston, general agent Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul railway; Fitz Mac, journalist; J. M. Ward, city editor Post; Willis Thompson, city editor Republican; A. T. Macdonald, deputy city auditor; S. N. Hastings, real estate; H. H. Roth, insurance; M. Morris, national secretary Retail Clerks association; Colonel J. D. Fanning, proprietor Albany hotel; T. A. Triplett, mine owner, Central City; J. H. Adams, capitalist; Colonel Goodell, capitalist; Warren Gilbert, sketch artist for Denver Post; Ardice Davis, plumber; John D. Bradley, real estate; C. W. Bishop, clerk circuit court; Donald W.

                            <p>The local committee which assembled at the hotel to accompany the visitors to the exposition grounds included these Omaha men: President Wattles, Mayor F. E. Moores, Major T. S. Clarkson, chief of the Entertainment bureau; Chairman William Neville of the Nebraska Exposition commission; Dr. S. K. Spalding, W. H. Roberson, Dudley Smith, W. S. Poppleton, H. E. Palmer, Rev. T. J. Mackay, Colonel J. J. Dickey, H. J. Penfold, H. S. Weller, Judge W. D. McHugh and W. F. Allen.  After a short time spent in getting acquainted a special train of trolley cars was brought to the hotel and in this the entire party made a quick trip to the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The main court was first entered, the party going into the Auditorium, the size, purpose and cost of which was explained by President Wattles, after which the entire party assembled on the bank of the <choice><sic>lagood</sic><corr>lagoon</corr></choice> in front of the Mines building, where President Wattles explained the names of the main buildings and the general scheme of the grounds.  From here a circuit of the main court was made, each building being entered and the progress of construction noted.</p>
                            <p>The visitors were loud in their praise of the evident magnitude of the operations and the magnificent plan which dominated the whole.  They commented very freely on the grand scale on which preparations are being made and confessed that what they saw greatly surpassed their expectations.  The general trend of the expressions heard was to the effect that Denver must have a building on the grounds and that Colorado must be represented in a creditable manner.</p>
                            <p>As each of the buildings was visited the astonishment of the visitors increased and the time consumed in passing through the immense structures seemed to impress them with the huge proportions of the whole affair.  The staff shop in the Manufactures building was a point of great interest, and many of the visitors watched the operation of making staff with great interest.</p>

                            <p>From the main court the party passed to the bluff tract and examined the buildings there under construction.  The location selected for the Denver building was examined and commented on, the opinion being general that Commissioners Ward and Macdonald had made an excellent selection.</p>
                            <p>After the grounds had been fully inspected the party returned to the city and were entertained at luncheon at the Millard.  This was followed by an interchange of courtesies and short talks by the visitors and members of the local committee.</p>
                            <p>Some of the party will return home this evening on the Burlington and the others will remain in the city until tomorrow and will return via the Rock Island.</p>

                            <p>George Clayton, northwestern passenger agent of the Wabash railroad, has just returned from Columbus, O., where he left the party of Nebraskans now touring through the central and southern portions of the country advertising the Transmississippi Exposition.  Mr. Clayton accompanied the party from here to Columbus, personally attending to the matter of railroad connections and assisting in other details of the trip.  He was obliged to leave the party on Thursday last because of the demands of business here.</p>
                            <p>To a Bee reporter yesterday he said: "This trip, in my opinion, will prove to be the most successful of any time that have been undertaken to spread the fame of the exposition.  The party is a large one and a representative one, and contains a number of good speakers.  Everywhere it is being received royally, and in every city and town visited the people are convinced of the real importance of the exposition and its broad scope.  At every place the party visited the leading business and professional men of the city.  The papers in all the cities were exceedingly kind, and invariably gave us from a column to a column and a half notice, besides locals for several days in advance of our arrival.</p>
                            <p>"We started in at St. Louis, and after the close of the Stock exchange there one of the party told the brokers all about the exposition.  Then we were entertained at the Manufacturers' club.  The next day we covered Vincennes, Ind., meeting the mayor and all the prominent citizens.  The southern part of Illinois and Indiana were crossed by daylight, and that evening we pulled in at Louisville, Ky., at 6 o'clock.  After a fine supper we had a big meeting and the interests of the exposition gained many real friends.  It was the same thing over again at Cincinnati, at Dayton, O., at Springfield, O., and at Columbus, O.  At the latter place the governor and the legislature were unusually cordial and promised the support of the state.  All in all, the trip will undoubtedly do more real good for the exposition than any trip that has yet been undertaken, and will certainly make the exposition literature that shall now be sent into that country read with much greater interest."</p>

                            <p>The first installment of applications from the large number of French exhibitors secured by Frederick Mayer, the French commissioner of the exposition, have been received.  There are nineteen in this collection, eleven of whom exhibited at the World's fair.  The names and characters of exhibits are these:  Emile Pinedo, bronzes, statuary, etc.; Fernand Martin, mechanical toys; J. B. Martin, musical instruments; M. Shorestene, hat makers' supplies; M. Besegher, varnishes; M. Carue, gymnastic apparatus; Ernest Carriere, mirrors and glass; M. Hubert, artistic toys, etc.; M. Renou, jewelry, precious stones; G. Vichy, artistic toys, etc.; M.

Vuitton, trunks, valises, etc.; M. Colmont, optical instruments; F. Mayer, collection of illustrated views of the Paris exposition.</p>
                            <p>All of these exhibitors are from Paris, and Commissioner Mayer says the exhibits made by them will be of the very highest class.  Superintendent Hardt of the Exhibits department, says he is personally acquainted with many of these exhibitors and knows that their exhibits will be of the highest grade of excellence.  Commissioner Mayer says he will forward another lot of application in a few days, and will have a fine collection of exhibitors in the French section.  He says the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris is giving him great assistance in securing exhibitors and in arousing interest among the people concerning the exposition.  He issues from his office special exposition pamphlets at short intervals and says the demand for them is constantly growing.</p>

                            <p>The injunction proceedings which have prevented the city council from paying the back bills of the water company are still pending, but it is expected that the necessary stipulation for dismissal will be filed within a day or two and then there is no apparent reason why the water cannot be turned on at the exposition grounds at once.  The stipulation has been signed by the attorney for Mr. Baum and is now in the hands of the attorneys for the water company and the signatures of its officials will complete the document.</p>
                            <p>It is not expected that there will be any hitch in the payment of the water bills by the city after the injunction proceedings are once out of the way.  There is no dispute in regard to the bills, and in fact $43,000 of the amount due has already been allowed.  No action has been taken on the 1897 bills amounting to $87,040 on account of the injunction, but the council is understood to be ready to approve them as soon as the legal barrier is removed.  The smaller amount can be paid at once, as the warrants are drawn and in the hands of the comptroller, but as the 1897 bills are provided for in the pending issue of refunding bonds there would be a short delay while the bonds were being disposed of.</p>

In addition to these there were a number of spectators, some of them having come as escorts for prospective members of the chorus, and others being people interested in musical matters, but who do not sing.</p>
                            <p>The singers were prompt in assembling and it was but a few minutes after 8 o'clock when Mr. T. J. Kelly, the choral director of the exposition, called the meeting to order and stated very briefly the object for which the meeting was held.  He then asked Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department of the exposition, called the meeting to order and stated very briefly the object for which the meeting was held.  He then asked Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department of the exposition, the department having direct control of the music of the exposition, to say a few words.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lindsey said he would not make a speech, but would merely say that it will be the policy of the exposition management to give the music of the exposition all the money that can be spared for that purpose.  He promised that his feature of the great enterprise would not be allowed to suffer, but will be supported in a substantial manner, and he asked the singers of this vicinity to lend the movement all the assistance in their power.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DIRECTOR KIMBALL'S EXPLANATION.</head>
                            <p>Prof. Willard Kimball, musical director of the exposition, was introduced to the assembly by Director Kelly.  He stated that this meeting was of greater import to the development of musical culture in the west than any meeting ever before held in Omaha or any other western city.  He laid especial stress upon the statement that the chorus now in process of organization would be generally regarded as the criterion by which people from other sections of the country will judge the musical culture of this section and appealed to those present and to musicians generally, as well as those interested in the upbuilding of the cause in the west, to lend their hearty support to aiding in the establishment of a chorus which shall be a credit to Omaha and the entire west.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Kimball then referred briefly to the advantages which membership in the chorus will confer upon those who identify themselves with it.  He spoke of the opportunities which will be presented for hearing many concerts by the most noted performers, including the most celebrated singers in the world, as well as concerts by an orchestra of the highest standing.  In this connection he said negotiations are now being conducted with several of the leading orchestras of this country and it will soon be known which organizations will be engaged.  Returning again to the benefits to be derived by members of the chorus, Mr. Kimball said the chorus will not be asked to sing more than once or twice in any week, but members will be admitted to the Auditorium on any day when concerts are to be given, and this privilege alone, he said, represented at least $25.  The practice which will be acquired by rehearsing before and during the exposition will be valuable to all singers, and all that each member of the chorus is asked to pay is $5 to assist in defraying some of the minor expenses.</p>
                            <p>In closing, Prof. Kimball called attention to the fact that the stage of the Auditorium is limited in size and will not seat more than about 225 singers, so that it will be necessary to limit the number of members to about that number.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CHORUS STARTS WELL.</head>
                            <p>This concluded the preliminary work of the meeting and Choral Director Kelly took charge of the proceedings.  Copies of the "Daughter of Jairus" were distributed and rehearsal was at once taken up with this work.  Mr. Martin Cahn, the well known pianist, was present and was invited to play the accompaniment.  The first chorus was taken up and no delay ensued in getting under full headway.  The singers entered at once into the spirit of the music and the number moved with a precision and accuracy of attack that was a source of great pleasure to Director Kimball, who was an interested observer.  The several parts were fairly well balanced, although there was a noticeable deficiency in numbers in the ranks of the tenors, but those in that row labored energetically and the volume of sound from that quarter was strongly in evidence.  One chorus followed another in rapid succession, interruptions and repetitions being frequent as little details were brought out, and the best of humor prevailed throughout the drill.</p>
                            <p>After an hour spent in this way Mr. Kelly announced that he would be ready Saturday of this week to try the voices of all applicants for membership, and asked all who desired to become members to come to his
                            
                            <pb n="25" xml:id="TMISB04-025"/>
                            
                            studio on that day between the hours of 2 and 5 p. m.  He then asked all who intended to join the chorus to give evidence of that fact by rising and every chair was vacant in an instant.  He proceeded to take the names of those wishing to become members and the name of nearly every person present was entered on the list.</p>
                            <p>While this was being done Prof. Kimball related briefly the various choral societies which have expressed a desire to come to Omaha during the exposition and give concerts, to all of which members of the Exposition chorus will be admitted without charge.  He said the exposition management will expend about $50,000 to make the music of the exposition a prominent feature and he dwelt upon the importance of such an expenditure in building up the musical standing of Omaha.  He predicted that it would result in the organization of a permanent choral society of large size and a high grade of excellence and the establishment here of an orchestra of the highest proficiency.</p>
                            <p>This concluded the business of the meeting and it was announced that the second meeting will be held in the same hall next Monday evening at 8 o'clock and all who desire to become members of the chorus were invited to be present at that time and place.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee yesterday authorized Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions to enter into a contract for a concession for an exhibit of infant incubators.  The promoters propose to erect a building in which they will install eight of these machines, each with a living occupant, and the tiny bit of humanity inhabiting each of these compartments will be in plain view of the spectators.  The concessionaires are Duncan Shepperd and Louis Luby, both of London, England.  They made similar exhibits at the Brussels exposition last year and at the Queen's Era exposition in London.  Commissioner Dudley Smith saw both exhibits when in Europe as the representative of the exposition, and pronounces them strong attractions.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed was also authorized to make a contract with Messrs. Obergo and Baroni to conduct an employes' and exhibitors' restaurant on the exposition grounds, where meals will be furnished those desiring them and thus obviate leaving the grounds.</p>

                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition has no warmer supporters than the thirty-seven Coloradoans who arrived in the city yesterday morning to inspect the exposition grounds and learn for themselves just what is being done to prepare for the great show they have heard so much about.  The citizen of Colorado is a boomer by instinct, and those who were in the party in question admitted that they had formed a dim idea that perhaps the people of Omaha were subject to the same complaint, but they freely admitted, after they had visited the grounds, that "the half had not been told," and they were loud in their praises of the magnificence of the preparations and the remarkable progress which has been made in getting ready for an exposition which they declared will be second only to the great World's Fair.  They promise that the Centennial state will not be missing when the roll is called on the opening day of the exposition, but will be here with an exhibit and the people will attend the show in great numbers.</p>

                            <p>After the inspection of the grounds had been completed the party returned to the city and were entertained at luncheon at the Millard.</p>
                            <p>The west end of the main dining room was set apart for the party and tables were arranged to form three sides of a hollow square.  The seats of honor were occupied by Governor Holcomb of Nebraska, Lieutenant Governor Brush of Colorado, Mayor McMurray of Denver and Mayor Moores of Omaha, Vice President Bishop of the Colorado commission and Colonel W. N. Byers of Denver.  President Wattles occupied the center of the table, with Master of Ceremonies Clarkson at his side, and the executive committee was represented by Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion.</p>
                            <p>After the cigars had been lighted Major Clarkson assumed charge, an ideal toastmaster, and his happy references to the several speakers kept the assembly in good humor and added greatly to the enjoyment of the occasion.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles extended a welcome to the visitors on behalf of the exposition.  His remarks were brief, but he said he wished to emphasize the point that the coming exposition is not an Omaha fair, but an exposition of the whole western country and that Omaha has simply been acting as the agent of Colorado and the other western states in making ready for the great event.  He said he took pleasure in welcoming a delegation which had come to see how its agent had been conducting the business in which they were all interested and he expressed the hope that the result of the investigation would be that Colorado will be present at the exposition with an exhibit and with her people.</p>

                            <p>Governor Holcomb was called on and responded with an eloquent speech which aroused the visitors to a high pitch of enthusiasm.  He commenced by expressing his pleasure at being able to join with his fellow citizens of Omaha in welcoming the visitors to the state and city and expressed the hope that they would return to their homes and give their neighbors a true account of what has been done in the way of preparation.  He hoped the visitors would feel that the enterprise now in prospect will redound to the credit of the entire west.  He declared that it is extending every day and already reaches from Atlantic to Pacific; the states both in the east and in the west are taking an active interest and will be here with their exhibits.  There will be no spirit of unfriendly rivalry between the states, but all will join in showing to the world the progress which has been made by the great west since the subjugation of what was once regarded as a barren region.  He invited Colorado to join in this great exposition and assist in showing to the world the magnificent resources of this great exposition and assist in showing to the world the magnificent resources of this great section, in order that those desiring to improve their condition may be able to take their choice from seeing what each locality has to offer.  The people of Omaha and Nebraska have done all in their power to prepare for the event and now ask the other states to come in and help in making the exposition a great success.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant Governor Brush conveyed the regrets of Governor Adams at being unable to be present.  The governor had told him to say that he is in full sympathy with the exposition movement and will do all in his power to assist in making it a success.</p>
                            <p>Speaking for himself, Governor Brush said he had heard wonderful accounts of what was being done before he reached Omaha and had been somewhat skeptical about believing all he heard, but after visiting the grounds all he could say was, in the language of scripture, "the half has not been told."  Colorada has been a little lukewarm toward the exposition, but he predicted that when the delegation of which he is a member returned home great interest will be aroused to the importance of being well represented, he had no doubt a way will be found to bring about that result.  He declared his conviction that the exposition will be a great success and worthy of participation by every state in the union and he predicted that Colorado will not be missing when the gates are opened.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores added to the welcome of the visitors, assuring them that the town was theirs.  His remarks were well timed and witty and kept the assembly in an excellent humor.</p>

                            <p>Mayor McMurray of Denver expressed the thanks of the visitors for the hearty entertainment of which they had been the recipients.  When he visited the grounds he had been greatly surprised at the magnitude of the plans and the advancement that had been made and felt as much interested in the progress and success of the exposition as a Nebraskan could possibly feel.  It is a matter of great regret with all the Coloradoans that their legislature had made no appropriation for participation in the exposition, but they hope to make up for the deficiency by arousing the people when they return home.  Colorado might not be able to put up a building, but the people will be here and they will come with exhibit that will not be made ashamed by the showing made by any other state.  He asked that space be reserved in the main building for Colorado and for Denver, and also put in an application for a special day, to be called "Colorado day," when the people of Colorado and Denver may come and visit the exposition and feel that they have a proprietary interest in it.</p>
                            <p>Mayor McMurray also served notice that Colorado will have a great exposition in 1903, to celebrate the "Louisiana purchase" and he invited all the people to come to Colorado at that time to help celebrate.</p>
                            <p>Toastmaster Clarkson declared that a day would be too short in which to take care of all the visitors who will come from Colorado and he announced that a full week will be set aside for that especial purpose.  He also served notice that Omaha and Nebraska will be on hand when Colorado holds it great celebration of the Louisiana purchase and will do all in their power to make that occasion a great success.</p>

                            <p>Manager Rosewater was called for and responded by saying that the strongest feature of the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be the exhibits of the states in the transmississippi region.  This will be the first exposition at which the greatest attention will be paid to the states of the union.  Washington and Oregon are the only states west of the Mississippi which have not taken active steps to be represented and the latest advices are to the effect that the governor of Oregon will appoint a commission within a few days, leaving Washington as the only state without representation.  Mr. Rosewater said he realized that it is difficult to make an exhibit without a state appropriation, but he referred to Missouri as a shining example of what can be accomplished by persistent effort and enterprise.  Denver, "the Paris of the West," should take hold of the matter and see that the state is represented.  He referred to the Mountain City as a thriving wide awake, enterprising commonwealth that has outstripped Omaha in many respects by sheer force of the energy of her people, and said the people of Colorado are equally enterprising, and will undoubtedly be represented at the exposition in a fitting manner.  Referring to other states which have been working without a state appropriation to ensure suitable representation, Mr. Rosewater named Wisconsin, which has collected nearly $15,000 and will erect a building; Georgia, which has collected several thousand dollars and will have a magnificent exhibit; Alabama, Tennessee, New Jersey, which is asking for an appropriation, but will have a large exhibit whether one is secured or not; Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and Pennsylvania, all of which are going ahead without appropriations and are bound to be on hand with creditable exhibits.  More states will be represented than were at the Philadelphia Centennial.  The people of the east are talking about the exposition and it is assured that at least 3,000,000 will attend the exposition.  Colorado must certainly take advantage of this most excellent opportunity to advertise her resources to the people of the world.  Whatever helps Colorado or the west will help Omaha, and vice versa.</p>

                            <p>Colonel Edward F. Bishop, vice president of the Colorado commission, a former schoolmate of Major Clarkson and a comrade-in-arms, was the next speaker.  He said he had expected great things of the exposition, but he had been more than surprised at what he had seen on the grounds.  He ventured the statement that if George Washington should look down on the earth on this, his natal day, his eyes would rest with approval on the fertile state of Nebraska and the great city of Omaha.  He declared that the men composing the Colorado delegation represented the best business interests of Denver, who had been brought to Omaha to see what had been shown them.  There had been no indisposition to make an exhibit, but efforts in that direction had been hindered by lack of a state appropriation.  A commission had been appointed and efforts made to provide for an exhibit.  A fine exhibit is assured, he said, regardless of what may result from future efforts, and the resources of the state in minerals, agriculture, horticulture and fine arts will be well represented.</p>
                            <p>W. S. Appleton told about the visit of the Omaha exposition to the Centennial state just a year ago, when the exposition was yet in its infancy, and the hearty reception that had been given the party by the people of Denver.  He spoke of the rough places the exposition had passed since that time and expressed the hope that Colorado will be at the exposition, assuring the visitors of the co-operation of Omaha in their contemplated celebration in 1903.</p>

                            <p>Colonel W. N Byers expressed his surprise at what he had seen on the exposition grounds, saying it was far beyond his anticipations.  He said he had no doubt the people of Omaha were surprised at the tardiness of Colorado in getting into line, but he was assured that energetic action will be taken at once and suitable provision made for participation.  The veteran surveyor then reviewed some of his early experiences when he first came to the west.  He said the ground where the exposition is now being prepared was then a cornfield planted by the Mormons.  At that time this section of country west of it was considered a barren waste.  He indulged in several interesting reminiscences of those early days when the Mormons were located at Kanesville, above what is now Council Bluffs.  When the Mormons started for the west the speaker went with them, returning to Omaha when there was but a single cabin on what is now the city.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock told of the difficulties of the party that visited Colorado on exposition business one year ago.  What was then

                            imaginary, he said, has since been fully realized, and the work that has been done in preparing for the exposition, he declared, will be a great revelation to those who have not seen it in course of preparation.  It had been said then that this exposition would be a great X-ray which would show to the people the vast resources of the great west, and he expressed the belief that this prophecy will be fully realized.  Colorado has been slow, but he believed what had been lost in time will be made up in energy and that what will be of benefit to Colorado will benefit also Nebraska and all the other states.</p>
                            <p>This concluded the post prandial exercises and the party dissolved.  Twenty-four of the visiting delegation returned home on the Burlington train at 4:30 yesterday afternoon and the other thirteen remained in the city.  They will leave on the Rock Island train this afternoon.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission held a meeting last night for the first time this month.  There was very little business transacted, principally because a good part of the session was occupied by a very animated and heated discussion.  Some of the members claimed the others were getting more than their share of the soft jobs for their friends and there were some very severe criticisms of the policy of employing alleged experts for the work to be done.  The warmth which pervaded the meeting extended to the lobby and a heated argument terminated in a fist fight between two employes of the board.</p>
                            <p>The trouble started over a very innocent appearing motion made by Commissioner Whitford.  Mr. Whitford is a horticulturist by choice and the affairs of the horticulture department have been regulated largely according to his suggestions, but when he moved that the board proceed to select an assistant superintendent of horticulture Secretary Casper's hair stood on end.  The secretary entered a most vigorous and emphatic protest against the appointment of any more employes until some kind of an agreement was reached by which some of the districts which have no representation on the pay roll should have a chance.  As the usually placid and mild-mannered secretary proceeded his ire increased and he demanded to know of the chairman if it was not a fact that the board had already appointed a superintendent of horticulture and an assistant.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Neville declined to be drawn into what he saw was likely to be an unpleasant discussion and he maintained a dignified silence.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Whitford's manner was gentle as a summer's breeze as he informed Mr. Casper in a tone of gentle reproach that it was true that the board had already employed the persons he had named, but he reminded the secretary, still in the same gentle tone, that the care of the horticultural exhibit would require the greatest attention and it was necessary to employ experts to do the work properly.</p>

                            <p>The reference to "experts" was like flaunting a carmine undergarment in the eyes of an excited gentleman cow and furnished a text for a dissertation by the secretary that was a gem.  He declared that he was tired of hearing about "experts."  "We are told at every meeting," said he, "that we must have an expert for this and an expert for that and it always happens that the man who talks the most about experts has some friend who is just the right kind of an expert to fill the bill.  The result is that we have got a lot of experts on our pay roll calling up the money and what do they amount to?  We have got two or three experts putting up our state building and one goes out there and orders a thing done this way and right after him comes another expert and orders the work torn down and done his way.  I understand that the cornice on our building has been torn off three times to please some of our alleged experts and the good Lord only knows whether some of our other experts won't come along tomorrow and say it is all wrong and must be done another way.  Now we are told we must have an expert to wipe off apples and put them on a plate.  I believe I could learn how to take an apple off a plate and wipe the dust off of it and then put it back again after I had been instructed eight or ten times by the superintendent and I believe any other hayseed could learn to do it in time.  I would like to know when we are going to agree on the number of employes we are going to put on the pay roll and have some understanding how the different districts are going to be represented.  I have not nominated a single man for a position under this board, and yet I believe I have as many applicants for jobs as any of the rest of you.  I believe all the democrats in the state think they must come either to Mr. Boydston or myself when they want a job under this board, and there are plenty of pops and one or two republicans who have made application to me.  I always tell them that we are not ready to hire any men and have no determined just what we will do, but it makes me tired to come here one meeting after another and see other members slipping their friends into nice soft jobs when I have to go home and be cussed by my friends for not having sense enough to get anything for my district."</p>

                            <p>The remarks of Mr. Casper about the alterations in the cornice of the Nebraska building caused a discussion between Assistant Foreman Watson, one of the numerous "experts" who has been in charge of the construction of the Nebraska building, and Timekeeper E. W. Crane, an "expert" engaged to keep account of the number of hours put in by the expert carpenters, expert laborers and the numerous other expert attaches who draw pay for their valuable services.  Watson said Casper was "mistaken" about the cornice being changed three times and claimed it had only been changed twice.  Crane forcibly insisted that Casper was right.  This counter attraction diverted attention from the proceedings of the board and those who could not watch the performance in both rings at the same time turned their attention to the lobby.  At this point the lie was passed and Watson jumped to his feet and struck at Crane.  The latter kept his seat but threw out his feet in an energetic manner and kept Watson at bay.  Before Watson could break through this guard bystanders separated them and attention was again turned to the proceedings of the board.</p>
                            <p>Member Poynter sided with Mr. Casper.  He said he didn't like to vote against the men who had been nominated, as they were friends of his, but he called attention to the fact that he had named but one employe of the board.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Whitford had sat silently through the indignant speech of Mr. Casper, but he said that in order to test the sense of the board he would nominate George Nownes of Sarpy county to be assistant superintendent of horticulture.  This motion carried with four votes "yes" and none in the negative, Messrs. Casper and Poynter not voting.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boydston then essayed to pour oil on the troubled waters by moving the appointment of a committee of three to determine upon the number of employes to be permanently employed by the board and to "adjust" the number between the several districts of the state, taking into account the number already appointed.  He suggested that he would favor allowing each member of the board to name the men to fill the positions assigned to his district.</p>
                            <p>This was carried unanimously and the chair appointed Commissioners Boydston, Poynter and Casper as the committee.</p>
                            <p>Before the storm arose over the distribution of "pie" Mrs. Helen R. Stires of Columbus, grand matron of the Order of the Eastern Star, appeared before the board and requested that the order be given a room in the state building for headquarters or be allotted desk room in the building.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Neville advocated delaying action on this matter, but Secretary Casper was in favor of "doing something" at once and coming to some conclusion.</p>
                            <p>This was discussed for some time and resulted in passing a motion instructing the assistant secretary to notify all societies in the state who want space in the Nebraska building for headquarters to make that fact known at once by an application in person or by mail.  When these are received the whole matter will be taken up and some definite action taken, the nature of the action depending upon the number of societies.</p>

                            <p>The legal technicalities surrounding the furnishing of water to the exposition seem to be about overcome and there is every indication that the whole matter will be settled very soon.  The stipulation by which the injunction is to be dissolved in the case of J. E. Baum against the city of Omaha, to restrain the city from paying past due hydrant rental to the water company, has been signed by Mr. Baum and the city authorities, and stipulation for the dismissal of the case of the Omaha Water company against J. E. Baum for damages on <choice><sic>accounnt</sic><corr>account</corr></choice> of the first named suit, has been signed by Mr. Baum.  Both of these stipulations are in the hands of Mr. Montgomery, counsel for the exposition, and he says he will turn them over to the water company as soon as he receives the contract for the furnishing of water to the exposition, duly executed by the officials of the water company, the exposition officers have signed it several days ago.  This contract is in the hands of Mr. Hall, attorney for the water company, and he says he is ready to turn it over to Mr. Montgomery in exchange for the stipulations of dismissal.  A meeting between the two attorneys has been arranged for and it is expected that these formalities will be disposed of at once.</p>
                            <p>The officials of the water company say that as soon as these preliminaries are concluded and the city authorities have turned over the money or other evidence of indebtedness to the water company the connection with the exposition grounds will be made.</p>

                            <p>NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 23.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The exposition excursionists arrived here at 9:30 this morning.  After breakfast they marched in a body to the Board of Trade, where they were welcomed by President Broumh, who confined his remarks largely to the growing importance of New Orleans as a port for the shipment of western products, stating in that connection that the Crescent City was determined to secure the lion's share of the ocean business of the great northwest, promising also to soon provide streamers built expressly for the import trade.  He stated that Louisiana was alive to the importance of transmississippi traffic and that the state would make a highly creditable showing; also the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Following the meeting at the Board of Trade the party was given a trolley ride over the city, visiting the great levee on the Mississippi side and being taken through the better residence portions of the city.</p>
                            <p>At 5 o'clock the delegation was escorted to the Jefferson club, where Governor Foster made an address.  He promised hearty co-operation in making the exposition a success, recognized the growing importance of the great northwest and believed New Orleans the natural sea port for the products of that country.  He also promised to be at Omaha during the coming summer and it is understood that it is his intention to take with him his official staff and a large retinue of Louisianans.</p>
                            <p>At Mobile the visitors were entertained by the Commercial club, taken up and down the river, viewing the immense lumber mills to the north and going as far down as the mouth of the government channel.  The party leaves for Baton Rouge tomorrow morning.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TUESDAY ENDS TIME FOR APPLICATIONS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Department Finds the Space All Occupied by the Most Desirable Class of Exhibitors&#8212;Making Out Acceptances.</head>
                            <p>March 1 is the date fixed by the rules of the Department of Exhibits as the last day of grace for the reception of applications for space in the exposition.  After that time the individuals, firms, municipalities or states which have not filed their applications for space will have a hard time convincing the authorities that their applications for admission should be accepted.  Another rule provides that no articles intended for exhibition will be admitted after May 1, and space not taken possession of by that time will revert to the exposition authorities for reassignment.</p>
                            <p>These dates are being very rapidly approached and the Department of Exhibits is growing in importance at a corresponding rate.  Acceptances of applications are being sent out as fast as the necessary surveillance <choice><sic>canbe</sic><corr>can be</corr></choice> had, and already 290 acceptances have been sent out.  These represent a large number of applications, many of them being for collective exhibits, such as are to be made by states and large concerns where exhibits are made in several different buildings.</p>
                            <p>The policy of the department has been to proceed very deliberately in the matter of acceptances, and only those applications have been accepted which are regarded as particularly desirable.  It was plainly apparent several weeks ago that the applications for space would far exceed the capacity of the <choice><sic>bulidings</sic><corr>buildings</corr></choice> and that it would be necessary to do a great deal of "weeding out" in order to select only the most desirable exhibits.</p>
                            <p>The acceptance of an application is followed by the assignment of the exact space the exhibit is to occupy and the plat of the building is marked to show the exact location and the amount of space thus disposed of.
                            
                            <pb n="27" xml:id="TMISB04-027"/>
                            
                            This allotting of space has occupied the time of Superintendent Hardt for several weeks.  He has devoted his evenings to the work in order to be free from interruption, and the main floor plans of each of the main buildings show that there is little or no space remaining unoccupied.  In one or two of the buildings there are two small spaces still unassigned, but these will be occupied within a day or two.  The galleries are the only hope of those who have not yet been assigned space and the limited amount of space in these will not accommodate a great many exhibitors.  A large amount of space in some of the galleries has already been assigned.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Hardt says that in making these selections from the great mass of applications on hand he has taken the greatest care to select exhibits which will make a complete and harmonious collection, covering the full range of the subject under consideration.  He says that his experience in such matters shows him that the exhibitions which will be made in each of the buildings will be of the very highest grade of excellence, and that an exposition is assured which will be, from an exhibit standpoint, one of the most complete and magnificent affairs ever seen in this country.  Every branch of art, science, manufacture, agriculture, mining and all the kindred industries will be fully and completely exemplified, with all the most advanced methods illustrated.</p>

                            <p>Governor Bloxham of Florida has enlarged the exposition commission appointed by him some time ago and the commission has reorganized and is doing active work.  As reorganized the commission stands:  President, George W. Wilson, editor Florida Times-Union, Jacksonville; vice president, Henry Curtis, immigration agent Florida Central &amp; Peninsular railway, Quincy; secretary, S. Boteler Thompson, passenger agent Florida Central &amp; Pennsylvania railway, Lake City; treasurer, W. W. K. Decker, sponge dealer, Tarpon Springs; W. R. Carter, editor Metropolis, Jacksonville; C. B. Rogers, wholesale merchant, Jacksonville; F. P. Fleming, lawyer, Jacksonville; John D. Peabody, physician, Ozona; M. R. Marks, Orlando; G. Lawton Bryant, merchant, Lakeland; George W. Scobie, merchant, Titusville; J. C. S. Timberlake, hotel proprietor, Rockledge; W. S. Jordan, agent Florida Central and Pennsylvania railway, Madison; B. L. Porter, farmer, Grand Ridge; G. A. Danley, farmer, Chipley; Eric Von Axelson, land commissioner, Yellow River railroad, Laurel Hill.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Thompson is the executive officer of the commission and he reports to the Department of Publicity and Promotion that matters are in excellent shape in the Flower state and that it is hoped that the state will come to the assistance of the commission and aid it in making a fit and proper exhibit of the resources of the state.  Whether this is done or not a good exhibit will be made, but it is the desire of the commission to have the showing as fine as it can be made and the assistance of the state would enable this to be done.</p>

                            <p>The congress committee of the Woman's Board of Managers and the special committee appointed by the Central Labor union to take charge of the proposed labor congress, held a joint meeting at the office of the Woman's board in the Paxton block last night.  All the members of both committees were present.  It was decided that the labor congress shall be held during the entire week commencing with Monday, September 5.  This date is Labor day, and it was decided that no more appropriate time could be chosen for such an event.  It was also decided that a committee of men prominent in labor matters should be appointed to take charge of the arrangements for the program and other matters pertaining to the fixing of the scope of the congress.  The personnel of this committee was the rock whereon the two committees split.  The representatives of organized labor insisted that men prominent in the cause of organized labor should constitute the committee, and the women were equally insistent that the congress should not be confined to organized labor alone but should cover the broad ground of social economy and include all labor, whether organized or not.</p>
                            <p>The meeting adjourned without settling this question.</p>

The building will be approximately 184x145 feet in size, excepting a small space at one corner where a detour will be made to avoid an obstruction.  There will be 18,606 square feet of floor space in the building as now planned, but provision is made for extending the building to the north almost indefinitely, as circumstances may require.

                            <head type="sub">Superintendent Hunt Moves Promptly to Care for the Arrangements&#8212;General Plan of the Service.</head>
                            <p>Water will be turned into the mains on the exposition grounds before the sun sets tonight.  Mayor Moores attached his signature at an early hour to the resolution passed by the city council ordering the payment of the bills of the Omaha Water company.  Even before this was done orders had been given to the workmen of the water company and a force of men was on the grounds making preparations to connect the city mains with those on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The exposition mains will be connected with the city mains at five different points in order to give a complete system of circulation.  The connection on which work was first commenced was at Twenty-fourth and Pinckney streets.  The big Twenty-fourth street main of the water company was tapped at Pinckney street at the time work was commenced on the water system of the exposition, and a twelve-inch pipe was laid to a point just outside the exposition fence.  A valve was put in at this point and the pipe "blocked" to prevent damage.  The twelve-inch main of the exposition system extends to within about fifteen feet of this valve, but the trench between these two points was filled in to prevent accidents.  All that remained to be done to make the connections with the exposition system was to put in the fifteen feet of pipe and a meter and open the valve heretofore referred to.  Superintendent Hunt estimated that this work would require the greater part of the day and he went out to the grounds early to personally oversee the work and expedite it as much as possible.  As soon as the work is completed the water will be turned on.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Hunt stated that as soon as the connection at Twenty-fourth and Pinckney is completed, the entire exposition grounds will be supplied with the regular fire pressure, but in order to make the system more complete and satisfactory connections will be made with the exposition system at Twenty-fourth and Manderson, Sixteenth and Pinckney and on Twentieth street at some <choice><sic>ppoint</sic><corr>point</corr></choice> to be hereafter determined.  He says this will give complete circulation and would make the exposition system equal to any demand that may be made upon it.</p>

                            <p>At yesterday afternoon's meeting of the Nebraska Exposition commission the Horticultural society of sarpy county offered to move to the exposition grounds the stone chimney of the first mission house erected on Nebraska soil, providing the commission would furnish the necessary space.  The offer was accepted, and the ancient chimney will be in evidence on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Former Governor Furnas offered his extensive collection of native woods to the commission for exhibition, and this offer was accepted.</p>
                            <p>A discussion arose among the members of the commission over a request of Kimball Brothers, the staff contractors, for instructions as to how to proceed in putting a strip of staff moulding around the base of the Nebraska building, and also making a claim for extra pay if the moulding is to be put on.  This discussion developed the fact that Architect Craddock and Superintendent Blake have been making numerous changes in the construction of the Nebraska building without consulting the commission, and have added several hundred dollars to the cost by this proceeding.  The strip of moulding spoken of by Kimball Brothers was shown to be one of these unauthorized changes, but inquiry developed the fact that the construction had been so changed that the strip could not be omitted without causing an additional cost of over $300 for making the change.</p>
                            <p>This development, together with the frequent changes in the cornice referred to by Commissioner Casper in his speech about experts, combined to produce "that tired feeling" on the part of the members of the commission, and after a short discussion Chairman Neville was appointed a committee of one to take charge of the building until the next meeting of the commission, and he was given full authority to discharge the entire working force, if he deemed that course necessary, and also to adjust the difficulty concerning the staff work in the manner that he considered best.</p>
                            <p>This concluded the business of the board and it adjourned until March 8.</p>

Their object is to secure a good choral production of the oratorio "Isaiah," the work of a Minneapolis composer.  In this connection the Minneapolis Times of February 22 has this to say:</p>
                            <p>Willard Patten's oratorio, "Isaiah," will be produced on a grand scale this summer at Omaha, as a leading musical feature of the Transmississippi Exposition.  Word was received yesterday from the musical director of the exposition, definitely placing the work on the musical program and agreeing in a general way as to the terms.  Minnesota's musical masterpiece will occupy a place of honor.  It will be sung by a great chorus collected from the great cities of the west, accompanied by the Thomas orchestra, which is to play five weeks at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The exposition management has agreed to furnish the Thomas orchestra for the event, also four soloists who shall be satisfactory.  The production will be in an auditorium on the exposition grounds, seating 3,000 people.  The plan at present is to collect a Minnesota chorus of 250 voices, of which Minneapolis will furnish the larger part.  Choruses will be organized in St. Paul, Duluth and possibly other cities, which will study "Isaiah" and come together at Minneapolis for a final rehearsal before going to Omaha.  Then the Apollo club of Chicago has already arranged to go and large choral societies of St. Joseph, Denver and Salt Lake City are planning to attend.  This will in all probably take up the work and after one final rehearsal with the orchestra the grand chorus of several hundred voices will produce it.  No selection of soloists has yet been made and it is among the possibilities that some of the leading lights of grand opera will be secured as features of the exposition and will sing the solo parts in "Isaiah."</p>
                            <p>The Minnesota commissioners have not taken official action in the matter, but a meeting will be held some time next week, at which they will no doubt officially adopt the oratorio as a Minnesota feature and they will probably ask that it be given the place of honor in the program which will open the exposition to the public about June 1.  Three members of the commission were seen yesterday by the Times and they were enthusiastic over the matter.  They said there could be no question that the commission would give its official endorsement.</p>
                            <p>The Chicago musical colony is enthusiastic over "Isaiah" and the suggestion that it be produced at Omaha came from there, in a letter to Mr. Patten from a musician who was to him a total stranger.  When the suggestion was presented to F. H. Peavey, vice president for Minnesota, he took it up enthusiastically and at once wrote to Omaha.  Willard Kimball of Lincoln, musical director of the exposition, heard "Isaiah" produced in an eastern city and needed no urging to see that it would be a strong feature for the exposition.  The work of a western man, produced in the west by western people, it would prove to eastern visitors that there was something here besides raw materials.</p>
                            <p>He at once sent a favorable reply and the matter was then taken up actively.  J. M. Anderson of the Metropolitan Music company was appointed a member of the commission by Governor Clough, who heartily approved of the plan.  A rough draft of it was sent to Omaha and the letter received yesterday endorsed it.  So nothing remains but working out the details.</p>
                            <p>Local musical people are enthusiastic and there is a remarkable sameness of opinion among them.  The usual professional jealousy seems to have been entirely laid aside and they are all anxious to see the oratorio produced and Mr. Patten given full credit for his work.  He will receive earnest support from the whole fraternity here when it is needed and Chicago musicians are enthusiastic.  Editor Mathews of Music, who so warmly commended "Isaiah," has put his shoulder to the wheel.  Carberry, the soloist, who sung the tenor role so successfully here last winter, has taken hold actively.  Singers the country over are using solos from "Isaiah" and the local work is being well advertised.  Its production at Omaha will be a crowning feature in its career.</p>
                            <p>"People in the east have an idea that we have lots of wheat and lumber in Minnesota, but very little else," said J. M. Anderson of the Metropolitan Music company last evening.  "We want to show them that we have some degree of culture here and that western soil produces something more than raw materials.  Minnesota should be proud of such a work."</p>

                            <p>The subject of hot roast beef sandwiches consumed considerable of the time of the exposition executive committee yesterday afternoon, that having been made the special order for yesterday's meeting.  No conclusion was reached, however, and the matter was laid over until today for the awarding of the concession.  There are about a dozen applicants for this concession and they are hot on the trail.</p>
                            <p>F. N. Mervin of Beaver City, secretary of the Nebraska Press association, suggested that the exposition management provide a building for headquarters for the visiting newspaper men and said the association would assist in paying for the services of an attendant.  The matter was referred to Manager Rosewater.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Difficulties in the Way of Making a Connection Overcome and the Pressure Turned on at Midnight.</head>
                            <p>The water mains on the exposition grounds are now connected with the mains of the Omaha Water company and the buildings on the grounds are protected against danger from fire.  The connection was made and water turned on shortly before midnight Friday night.  A delay of over twenty-four hours was caused by the conditions which were found to exist when work was started.  The frost had penetrated the ground to a considerable depth, causing great difficulty in excavating the trench, and it was found that there was no valve in the exposition mains near where the connection was to be made, so that it was necessary to allow the water to run into the excavation and then pump it out before the work could proceed.  These difficulties were surmounted, however, and the water was turned on.</p>
                            <p>The next step will be to make connections with the bluff tract.  This portion of the grounds has been supplied through an inch pipe with water for construction purposes, but a complete system of large mains was laid some time ago the full length of this tract and connection will be made with this system at Sixteenth and Pinckney streets.  Work was started on this connection as soon as the water was turned into the main court, and there will be no cessation until the connection is completed.  It is expected that this work will be finished some time Monday.  The other connections will be made as fast as possible and by the end of the coming week it is thought the entire exposition system will be connected on all sides with the water company's mains, giving a complete circulating system.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Commission Actively at Work on Exposition Matters.</head>
                            <p>That Oregon will have a fine exhibit at the exposition is now assured.  An active commission, composed of prominent business men and capitalists, has been appointed by Governor Lord, and will be organized for business at an early day.  It has been estimated that $20,000 will be required to make an exhibit, and the governor states that he has no doubt but that this amount may be easily raised as a loan, the subscribers to be reimbursed by the legislature at its next session.</p>
                            <p>This information comes to the Department of Publicity and Promotion from Special Agent C. E. Llewellyn, who has been in the state for a week arousing the public-spirited citizens and state officers to the importance of having their state represented.</p>
                            <p>This is a full list of the Oregon commission:  J. E. Haseltine, Portland, state senator; C. C. Beekman, Jacksonville, banker; Henry E. Dosch, Portland, president State Horticultural society; J. F. Batchelder, Portland, president street railway company; R. D. Inman, Portland, banker; J. A. Wright, Sparta, merchant; J. Henry Longmaid, Bourne, mine owner; J. G. Day, Roseburg, contractor and mining; Philip Metschan, Salem, state treasurer; E. P. McCormack, Salem, banker; H. B. Miller, Grant's Pass, president Agricultural college; B. F. Alley, Baker City (newspaper man; J. O. Hanthorn, Astoria, salmon packer; George G. Gans, Salem.</p>
                            <p>A mass meeting of all interested persons and of the newly appointed commission has been called to be held in Portland March 4, at which time the commission will be organized and the general plan of operations decided on.  The state has already a fine exhibit of fruit, grasses, grains and minerals and this will be used as a <choice><sic>mucleus</sic><corr>nucleus</corr></choice> for a fine exhibit.  The salmon packers are reported by Mr. Llewellyn to be very enthusiastic in the matter and are beginning active operations to install a fine exhibit showing the extent of the salmon industry of Oregon.</p>
                            <p>A meeting of business men was held in Portland February 22, at which Mr. Llewellyn presented the exposition in all its bearings and it was the consensus of opinion of those present that at least 4,000 feet of space will be required to properly present the many resources of Oregon.</p>
                            <p>Special Agent Llewellyn is now in Washington endeavoring to have the governor appoint a commission and provide for state participation in the exposition.  Washington is the last state to remain totally inactive.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plan for a Great Gathering Submitted to Exposition Authorities.</head>
                            <p>F. W. Wood of Cedar Rapids, Ia., president of the National Firemen's association, and E. I. Alderman of Marion, Ia., vice president of the same organization for Iowa, are in the city for the purpose of making arrangements with the exposition management for a national tournament of firemen to be held in Omaha some time during the latter part of the summer.</p>
                            <p>"There has been no national tournament of firemen in the United State since the tournament held in Chicago in 1878," said President Wood to a Bee representative.  "At that celebration there were 17,000 firemen in line in the parade, and it is evident from that that it is no small affair.  I believe if a tournament is held in Omaha and a fair amount is offered in prizes that fully 75,000 people will be brought here as a result of the tournament alone."</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Wood and Alderman called on President Wattles and presented the matter to him and also visited the exposition grounds with a view of determining whether a suitable place could be found there.  They were well pleased with the opportunities offered by the north tract of the exposition grounds and said this could be made to answer very well for the many tests of skill and efficiency which go to make up the firemen's tournament.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles agreed to lay the matter before the executive committee.</p>

The Department of Exhibits has been notified that, in addition to the 2,000 feet already reserved by this state in the Mines and Mining building, 600 feet more will be required in order to properly install the magnificent exhibit which is being collected.  Vice President Sutherlin reports that matters are in a very promising condition so far as making an exhibit is concerned and he promises a showing in minerals and all other lines to be represented that will reflect great credit on the state and also on the exposition.</p>
                            <p>In addition to its other exhibits the state will erect a state building at a cost of $12,000.

                            <p>Negotiations are pending for the engagement of one or more bands, and it now appears probable that Phinney's United State band, formerly known as the Iowa State band, will be engaged to furnish outdoor music during a portion of the exposition and will probably take part in the opening exercises.

                            <p>Mayor McMurray of Denver has called a mass meeting to assemble at the Mining exchange in that city tonight.  All members of the committee which went to Omaha the early part of last week will be present and make report of what they think of the coming exposition.  At this meeting it is expected that the necessary cash will be raised to pay for the Denver building, and possibly more.  All the money expended in this undertaking will be cash well invested.</p>
                            <p>The Republican has the following in regard to the Denver building:</p>
                            <p>Plans have been completed for the Denver building.  The cost of the building completed on the grounds is estimated at $6,000.</p>
                            <p>The structure will be on the lines of Spanish architecture, as applied in the colonies.  Its exterior ground measurement is 60x68 feet.  The material is timber covered with staff.</p>
                            <p>An attractive entrance through an archway leads to a porch, and from there a porch 16x15 feet leads into a lobby sixteen feet square.  This will be filled with Indian blankets, pottery, some mineral specimens and other things which the Denver committee may decide to exhibit.</p>
                            <p>From this room the walk leads into a rotunda with a diameter of twenty feet and a height of thirty-two feet.  On the upper line of the rotunda there will be a frieze of eighteen feet, representing the choicest of Colorado scenery.</p>
                            <p>Below this frieze there will be panoramic view of Denver and on a still lower line there are to be separate views of various parts of Denver.  All these photographs will be chosen from the finest that have been taken by Jackson.</p>
                            <p>To the right of the rotunda is a room 16x20 feet, to be known as the Colorado and Denver Bureau of Information.  On the left of the rotunda is to be a reading and writing room of the same size as that just mentioned.  There will be a ladies' retiring room.  Around the rotunda are to be located four connecting porches, one of which will be devoted exclusively to the use of ladies.  At the four corners of the building are to be situated four court yards, each 23x28 feet, in which will be growing Colorado flowers.</p>
                            <p>Work on the building will be commenced as soon as money for the purpose can be raised.  The location is the best and most conspicuous on the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">War Department Proposes to Exhibit a Pair of Them.</head>
                            <p>Captain Henry C. Ward, the army officer who is the representative of the War department on the board of control of the exhibit to be made in the Government building, has just returned from Denver, where he went to visit Fort Logan with a view of adding to the War department exhibit a couple of balloons such as are used during war to observe the movements of the enemy.</p>
                            <p>Many experiments are being made at Fort Logan by Lieutenant William Glassford, a signal officer of the army, who has devoted a great deal of time and energy to investigations in military signaling, and captive balloons have been made the subject of exhaustive investigations to determine their practicability in time of war.  These balloons are allowed to rise to a height of half a mile or more, being held comparatively stationary by a stout cable attached to the car and anchored securely at the land end.  The occupants of the car are supplied with telescopes to enable them to scan the surrounding country and the results of their observations are communicated to those below by a variety of devices in use in the army signal corps.  Signals are made by means of flags in the daytime and by flash lights at night, and in some cases a light telegraph cable is made a part of the cable holding the balloon and telegraphic communication is maintained below the balloon and those below.</p>
                            <p>Captain Ward hopes to have two of these balloons on the exposition grounds in full operation as a part of the War department exhibit and his trip to Denver was for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements for carrying out this idea.</p>
                            <p>Within a few days Captain Ward will start for the east and will visit the various government arsenals for the purpose of collecting a number of articles required to make the display of the War department more complete.  He will probably go to Washington before his return to supervise the preparation of the exhibit and give directions concerning its shipment to Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Department Will Receive Applications Until March 15.</head>
                            <p>A prolonged conference was held yesterday afternoon between Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits and the several superintendents of that department relative to the closing up of all contracts for space and the enforcement of the rule of the department which provides that no applications for space will be received after March 1.  Several of the superintendents stated that they had negotiations pending for space for exhibits of different kinds which they had been unable to close in time to comply with the rule, and they urged that the time be extended in order to allow them to complete these arrangements.</p>
                            <p>The recent action of the executive committee in authorizing annexes to be made to certain of the main buildings was discussed in this same connection and it was the opinion of all present that this would give enough space to allow of certain groups and classes of exhibits being enlarged.  It was, therefore, decided to accept applications for space for certain groups and classes of exhibits until March 15 and instructions will be issued accordingly to the various agents of the department.</p>

                            <p>St. Louis has taken the bull by the horns in the matter of an exposition to commemorate the Louisiana purchase and has already introduced a bill in congress authorizing the Mississippi Valley International Exposition company to hold an exposition in St. Louis some time in 1903 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of that event.  The bill provides for an appropriation by the government of $250,000 for a government exhibit and provides that all the details of the exposition shall be left to the company referred to.  The treaty of the Louisiana purchase was ratified September 20, 1803, but the date at which the exposition is to be held is left blank in the bill to be fixed by the exposition company, which is not yet organized.  The bill follows the general lines of the bill for the Transmississippi Exposition and provides for a government building to cost $75,000.  The bill has been introduced in the house and will be introduced in the senate also in order to expedite its passage.</p>

                            <p>Marcus Daly, the millionaire mine owner of Montana, has notified Governor Smith that his subscription of $15,000 to the fund for a state exhibit is available whenever the money is needed.  This subscription was made by Mr. Daly while the legislature was considering the subject of a state appropriation.  He sent word to the legislature that he would describe this amount if the legislature would appropriate a like amount.  This was done and the fund of $30,000 thus created has enabled the Montana vice president, W. H. Sutherlin, to collect an exhibit which will be very extensive and include many of the industries of the state which would otherwise have been omitted.</p>

                            <p>The demand for exposition postage stamps is growing stronger as the time approaches for the stamps to be issued.  The Department of Publicity and Promotion receives almost daily urgent requests from large firms in different parts of the country who want large quantities of these stamps for use in sending out their mail matter.  The latest big order is that of Fred Macy &amp; Co. of Grand Rapids, Mich., a large manufacturer of desks and office furniture, who want 200,000 of the one cent stamps.</p>

                            <p>The beekeepers' associations of Colorado are getting in line for a splendid display of honey.</p>
                            <p>The National Live Stock association, with headquarters in Denver, will have a permanent location at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>In the Arkansas valley district in Colorado nearly $10,000 has been raised for a display of the product of that locality.</p>
                            <p>The inspectors of the Colorado State Bureau of Mines report a very lively interest being taken in the mining districts from the various localities.</p>
                            <p>Mayor T. S. McMurray writes that the Denver city building at the Omaha exposition will be an architectural dream.  T. D. Boal of Denver designed it.</p>
                            <p>The secretary of Colorado's State Board of Farmers' Horticulture writes that some of the prairie states will need to look to their laurels when the Centennial state arrives.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Cederstrom of Lehi, an expert in onyx mining, is making preparations for an exhibit of Utah onyx which he promises shall excel anything ever seen in this section of country.</p>
                            <p>Denver will have a $10,000 city building at the exposition.  It will be furnished by the railroads and the women of Denver and be one of the most attractive features on the Bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>The state mine commissioner of Colorado is preparing for the exposition the finest mining exhibit ever made at any exposition.  It will occupy the central place in the Mines and Mining building.</p>
                            <p>Colorado's commission is actively at work on the state exhibit.  It's mining display will require nearly 4,000 feet of space, and as Colorado leads the world with its mining output something unique may be expected.</p>
                            <p>Robert W. Shingle, editor of the Hawaiian Star, a newspaper published at Honolulu, has applied to the Department of Concessions for the privilege of installing and operating a Hawaiian village on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee authorized Manager Bruce at its meeting yesterday afternoon to appoint a commissioner of mines and mining.  Mr. Bruce said after the meeting that he would probably make the appointment early the coming week.</p>
                            <p>The report comes from Nevada that the work of collection material for the exhibit to be sent from that state is making rapid progress and a fine exhibit is promised.  It will be especially strong in minerals and will include magnificent specimens of many varieties of ores.</p>
                            <p>The Massachusetts agents of the exposition appeared before the Massachusetts State Board of Trade recently to urge that organization to take an active interest in the movement to have the state participate in the exposition by the erection of a building on the grounds which shall be a reproduction of the Old South church, or Faneuil hall.  It is estimated that such a building would cost not to exceed $8,000.  The matter was taken under consideration by the board.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Visitors from the North Given a Pleasant Surprise and Find Much to Wonder at in Omaha.</head>
                            <p>The special train of the Minneapolis Journal, having on board the excursion party which was en route to Minneapolis after a trip extending to the City of Mexico, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Denver and Omaha, arrived in the city at noon yesterday, twenty-four hours behind time, having been delayed for that length of time by an accident in Mexico.  The party traveled in a special train of Wagner cars, having three sleepers, a diner, a tourist car and a baggage car.  There were eighty six people in the party when it started from Minneapolis, but one after another had been dropped at points along the road until there were but sixty-two persons in the party when it reached Omaha.  The delegation was made up of people from numerous towns in Minnesota, South Dakota and neighboring states, representing all lines of business and professions.</p>
                            <p>The party was met at the Tenth street depot by a committee appointed by the exposition management for the purpose, including President Wattles, Major Clarkson, assistant to the president; Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, W. H. Roberson, J. H. Barnard, W. G. Shriver, G. W. Lininger, C. D. Thompson, M. G. Perkins, John Rosicky, Frederick Schnake, R. F. Hodgin, Clem Chase, Miss Mary Fairbrother, Mrs. F. M. Ford, Mrs. Harriet Heller.</p>
                            <p>After greetings had been exchanged the party boarded special cars which were in waiting and were quickly carried to the exposition grounds.  The main court was visited first and as the full beauty of the buildings burst upon the visitors there were many exclamations of astonishment and delight.  They declared with great emphasis that the sight far surpassed their expectations and plied the escorting committee with questions.  President Wattles explained the name of the buildings and the general plan of the grounds to all and then the party made a tour of the grounds, visiting the whole tract.  The bluff tract was visited and the buildings under construction examined.</p>
                            <p>After the grounds had been fully examined the cars were re-entered and the party alighted at Sixteenth and Farnam streets, going directly to The Bee building, where they visited the business office and the editorial rooms going from there to the composing room and inspecting the type-setting machines.</p>
                            <p>From The Bee building the party were escorted to the art gallery of Hon. G. W. Lininger, where a pleasant hour was spent in inspecting the beautiful and costly paintings and other works of art.</p>
                            <p>The train in which the delegation traveled did not leave the city until 10 p. m., and the intervening time was spent by members of the party in visiting the various points of interest about the city.  At 10 o'clock the train left the Webster depot for the north.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Origin of Design of One-Cent Exposition Postage Stamp.</head>
                            <p>The Milwaukee Sentinel of February 17 prints the following interesting reference to the recent effort to secure a photograph of Lamprecht's painting, "Marquette Discovering the Source of the Mississippi," which is to form the subject for the design on the 1-cent stamp of the special series to be issued by the Postoffice department:</p>
                            <p>"Omaha's Transmississippi fair is to be commemorated by a special series of postage stamps resembling in a general way the Columbian issue which was engraved in honor of the World's fair.  As this latter series was composed of a number of typical tableaux celebrating the discovery of America, so the former is to embrace scenes characteristic of the exploration, settlement and development of the great northwest.  Among those thus chosen is Lamprecht's famous painting, "Father Marquette Discovering the Source of the Mississippi," of which a graphic sketch may be found on the first page of this issue.  The faculty and students of Marquette college are now treasuring this beautiful canvas with increased interest and pride.  This picture forms the only ornament of the austerely simple little reception room at the college, and next to the few relics of Father Marquette himself, it is the chief treasure of the institution.</p>
                            <p>"The picture was painted by an artist named Lamprecht, who lived in Covington, Ky., at the time, about 1869 or 1870.  The commission was given him by the Peter Claver society of Cincinnati, which is interested in the education of colored people, the donor being a wealthy resident of that city.  From the Peter Claver society it passed into the possession of the late Father Lalumiere, in his turn, gave the painting into the keeping of the father rector and the faculty of the college.</p>
                            <p>"Aside from the historical interest attached to it, the picture is a noteworthy one, for the artist, it is said, painted the scenery from sketches made by himself at Prairie du Chien.  The colors are soft and rich and the poses of the Indians and of the missionary priest spirited ones.  It is a rather interesting bit of gossip that the model for Pere Marquette was Rev. Father Weninger, a well known Jesuit priest of Cincinnati.  The Marquette fathers are not quite sure of this, but they are ready to assert positively that the cloak and hat put into the picture were certainly Father Weninger's very own.</p>
                            <p>"The relics of Father Marquette are even more interesting, both to devout Catholics and to students of history, though Father Buschart of the college is very careful about not claiming their entire authenticity, only offering certain letters as proof.  The relics are not on public exhibition, though forming one of the chief features of the college museum.</p>
                            <p>"They consult of bits of bone and pieces of wood and iron gathered from the ruins of the log chapel of St. Ignace by Father Jacker, who, wishing to ensure their safe keeping and disliking to have them buried under the monument erected to Pere Marquette, sent them to Father Lalumiere for the college.  Each bit is now wrapped in its separate piece of blue paper and carefully laid away in a tin box, which, in turn, with the documents relating to the relics, is under lock and key in a wooden casket.</p>
                            <p>"The letters of Father Jacker to Father Lalumiere concerning the transfer of the relics from St. Ignace to Milwaukee are interesting.  The first one is dated Hancock, Mich., August 5, 1882."</p>
                            <p>Considering the uncertainty of life, I would like to place my collection of memorials from Father Marquette's grave in good hands, and knowing of no other place where they would be better appreciated than in your college, I offer them, through you, to that institution.</p>
                            <p>My intention in taking these memorials with me in leaving St. Ignace two years ago was to keep them safe (whatever I left behind me there has disappeared) until such time when an appropriate monument would be erected on the spot where they were found and then to deposit them there.  But now it appears that the form of the monument already ordered to be erected by my successor in St. Ignace&#8212;Father Kilian&#8212;is such that whatever may be deposited therein will have to be buried in the ground.  Hence, when that good father insisted on my delivering up to him what I possessed of Father Marquette's (reputed) remains I sent him but one-fourth of the fragments of bones, together with a small collection from the divers articles (pieces of evidence, as we might call them,) found in the cellar and in the grave.  I thought it a pity that the whole collection should be withdrawn from sight, perhaps forever, and partly to prevent further molestation, but principally to secure its preservation in a more appropriate manner, I made up my mind to dispose of the greater part of the collection as said above.</p>
                            <p>Will your reverence then please let me know whether the reverend father rector and the faculty of your college are willing to receive that collection as a sacred deposit, to be preserved in that institution?</p>
                            <p>Should circumstances (i. e., time and money) allow me to go to Milwaukee, I would prefer to bring that treasure thither personally, and might on that occasion answer any questions about the significance of the several articles contained in the collection, as far as my ability goes.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully and sincerely, your reverence's humble servant,</p>
                            <signed>EDW. JACKER.</signed>

                            <p>The beneficial effects of the creation of the office of superintendent of the exposition is plainly to be seen by a visit to the grounds.  The work is proceeding with more energy than was apparent when every branch of the work was under a separate head and marked progress is being made in every line.  Superintendent Foster has been in office just a week and has devoted his entire time to the Department of Buildings and Grounds, gathering up the many threads in that department, and getting the work thoroughly organized.  He now has the matter well in hand and has commenced the operation of pushing things to the fullest extent.  He announces that if he is allowed to carry out his plans he will have no difficulty in completing all preparations and having everything in readiness to open the gates promptly on time.</p>
                            <p>The beginning of the end in the preparation of the ground of the main court has just been commenced.  A force of men has been put to work laying sewers to carry the storm water from the main buildings into the lagoon and as soon as this work is completed the underground electric light wires will be laid, completing the underground work in the main court.  The laying of walks and the completion of the embellishment of the main court will follow this work <choice><sic>rapdly</sic><corr>rapidly</corr></choice>.  The frost is almost entirely out of the ground on the north side of the lagoon, but on the south side the ground is frozen to a depth of over two feet.  Work will be commenced on the north side first in order to give the sun and other influences a good opportunity to thaw the ground as much as possible.</p>

                            <p>The buildings in the main courts are rapidly nearing completion.  The Mines and Machinery buildings are practically finished, little except the finishing touches remaining to be done to these buildings.  The Agriculture, Manufactures and Liberal Arts buildings are all in an advanced stage and but a short time will be required to complete all the work on them.  The Art building is ready for the staff contractors, and they will commence work on them within a very short time.  A large force of men will be put on this building, and it will be finished in a very short time.  The carpenter work is entirely completed, the skylights are finished and the staff work on the building is of such a nature that but little time will be required for its completion.  The greater part of the embellishment of the building is to be sculpture and Sculptor Bringhurst of St. Louis is now working on this.  A series of high relief panels will extend entirely around the building just below the cornice, the panels showing processionals of art workers of all arts and all periods.  The pediments will enclose groups of statuary comprising a seated female figure surrounded by various art workers bringing their handiwork for judgment.  Flanking the pediments will be groups of symbolic composition representing history, literature and science.  Crowning each pediment will be a single figure representing Fame.  Scattered all about the building, above the cornice, will be groups of cherubs, eagles and shields.</p>

                            <p>The Government building is making the most remarkable progress.  It is under contract to be completed by April 1, and Engineer Farnan, the government engineer in charge of the construction, says the building will be ready before that time.  He has already notified the several departments which are to make exhibits in the building that exhibits may be shipped at once, as the building will be ready to receive them by the time they can arrive.  The building is entirely under roof, except the dome, and that will be completely enclosed within a very few days.  The staff for the building is being put in place as fast as possible, and already the Government building is one of the landmarks on the grounds.  It can be seen from down-town with great distinctness, and when the upper portion is covered with staff, it will form a most imposing sight.  A staff statue, "Liberty Enlightening the World," fourteen feet in height, will surmount the dome, the pedestal on which the figure will stand being 150 feet from the ground.  All of the models, except the groups of statuary which will flank the base of the dome, have been received, and the greater portion of the staff is made and is ready to put on the building.  This will be the only building to be covered entirely with staff.  There will be no plastering on the outside of the building, the entire exterior being covered with staff.  The plain surfaces will be covered with slabs of the white staff and the building will be dazzling in its whiteness.  The ornamentation of both interior and exterior is ornate in the extreme, and is on a massive order that is both beautiful and very impressive.  Every detail is worked out to a nicety, and the building promises to be the handsomest structure on the grounds.</p>

                            <p>The colonnades which flank the Mirror and connect the Government building with the Art building on the south and the Agriculture building on the south and the Agriculture building on the north are nearing completion.  The carpenter work on the south colonnade is nearly finished, and that of the north colonnade is nearly as far advanced.</p>
                            <p>The colonnades flanking the Administration arch were completed some time ago.</p>
                            <p>The <choice><sic>colonades</sic><corr>colonnades</corr></choice> and pavilions forming the exedra at the east end of the main court are under construction and are making good headway.  The effect of the ornamentation of this exedra will be very pleasing.  There will be a high central pavilion spanning the space between the approaches at either side and two smaller pavilions at each side.  The colonnades between these pavilions will form segments of circles and the effect as seen from the west end of the lagoon will be very effective.</p>
                            <p>The north viaduct across Sherman avenue is making good progress, the girders having been placed entirely across the street.  The superstructure will follow rapidly and the entire structure will soon be enclosed.</p>
                            <p>The Power building is proceeding rather slowly.  The piles have been driven and the floor sills are in place.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska building will be entirely completed within another week.  This is one of the best, as well as one of the handsomest buildings on the grounds.  The finishing touches are now being put on and the staff workers and plasterers will be through their portion of the work this week.  The small amount of carpenter work remaining to be done will be completed some time next week and the buildings will then be ready for occupancy.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Chapin of the Floriculture department, who has charge of the installation of the fountain which is to occupy the center of the main floor of the Nebraska building, has commenced work on the base of the fountain.  It will occupy a space about fourteen feet square in the center of the main floor.  The basin will be decorated on the outside with staff and lined with sheet lead.  A handsome iron fountain will occupy the center of the basin and the whole will be decorated with handsome plants.</p>
                            <p>The Illinois building is in the hands of the staff contractor.  The staff is nearly all made and a large force of workmen have commenced putting it on the building.</p>

                            <p>Messrs. Holbrook and Hare, a couple of San Francisco men, are applicants for space for a mining exhibit which gives promise of being a very interesting exposition of mining operations.  They propose to construct a mining tunnel extending into the bowels of the earth for a considerable distance and showing the various methods of mining.  It is intended to show, in a graphic way, the appearance of a tunnel running through all kinds of rock; the different methods of "bracing" will be shown, and the meaning of the terms winzes, up-raises, inclines, cross cuts and all the other vernacular peculiar to the mining business.</p>
                            <p>The proposition of these people will be laid before the executive committee at an early date for consideration.</p>

                            <p>The Travelers' Protective association, a national organization of commercial travelers, will hold its annual meeting in Omaha at such a time that the delegates and visitors to the convention will be able to participate in the opening of the exposition.  The executive committee met in St. Louis Saturday of last week and fixed the date of the meeting for May 31 and the remaining four days of the week.</p>
                            <p>There are usually about 300 delegates to the meetings of the national organization, and the number of visitors usually swells the attendance to from 1,500 to 2,000.  Nearly all of the members bring their wives and families with them, thereby increasing the number considerably.  The traveling men will undoubtedly take a prominent part in the ceremonies of the opening of the exposition and will assist in giving the enterprise a good start.</p>
                            <p>Those interested in the exposition are greatly pleased that the traveling men will hold their convention at an early stage of the exposition, because, it is argued, they will be scattered over the entire length and breadth of the country within a very few days after the convention is over, and will circulate the reports of the exposition far and wide, being a most effective advertisement of the merits of the show.</p>

                            <p>Bids for the construction of the Transportation and Agricultural Implement building were opened at the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds at noon today.  There were only three bids, each of these being for the complete building, including the necessary plastering.  The style of architecture adopted for the north tract obviates the use of staff, the buildings being in the style known as mediaeval, or Swiss farm architecture, the heavy timbers being exposed and the intervening spaces covered with rough plaster.  This building is to be about 400x600 feet in size and one story in height, except in the center, where a clear story will carry it to the height of two stories.</p>
                            <p>These were the bids:  R. C. Strehlow, $37,775; Westlake Construction company, $41,692; William Goldie &amp; Sons company, $37,440.</p>

The supervisors of Los Angeles county have appropriated $1,500 toward a fund for a Los Angeles exhibit and a fund of $10,000 has been raised for an exhibit.

The delegates who visited Omaha last week made detailed reports.  Governor Adams, Lieutenant Governor Brush, Ex-Mayor Platt Rogers, Mayor McMurray and others made addresses creating great enthusiasm.  A committee composed of nine leading merchants were appointed to secure funds for the construction of the building.  The state commission is working with success in arranging exhibits for the different departments.</p>

                            <p>A rather novel proposition comes from Topeka, Kan.  The citizens of that town have raised a fund of $16,000 for an auditorium building and a proposition has been made to the exposition management by which the money will be turned into the fund for a Kansas exhibit, provided the exposition management will agree to turn over to Topeka the material in the Auditorium building on the exposition ground for removal to Topeka, where they propose to reconstruct it.  By this means they hope to secure a fine exhibit at the exposition and still devote the money to the purpose for which it was collected.  The railroads of Kansas have agreed to contribute $15,000 toward an exhibit if the people of the state will contribute a like amount, and the Topeka scheme would more than comply with this condition.</p>
                            <p>The proposition was made to the Department of Publicity and Promotion and the Kansas promoters have been apprised of the nature of the construction of the Auditorium building and informed that the exposition management will perform its share of the scheme if the people of Kansas desire to enter into such an arrangement.</p>

                            <p>The local committee having in charge the matter of making preparations for the Transmississippi Educational convention to be held at Omaha June 28, 29 and 30 has issued circular No. 1, outlining the plan and giving a number of details in relation to the preliminary work which will interest those having to do with educational work.  These circulars are to be sent to state superintendents of education in all of the transmississippi states with the request that they distribute them to the teachers in all of the counties and cities in their jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>The following extracts are made from the circular:</p>
                            <p>"The Transmississippi Educational conven- has been organized to promote the educational interests of the states participating in the Transmississippi Exposition.  It aims to give teachers and schoolmen the benefits accruing from a great gathering of representative educators interchanging ideas and listening to addresses of recognized leaders in the different branches of pedagogic work.  While following in general scope the meetings of the National Educational association, it seeks to supplement its work and extend its influence.  The plan and object of the convention have been endorsed by resolution of the State Teachers' associations of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Montana and Colorado.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DATE AND SCOPE.</head>
                            <p>"The date of the convention has been fixed for the last three days of June.  This will give ample time for finishing up the closing work of the schools, for attending the convention, for visiting the exposition and, if desirable, to go on east for the National Educational association.  The days of the week are Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  The time assures fair weather and moderate temperature.</p>
                            <p>"The convention will consist of five general meetings and numerous sessions of sections, departments and congresses.  For the general meetings the program will provide addresses by educators of national reputation upon topics of general educational interest.  The conference will be under direction of leading specialists in each field, as follows, so far as determined:  School boards, arranged by Hon. J. H. Trewin, Lansing, Ia.; secondary schools and colleges, President secondary schools and colleges, President James H. Baker, University of Colorado; rural schools; manual training; teachers of deaf and blind, Prof. J. A. Gillespie of Omaha; teachers of history, Prof. F. M. Fling, University of Nebraska; teachers of English, Prof. Hopkins, University of Kansas; teachers of science, Prof. Charles E. Bessey, University of Nebraska; teachers of music, Prof. C. H. Congdon, St. Paul, Minn.; teachers of drawing; kindergartens; child study.</p>
                            <p>"Those conferences for which leaders are not named are still in process of arrangement.</p>
                            <p>"Aside from the program outlined the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be the great attraction.  The exposition will be opened at Omaha, June 1, and it is conceded will be second to none except the World's fair.  In it will be represented not less than thirty-five states of the union, besides many foreign nations.  This exposition will be a graphic illustration of the resources and development of the western half of the American continent and will afford an education in itself.  One of the special features will be the educational exhibits now in preparation by the schools of almost all the western states, illustrating the methods and results of advanced educational systems.  Exhibits of text books, school furniture, literary apparatus and of the printing and book making trades promise to excel anything ever before attempted.</p>

                            <p>"There will be no special expense whatever imposed upon visitors except the moderate charge of 50 cents for the handsome official badge, which will entitle the holder to all privileges of the convention.  Voluntary contributions in sums of 50 cents and over to the expenses of the meeting are, however, acceptable and will be properly receipted with the official badge&#8212;a beautiful souvenir <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>"Special reduced railroad rates will be put in force for this convention equal to the best ever accorded any other educational gathering.  In addition, limits, conditions, and deposit privileges will be arranged most favorable to those who wish to attend the Transmississippi Educational convention en route to other points and have their excursion tickets available on the return trip later in the summer or fall.</p>
                            <p>"The general meetings will be held in the Coliseum, in which the national convention of the people's party made its nominations in 1892.  This hall has a seating capacity of 10,000.  The section meetings and congresses will be held in the smaller halls, with which the city is abundantly supplied.</p>
                            <p>"Entertainment is promised in the way of a special day at the exposition, special night illuminations, social receptions, and, if possible, a grand school and college parade.</p>
                            <p>"While the local executive committee and its subcommittees have taken upon themselves the preliminary arrangements and work of entertainment, the program is being constructed with the help of an advisory board, including members from the various transmississippi states.  The advice, suggestions and co-operation of all persons interested in educational institutions is respectfully solicited."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Members Becoming Deeply Interested in Their Work.</head>
                            <p>The second meeting of the Transmississippi Exposition chorus at Hayden's Music hall last night, was even more successful than the first meeting one week before.  There were a number of new faces in the seats occupied by the chorus when Choral Director Kelly swung his baton for the first number and the volume of sound was all that could be expected from a chorus numbering about 120.</p>
                            <p>The entire evening was devoted to Charles Gounod's "By Babylon's Wave," a most difficult number, full of traps and pitfalls for the unwary but one of the most beautiful concerted numbers ever written.  Director Kelly exercised the greatest care and patience in drilling each branch of the chorus on the difficult portions of the work and the members showed a degree of intelligence and interest which was warmly commented on by Musician Director Kimball who was an interested observer of the work of the chorus.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of the drill Director Kimball made a short talk to the members of the chorus, informing them that the celebrated Theodore Thomas orchestra has been secured for an engagement covering the first five weeks of the exposition, with a possibility that the engagement may be extended over a second five weeks.  This organization will accompany the chorus in all its performances.  Mr. Kimball called the attention of the members to the fact that this would be the first time this orchestra has played an engagement of over one week west of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kelly also talked for a few moments, speaking of the charge of $5 which is made for membership in the chorus.  He stated that a membership ticket carries with it the privilege of admission to every concert given in the Auditorium during the exposition and explained that this meant at least $25 worth of admissions, as a season ticket to the Auditorium concerts is already contemplated, these tickets to be sold for $25 each.  For their services in singing, the members of the chorus are to be given these tickets for $5 each, thus saving $20 by being in the chorus.  Mr. Kelly also took occasion to deny the rumors that are being circulated by some of his alleged friends to the effect that he receives nothing for his services except what is derived from the fees paid by members of the chorus.  He denounced these reports as being absolutely untrue, and stated that he received a fixed salary from the exposition management, regardless of the fees paid by members of the chorus.</p>
                            <p>The next meeting of the chorus will be held at Hayden's music hall Monday evening of next week, at 8 o'clock.</p>

                            the last meeting of the commission, at which time he was appointed a committee to take such action in the matter as the situation seemed to require.</p>
                            <p>After making a trip to the grounds and looking over the buildings, making such inquiry as seemed necessary, Chairman Neville announced that he found the building so near completion that he thought best not to do anything to stop the work.  He said the staff work would be completed within a few days and the carpenter work and all be finished by the last of next week.  One or two changes that were contemplated he had stopped and had left positive instructions with Superintendent Blake that no more changes of any kind should be allowed.</p>
                            <p>The monthly report of the condition of the fund of $100,000 appropriated by the legislature for Nebraska's participation in the exposition has been made out by Bookkeeper Dan Althen and forwarded to Governor Holcomb.  This report shows the following condition of the fund on March 1:</p>

                            <head type="sub">PRESIDENT WATTLES OUTLINING THE PLANS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Arrangements for Receptions, Parades and the Like Under Consideration&#8212;Display for the Opening Day's Exercises.</head>
                            <p>The arranging of programs for celebrations in connection with the exposition, special days, entertainment of distinguished guests, and all the other details which are a necessary adjunct to the proper carrying on of such a great public enterprise, but which do not properly belong to any of the various departments of the exposition, are matters which have been delegated to the president of the exposition to carry out, with the approval and advice of the executive committee.  President Wattles has, therefore, been giving this matter considerable attention of late and has perfected an outline of a plan for the early days of the exposition which will be laid before the executive committee at an early day.</p>
                            <p>The president believes that the opening exercises should be made noteworthy in every respect and should be on a scale commensurate with the magnitude of the exposition.  His plan comprehends making the event one of the most imposing celebrations ever seen in the west, surpassing in the extent and character of the military and civic display anything ever before attempted in this section.  He would ask the governor of Nebraska and the mayor of Omaha to issue special proclamations declaring June 1, the opening day of the exposition, a general holiday in order that every man, woman and child who can possibly do so may come to Omaha and participate in the celebration.  Invitations will be issued to the governor of each state in the union to come to Omaha on that day, accompanied by his entire staff and escort.  Members of both houses of congress will also be invited and arrangements will be made for a special train from Washington to Omaha.  The correspondents of the great papers of the country stationed at the national capital will be invited to accompany the congressional party.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the distinguished visitors every military and civic society in this section of the country will be invited to take part in the great parade which will pass through the streets of Omaha during the morning.  There will be military organizations galore and bands will be sprinkled along the line in profusion.  Civic societies of all kinds will be in line, and, to cap the climax, the concessionaires of the Midway will be there with their attractions, including the dusky denizens of the Afro-American village, the dark-skinned beauties from the Turkish harem, the Chinese artists and actors; people from the German village, Irish village, Streets of Cairo, Cosmopolis, animals in profusion, including camels, elephants, lions, tigers, etc.</p>
                            <p>The line of march will end at the exposition grounds and the opening exercises will take place in the Auditorium.  These will include speeches by various celebrities, music by the Exposition chorus, the Thomas orchestra and well known soloists and the reading of an appropriate ode composed for the occasion by some western poet.</p>
                            <p>Arrangements will be made to have President McKinley start the machinery of the exposition by electricity, and the exercises will be concluded in some fitting manner.</p>

                            <p>Entries to the individual competition instituted by the Woman's Board of Managers, for the purpose of securing a large number of meritorious specimens of children's handiwork for the educational display, have commenced to arrive.  The completion closes April 15, at which time the judges selected for the purpose will pass upon the merits of the various entries and award the prizes provided for that purpose.</p>
                            <p>This competition covers every branch of school work and it is provided in the rules that all work winning a prize shall be given a place in the educational display to be made by the board.  There are three branches which seem to be much more popular with the majority of competitors than any of the others.  These are drawing, composition and the transmississippi history puzzle.  The puzzle has proved a strong attraction and applications have been received by Secretary Ford from every state in the union, asking for copies of it.</p>
                            <p>Specimens of drawing have been received which show a high order of merit and articles of various kinds are being received daily.</p>
                            <p>The time within which entries may be made in the nature study series has been extended to May 15, in order to give competitors an opportunity to gather specimens during the early spring.  All other branches close April 15.</p>

                            <p>The latest news received by the Department of Exhibits from South Dakota removes any doubt that may have existed regarding an exhibit from that state.  Governor Lee telegraphed the department as follows:  "State be represented without fail; be sure to hold space for us."  J. P. Hymer of Deadwood, commissioner for the Black Hills region, writes that the mining interests of that portion of the state will be represented by an exhibit.  He states that some arrangement is being made by which the necessary money will be secured through the county commissioners, but he does not go into detail beyond saying that an indemnity bond has been secured and will be given to the commissioners.</p>

Mrs. Smith explained that she had learned that the federation could secure space in the Liberal Arts building for use as headquarters and she has filed an application for a space 10x20 feet, for which the Nebraska federation intends to pay the regular space charge.  The headquarters will be established in the gallery of the Liberal Arts building, near the educational exhibit.</p>

They need no introduction in the world of business and little, if any, commendation to the general public.  Here is the list:  Chauncey M. Depew, John Jacob Astor, W. Seward Webb, Henry B.

The model is now exposed to public view in the corridor just outside of the office of the secretary of the Navy in Washington.  It is said to be one of the finest models of a battleship in the possession of the government.  The model cost $6,000.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Proposes to Make Kountze Park and Bluff Tract Blossom Like a Garden of Paradise Before Summer.</head>
                            <p>Rudolf Ulrich of New York, the landscape architect who was engaged last summer to design and execute landscaping of the exposition grounds, has arrived in the city with the intention of remaining until the work is completed.  A force of men will be put to work on the grounds at once and no time will be lost in making the grounds "a thing of beauty and a joy" all summer.</p>
                            <p>There is an immense amount of work to be done, but Mr. Ulrich has the reputation of accomplishing more work in a given amount of time than any other man who ever attempted to expedite the workings of nature.  The prestidigitator who causes a rose bush in full bloom to grow in two minutes on the bare top of a table couldn't "hold a candle" to Mr. Ulrich.  At his command huge giants of the forest will rear their heads on spots never accused of growing anything more lofty than the emerald stocks of Indian maize.  Shrubs of all kinds, both flowering and non-flowering, will displace the rank growth of noisome weeds, and winding paths ending in cool, shady nooks, will transform the erstwhile prairie into a veritable garden of the gods.</p>
                            <p>The beautifying of the grounds will be carried on in all parts of the grounds will be carried on in all parts of the grounds at the same time.  Mr. Ulrich says the time is now ripe for pushing the work with all possible speed, and he hopes to complete the work of planting trees, shrubs, etc., within the next two or three weeks.  A number of trees have been transplanted to the bluff tract, bordering the main avenue leading from the Grand Plaza to the Horticulture building.  In the main court a row of Lombardy poplars has been planted in front of the Manufactures and Agriculture buildings.  These are between thirty and forty feet in height.  A lot of box elder trees about twenty feet in height are on the ground ready to be placed near the poplars, the latter standing at the top and the former at the bottom of a terrace extending along the entire front of these buildings.</p>
                            <p>The space between the Machinery and Manufactures buildings, as well as that between the Mines and Liberal Arts buildings, will be parked in an attractive style and the same may be said of the space between the Liberal Arts and the Art building, on either side of the main entrance.</p>

                            <p>NORTH PLATTE, March 2.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  I have selected Miss May O'Shea of Lincoln and Miss Netta Harmer of Syracuse for the composite photograph (exposition medal) and have forwarded the photos to Chairman Lindsay.  I have positive proof that Nebraska has more beautiful women than any state in the union, and the decorations in the Nebraska headquarters, as well as the medal, will confirm my statement.

                            <p>Choral Director Kelly said, when asked about the exposition chorus this morning, that the chorus is filling up rapidly and making good progress.  The executive committee considers having future meetings of the chorus in the Board of Trade building.  Prof. Kelly will try voices at his studio in the Boyd theater building next Saturday from 2 till 5 p. m.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Chambers is organizing an auxiliary chorus in Council Bluffs, and will train his singers under the direction of the Omaha management.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kelly says that he is glad to find that musical people are realizing that the exposition chorus is not a private undertaking, but a society organized by and under the direct control of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  It is a thing of national interest and the persons who remain out of it will be the losers.  Monday night the chorus will take up "Daughter of Jairus" by Dr. Stainer, and also the Easter hymn from "Cavalleria Rusticana."</p>

                            <p>The Douglas County Horticultural society held a meeting at the Commercial club yesterday afternoon to discuss ways and means of having a county exhibit at the exposition.  The society had a conference with the county commissioners a few days ago with a view of securing a portion of the proceeds of the county exposition bonds for such an exhibit, but no satisfactory conclusion was reached.  The report of the result of this conference formed the basis of the discussion at yesterday's meeting.</p>
                            <p>It was finally decided that the only way in which a county exhibit can be made is through such an appropriation, inasmuch as the members of the society feel that they cannot afford to subscribe any money for the purpose.  A communication will be sent to the county commissioners soliciting the appropriation of a sum for the exhibit and recommending, in case the appropriation is passed and the exhibit is made, that it be put in charge of W. L. Crosby.</p>

                            <p>The contract with Concessionaire Swobe, who has had charge of the skating and toboggan slide on the exposition grounds, will expire Tuesday of next week and the full control of admission to the grounds will on that date pass into the hands of the bureau of admissions, of which Manager Lindsey is the chairman.  No attempt has been made to restrict admission into any part of the grounds except the main court and no change in that respect is contemplated in the near future.

The plater contractors concluded to work their men last Sunday on account of the fine weather and after the day had passed the men put in a claim for "double time," as provided by the union scale of wages for Sunday work.  The contractors refused to allow the extra pay and the local union at once took up the matter.  It will be laid before the Nebraska commission at the next meeting and the contractors will probably be required to comply with the demands of the men.

He also has 225 water colors and drawings in black and white, making a total of 500, besides the large number of paintings in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Washington and Philadelphia which are available, and another large lot from New York artists who have promised to send their pictures after the close of the spring exhibitions in the east.</p>

It is to be constructed entirely of Arkansas lumber and is to cost not to exceed $7,500.  The architects are given until March 10 to submit plans and the successful competitor must submit plans and the successful competitor must submit full specification not later than March 20.

                            <head type="sub">GREAT FEATURE OF THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Chief Redell and Major Clarkson Working on a Plan to Bring Together the Firemen of the Country.</head>
                            <p>Major T. S. Clarkson, the assistant to the president, is engaged in arranging plans for the national tournament of firemen which is proposed by President Wood of the National Firemen's association, who was in Omaha a short time ago to confer with the exposition officials regarding the matter.  As soon as a definite plan is outlined it will be laid before the executive committee for ratification.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Clarkson has been in consultation with Chief Redell of the Omaha Fire department regarding arrangements for the tournament and says that the chief has entered most heartily into the spirit of the thing.  It is conceded that such a tournament would attract thousands of people from all sections of the country.  The last national tournament was held in Chicago in 1878, and there were 15,000 firemen in the parade.  It is estimated that a tournament in Omaha would attract fully 25,000 firemen and three or four times that many visitors.  The last twenty years has seen many changes in the methods of fighting fires, and a great increase in the number of firemen employed.  The tournament proposed includes the volunteers, as well as the paid fire departments, and it is conceded that there has been a great increase in the number of both classes since the last tournament.</p>
                            <p>One of the most essential features of a firemen's tournament, and, in fact, the principal object of the tournament, is tests of skill in fighting fires.  The plan which has been contemplated by Major Clarkson and Chief Redell, although not fully matured, includes the erection of a temporary structure several stories in height, in some open space which is to be fired and the several companies contesting for supremacy given an opportunity to show their speed and activity.  This would give opportunity for the use of pompier ladders, and all the most modern inventions for fire fighting.  Purses of sufficient size to induce hot competition will be offered in the several classes.</p>
                            <p>Those who have kept in touch with the matter in its preliminary stages feel certain that arrangements will soon be made that will be entirely satisfactory to all concerned and that the largest and most successful tournament of firemen ever held in this country will eventuate in Omaha during the coming summer.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Money Enough in Sight to Pay All the Expenses.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association held a meeting last night that kept the members talking until nearly midnight.  The matters that called forth the chief discussion related to the affairs of the committee and the large undertakings in hand.  It was an earnest, practical discussion of some problems that have been up for solution for some time, and which the association felt must be solved at once.  The discussion resulted in a satisfactory adjustment and the association proceeded to the consideration of the other business, chiefly that connected with the erection of the big wigwam.  President Graham and George F. Knight reported that they had closed the contract for the site of the building on the exposition ground and obligated the association to pay the first installment of the rental, $250, at once.  It was found that the site originally selected had been leased to a Chinese Midway attraction for $3,000, but the exposition management agreed to cancel the contract with the orientals and give the chosen site to the Council Bluffs association.  The amount of the first installment was ordered paid at once.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wright reported that he had received a telegram from Representative Potter in Des Moines announcing that the Pottawattamie delegation had been before the legislative appropriation committee in regard to the appropriation to be made for the Iowa exhibit and had been well received.  The telegram suggested that it would be well for the association to send a special committee of its members to Des Moines and assist in convincing the legislative committee that a liberal appropriation was a necessity.  The suggestion was favorably acted upon and the members of the association's appropriation committee were ordered to go to Des Moines at once and co-operate with the county's delegation and other friends of the exposition.  While the subject was up Mayor Carson spoke very earnestly in favor of a large Iowa exhibit and a suitable building to show it.  He declared that Iowa should exceed Nebraska in the liberality of its treatment of the exposition, and that no cry of poverty should be permitted to interfere with the showing the state should make.  Reverting to the question of the wigwam, Mr. Moore suggested that all of the agents of eastern manufacturers and wholesalers be asked to solicit their houses to make special exhibits in the wigwam.  He thought that several thousand dollars could be raised by this means that would help to make the wigwam the success that the people desired it should</p>
                            <p>The financial report showed that there was in sight about $8,500 for use in buildings the wigwam and making the exhibits.  The total expenses that had been figured out amounted to about $7,000.</p>
                            <p>A resolution was passed making the president of the association the executive head of the wigwam committee and obliging him to spend part of each day in the office of the secretary for the purpose of advising and directing the work.  The plan was discussed of building the wigwam under the immediate direction of the association, employing a suitable superintendent and the association buying all the material.  The same resolution required the secretary for the next three months to devote all of his time to the work of the association and provided that his compensation should be $100 a month.  This portion of the resolution was laid on the table, with the understanding that the secretary would be paid after his work was done, but that no money collected for the purpose of erecting the building should be used in the payment of any salaries.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed to confer with the representatives of the women's clubs reported that the women were anxious to assist in the work, and had plastered a series of entertainments by which it was expected to raise $1,000.</p>

                            <p>At a conference held by Mr. Richardson with the leaders in both houses of the Ohio legislature it was agreed that a joint resolution would be introduced providing for the appointment of a state exposition commission and making an appropriation for a state exhibit.  The Board of Trade of Columbus passed a resolution urging that the state should be properly and creditably represented and requesting the legislature to appropriate funds for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>The Commercial club of Louisville, Ky., passed a series of resolutions declaring it to be to the best interests of the manufacturing, agricultural and mineral industries of the state to be represented and urging all interested to assist.

                            <head type="sub">Cash Register People on Prosperity in the West.</head>
                            <p>William P. Kiser of Dayton, O.fl, general manager of the National Cash Register company, is in the city endeavoring to make suitable arrangements for an elaborate exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.  If he is successful in securing the space he wants he will put in a display similar to the famous pearl and gold one which took first prizes for grandeur in display at the Antwerp exposition.  Mr. Kiser is in Omaha after a trip through the west, and says he is thoroughly convinced of <choice><sic>th</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> return of prosperity to this section.</p>
                            <p>To a Bee reporter he said:  "Our sales are better by two to one than they were a year ago in the west, and the collections are much better.  To my mind these are two accurate indices to the commercial condition of any territory.  Our business has improved all over the country, but the improvement has been more marked in the west than in the east.  This is true in regard to both sales and collections.  That Omaha stands in the very lead in the enjoyment of the returned prosperity is indicated by the return of our Omaha agent, H. B. Whitehouse.  Our company makes an award of $100 every month for the best returns, various standards being fixed for different territories according to their respective population.  During 1897 Mr. Whitehouse secured seven out of a possible twelve of these monthly awards, and he was in competition with agents all over the world.  He has already won the prize for January, 1898, and I think he also has that for February, 1898, although all the returns are not yet in.  More than that he has just been awarded the $200 silver cup offered annually for the best knowledge of the firm's business, and also the annual diploma for the highest general average in all departments of the business for the year 1897.  This remarkable collection of prizes by one agent indicates more than exceptional ability on his part.  It goes to show that the territory in which he is representing the company is enjoying a full measure of the commercial improvement that is noticeable all over the county."</p>

                            <head type="sub">MISSOURI'S MONEY IS COMING IN.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Contract for Its State Building Will Soon Be Awarded.</head>
                            <p>ST. LOUIS, March 4.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;A meeting of the executive committee of the Omaha Exposition commission will probably be called within the next ten days, for the purpose of awarding a contract for the erection of a state building on the exposition grounds.  The call will be issued by the chairman, Colonel John O'Day of Springfield and meantime the aspiring architects will complete their plans and submit the same to the committee.</p>
                            <p>The necessary ground pace for the Missouri exhibit has already been secured by the president of the commission, Clark H. Sampson, and the locality is said to be a desirable one.  It is the intention of the commission to not expend over $10,000 on a building as it is deemed this sum will be amply sufficient for a temporary structure.</p>
                            <p>The main work now ahead of the commission is to secure the necessary money to make the Missouri exhibit a complete success.  At the recent meeting in Kansas City some $26,000 was reported as having been collected, and nearly all of this came from the cities.  The country is yet to hear from and letters of inquiry have been sent out with a view of learning just how much each county can be depended upon to furnish in ready cash.</p>
                            <p>The commission estimates that it will require not less than $50,000 to make anything like such an exhibit as the state should have, and it is thought that a considerably larger sum could be expended to good advantage.  Most of the city subscriptions have been collected and by the time the next meeting of the executive committee is held it is thought they will all be in the hands of the treasurer.  It is not known at this time how much money has been subscribed in the country.  Many of the county courts have made appropriations, but in most cases small sums were voted.</p>
                            <p>Anticipating that there will be difficulties in the road of raising sufficient funds in the usual way, the committee has resorted to another method for obtaining small contributions.  A handsome exposition button, or badge, as some call it, has been secured.  It is duly inscribed as a Missouri Exposition button and has the seal of the state stamped in the center.  Persons desiring to possess one of these souvenirs can do so by enclosing their address and $1 to the treasurer, F. C. Marshall cashier of the St. Louis Continental Bank.  All money arising from the sale of these buttons will be turned into the general exposition funds.  The committee expects that a large number of them will be disposed of during the next few days.  Letters have been sent out by the secretary calling attention to the souvenirs.</p>
                            <p>Assurances are coming in to the executive committee from all parts of the state from individuals and corporations stating that they will need space for their exhibits and when all these are added to the exhibit of the state now being provided for it is believed that Missouri will easily walk away with first premium.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Managers of Departments Make Encouraging Reports.</head>
                            <p>The Colorado Exposition commission is meeting with great encouragement in its efforts to have a fine exhibit of the many resources of the state.  At a meeting held in the governor's office Wednesday night, reports were received which indicate that exposition matters are in a very good condition and a large and fine exhibit is assured.  State Mining Commissioner Lee reported that $8,000 will be required for a creditable mining exhibit and he said a good share of this had already been secured and pledges were given to guarantee the balance.  Mrs. M. A. Shute, secretary of the State Board of Horticulture, who is in charge of the horticulture exhibit, reported that the friendly rivalry between the various sections of the state made it certain that plenty of money will be available for a fine exhibit of fruit extending through the entire exposition.  Colonel R. E. Goodell, chairman of the department of coal, iron and oil, presented assurances from leading people connected with these industries of a fine exhibit in all these lines.  The members of the commission were greatly pleased at the outlook and no stone will be left unturned to make the Colorado exhibit all that could be desired.  The state has been assigned the most prominent position in the Mines building and the mining exhibit will be made especially fine on that account.</p>
                            <p>The Denver commission also held a meeting Wednesday night and it was found that there will be no difficulty whatever in raising sufficient funds for the erection of the proposed Denver building.</p>

The Chamber of Commerce of Indianapolis endorses the idea of having the state well represented at the exposition and urges the governor to take action on the matter.  The legislature of Indiana is not in session, and the commission will be compelled to rely upon private subscriptions for funds with which to make an exhibit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Board of Governors on the Matter of Giving Up Ak-Sar-Ben's Den.</head>
                            <p>There is said to be some question whether the exposition association will be able to use the old Coliseum building for conventions and other gatherings during the summer.  No arrangement has yet been made with the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, who control the property, and it is understood that some of the members of the board of governors are now opposed to any change in their program.</p>
                            <p>The members of the board of governors state that in the first place they offered to allow the exposition people to use the building if they would construct a shed immediately adjoining that would answer for the storage of the floats.  No answer was given to this proposition and the knights went ahead and made their plans, which involve the use of the old building.  Within the last day or two the exposition officials have decided that they want the building, and at this late day the knights cannot change their plans without serious inconvenience.  The matter will be taken up at the meeting of the board of governors next Tuesday night, when a final answer to the exposition association will be determined on.</p>
                            <p>Major R. S. Wilcox said that the board of governors was willing to oblige the exposition people if possible.  But the matter had been allowed to rest until so late a say that it was feared that it might interfere with their plans to give up the building.  The matter will be thoroughly canvassed Tuesday night and as far as he understands the sentiment of the board the request will be granted if it can be done without too much disarrangement of their plans.</p>
                            <p>H. J. Penfold said that it is unfortunate that the exposition people had not seen fit to accept the proposition made by the board of governors in the first place.  The board has now gone so far with its plans that it will be difficult to change them.  Whether it can be done at all is to be settled Tuesday night and until the board has discussed the matter it is impossible to say what action it will take.</p>

                            <head type="main">PROTECTION AGAINST FIRE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exposition Has a Separate and Distinct Fire Department.</head>
                            <head type="sub">IT IS MANNED WITH THE VERY BEST OF MEN</head>
                            <head type="sub">In Addition to the Engines, Stand Pipes Are Placed in Buildings for Use in Case of a Conflagration.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The protection of an exposition against fire is always a vital question and one which causes the management of any enterprise of that nature a great deal of uneasiness until the exposition is safely brought to a close and everything is removed from the grounds.  The Transmississippi Exposition is no exception to this general rule and a great deal of thought has been devoted to this particular department.  The entire charge of the grounds of the exposition, including the buildings, is vested in the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  Manager Kirkendall of that department has been giving a great deal of attention to providing the proper facilities for guarding the buildings against fire and perfecting arrangements which will be a safeguard against the destruction of the multitude of expensive exhibits which will soon be placed in the buildings.</p>
                            <p>A system has been arranged which is believed to be extensive enough to meet all the requirements and assure as perfect protection as is possible to be obtained.</p>
                            <p>There is now stationed on the exposition grounds, in the hose house, standing temporarily on the south side of the lagoon about the middle of the tract, a four-wheel hose reel manned by five men.  These men were picked from the Omaha fire department and are all experienced fire fighters.  They are all single men and live on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Within a short time the house in which this company is sheltered will be moved from its present temporary location to Twentieth street, between Manderson and Pratt, where it will be about midway between the main court and the north tract.  Another hose house will be erected on the bluff tract opposite the viaduct leading from the main court onto the bluff tract.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">BUYING MORE EQUIPMENT.</head>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall has contracted for a hook and ladder truck of the largest size, carrying a sixty-foot ladder and several smaller ladders in addition to the other equipment of a truck.  He has also contracted for two hose wagons.  All of this apparatus is of the most improved type and has been selected with the advice of Chief Redell of the Omaha fire department, who was appointed by Manager Kirkendall some time ago as a member of the Fire Insurance board for the grounds.  It is the expectation of the exposition management that the city authorities will take this apparatus from the exposition at a fair price after the exposition is closed.</p>
                            <p>No definite arrangements have yet been made for manning the apparatus, but it is rather taken for granted that the Omaha fire department will supply the men.  The men now on duty on the grounds are being paid by the city, but whether the city will continue this policy has not been determined.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the fire apparatus referred to there is a complete system of stand pipes in each of the exposition buildings.  The Machinery and Electricity building is provided with four of these stand pipes, each having two openings.  The pipe extending from the water main to the building is six inches in diameter, but the stand pipe is but three inches in size.  Attached to each opening in the stand pipe will be from 100 to 150 feet of hose.  These stand pipes are so arranged that the entire interior of the building is within reach of the hose.  In the Machinery and Electricity building there are four stand pipes, each having two openings, the Mines buildings has six stand pipes, the Liberal Arts six, the Fine Arts four, Agriculture six, Manufactures six, Girls' and Boys' building two, Auditorium two.</p>
                            <p>Hydrants are placed at the ends and in front of each <choice><sic>buliding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice> in such a way as to afford an ample supply of water.  On the Midway hydrants are placed 200 feet apart.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the water service there will also be a large chemical engine of 100 gallons capacity stationed on the grounds and three-gallon portable chemical extinguishers will be distributed in profusion in all of the buildings.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Thomas Orchestra Secured for a Five Weeks' Engagement.</head>
                            <p>The working out of the details of the music for the exposition is progressing slowly, there being several differences of opinion between the musical director and some of the executive committee regarding certain of the details.  These matters are of such a nature, however, that the delay does not affect in any way the progress of the main features of the arrangement.</p>
                            <p>It has been definitely settled that the Theodore Thomas Chicago orchestra will be at the exposition during the first five weeks and perhaps longer, and will furnish the orchestral music for the various choral societies which will appear in the Auditorium during its engagement.  The Apollo club of Chicago, one of the best known musical organizations in the country, will probably appear two or three times at the opening of the exposition.  Arrangements are now pending by which this society will render "Elijah" the opening day of the exposition and will follow this on the two or three succeeding days with lighter works of well known composers.  Other choral societies of note are preparing to come to the exposition, among them being the Minneapolis society, the magnificent choir of the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City, the Denver society, the St. Louis society and many others.</p>
                            <p>Musical Director Kimball is negotiating with managers of a number of the most noted soloists for engagements to appear in the Auditorium both in solos and in company with some of the numerous choral societies.  It is his intention to have a concert in the Auditorium afternoon and evening at least three days each week.  These concerts will include all classes of music.  There will be orchestral numbers, solos by noted singers and oratorios by different choral societies.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha Exposition chorus will meet at Hayden's music hall at 8 o'clock tomorrow night, at which time the beautiful Easter hymn from Cavalleria Rusticana will be taken up and a portion of the time will probably be devoted to Stainer's "Daughter of Jairus."  This chorus is meeting with great encouragement from the singers of Omaha and a general invitation is extended to all singers to join this organization and help along the good cause.  There is room for singers in all branches of the chorus and as a money saving investment, the terms offered would be hard to beat.  An entrance fee of $5 is required of each member and in return for this, in addition to the instruction which will be received during rehearsals, each member will be furnished with a ticket admitting him to the Auditorium to all concerts given there.  As there will be at least 100 concerts, to which the admission will never be less than 25 cents, the chorus member will be ahead just $20 in money.  One of the rules provides that simplicity will prevail in the matter of dress; the women will wear a blue serge sack coat, with pants and straw hat.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BRINGING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exposition Buildings Are Rapidly Nearing Completion.</head>
                            <p>The grounds of the main court of the exposition grounds are in a torn-up condition and visitors find considerable difficulty in making their way about unless they are athletically inclined and are fond of jumping over ditches and other obstructions.  The work of laying storm water sewers to carry the water from the roofs of the main buildings into the lagoon is being pushed and a large force of men, divided into gangs, are crowding this work as fast as possible.  Another large force under the direction of Landscape Architect Ulrich is also digging up the ground and interfering with sightseeing by planting trees and making other preparations for the beautification of this part of the grounds.  Still another force of workmen is engaged in putting a heavy iron railing all around the banks of the lagoon and making approaches to the water's edge, preparing the island for the embellishment which is to be placed on it, and making various other preparations.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the work being done upon the ground, both above and below, numerous workmen are engaged in putting the finishing touches on the main buildings.  The scaffolding used by the staff workers on the Manufactures, Agriculture and Liberal Arts buildings is being removed and these three buildings now take their places among the almost completed palaces, in which class the Mines and Machinery buildings have been for some time.  The Art building is now in the hands of the staff workers and rapid progress is promised by Smith &amp; Eastman, the staff <choice><sic>contrators</sic><corr>contractors</corr></choice>.  They will put their entire force on this building and it will be completed within a very short time.</p>
                            <p>The government building continues to be the marvel of all beholders.  The speed with which this immense structure has taken form has been the cause of remarks by every person who visits the grounds or who passes in sight of the building.  George Moore &amp; Sons of Memphis have the carpenter contract and Alexander &amp; Son, also of Memphis, have the staff contract.  The construction of the building is under the direction of Engineer J. J. Farnan, one of the staff of the Treasury department.</p>
                            <p>Those who secure a view of the building from the inside of the grounds are loud in their praise of the great promise of beauty which is held out.  The carpenter work on the building is rapidly nearing completion, the dome being almost entirely finished and the staff work is making extraordinary progress.  The contractor was seriously delayed by failure to receive the models from Washington until very recently, but no time has been lost since these arrived and the finishing staff is being turned out very rapidly.  The ornamentation of this building is extremely ornate and beautiful.  Enough of the staff is now on the building to convey a very fair idea of the appearance of the finished structure and the classic beauty of the building is apparent in every line.  The decoration is on a broad and heavy scale, giving the building a massive appearance and the nicety with which the details are worked out shows that no little point has been neglected.  The staff which is going on the building is of exceptional whiteness and the casting is clear cut, having every appearance of the finest marble.  The entire exterior is to be covered with staff and this will add greatly to the appearance, as the staff is much whiter and smoother than the plaster coating which covers the plain surface of the other buildings.</p>
                            <p>It is expected that all of the underground work in the main court will be completed within a week and work will then be commenced upon the walks in this part of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Work on the roadways on the bluff tract will be commenced early this week.  The contract for these walks was let to Van Court &amp; Winn some time ago and they have only been waiting for the frost to leave the ground before beginning work.  In the exposed position of the bluff tract the ground is nearly free from frost and work will be commenced at once.  These walks will be macadamized.  No decision has yet been reached regarding the material to be used for the walks in the main court.  Brick is strongly favored in some quarters, mainly because of its cheapness and on account of the large amount of salvage.</p>
                            <p>Graders have been started to work on the site of the Transportation building and the driving of the piles for this building will be commenced within a few days.  The lumber for the building has been ordered and is <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The Danish association of this city celebrated its twenty-seventh anniversary last night in Washington hall.  The affair was in main a masquerade ball, but during the course of the evening an interesting pantomime was rendered.  The attendance was good and the number of costumes that appeared on the floor was unusually large.  In honor of the day the hall was <choice><sic>hansomely</sic><corr>handsomely</corr></choice> decorated with the American and Danish colors.  Stringers of bunting hung from all the balconies.  The effect was heightened by a number of Chinese lanterns which were placed behind the folds of the decorations.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Government Officer Expresses His Delight with the Arrangement of the Grounds and Buildings and Plans of the Work.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>"The management of the Transmississippi Exposition has displayed more common sense in the arrangement of the ground at its disposal and more intelligence in the disposition of the available facilities than has been the case with any former exposition.  The result it, that more has been accomplished for the money expended and a better effect produced upon visitors than has been possible with other expositions."</p>
                            <p>This is what Dr. David T. Day, one of the officers of the United States Geological survey, said to Major T. S. Clarkson, assistant to the president, in whose company he had just visited the several tracts constituting the exposition grounds.  Dr. Day has been connected in an official capacity with every exposition of recent years in which the government exhibits and his last visit was made with a picture in his mind's eye of the grounds as they appeared in the early stages.</p>
                            <p>"I do not mean to disparage the management of any other exposition," continued Dr. Day, "but the people at the head of this exposition have simply profited by the experience of their predecessors.  The result is that they have produced the most magnificent result and have a setting which has never been excelled.  I realized when I was here before that the possibilities were very great and I have been somewhat curious to learn just how things were being worked out, but I am delighted with the broad and liberal plan with which the whole matter has been treated and I predict that this will be one of the grandest and most complete expositions ever held in this country.  The opportunities were magnificent and they have been taken advantage of to the fullest extent.</p>

                            <p>"I have been looking at the Government building," continued Dr. Day, "and am glad to see the way it is progressing.  The government has never been late at any exposition and will not be in this case.  It is safe to say that every government exhibit will be in place and the doors ready to open the morning of May 31.  Much of the material to be sent here is boxed now and ready for shipping and it will be sent forward just as soon as the space is ready for it.</p>
                            <p>"The exhibits to be made by the several departments will be much more extensive than the exhibit made at either Nashville or Atlanta.  All of the material at Nashville was sent back to Washington, and the material to be sent to Omaha will be an entirely new exhibit.  Of course, there may be some things sent here that were at Nashville, and the same cases will probably be used in a great many instances, but the exhibit will be fresh and in the best of shape.  There will not be as much material as was exhibited at Chicago, principally because there will not be as much space, but it developed that much of the material shown at Chicago was simply 'dead timber' and this will be eliminated, with the result that the character of the exhibit will be even better than that at the World's fair."</p>
                            <p>Dr. Day is in Omaha in response to a telegram from Manager Bruce of the Exhibits department who wished to consult <unclear reason="torn"/>missioner of the mining exhibit.  This is a position which has never been filled and it has been tendered to Dr. Day.  The doctor is an expert in mining, his work with the geological survey being of a nature that brings all matters in the department work connected with mining under his direction.  He was in charge of the mineral exhibit at the Nashville and Atlanta expositions and has had wide experiences in such matters.  In event that he accepts the position offered him by Manager Bruce, he will act in an official capacity as a government officer and also as an officer of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SOME OF HIS IDEAS.</head>
                            <p>When in Omaha last fall Dr. Day offered a number of suggestions regarding the general rules which should govern a mining exhibit, and if he becomes an officer of the exposition he will probably carry out the plan then suggested.  At that time he declared that the most effective way of making a mining exhibit that would be instructive, as well as pleasing, would be to show the various stages of mining operations, working out the details of each kind of mining, showing the different conditions in which each metal is found, the processes of treating the ores, and, in fact, making the exhibit a perfect school of instruction which shall show everything there is to be known regarding this great industry.</p>
                            <p>The time which will intervene before the gates will open will be very short in which to carry out such a plan and make a complete exhibit, but in speaking of this matter, Dr. Day said a great deal could be done in three months with energetic work.</p>

                            <p>Six camels and eight diminutive donkeys, followed by about 200 small boys, formed a motley procession which wended its way slowly along Sherman avenue Sunday afternoon toward the exposition grounds and impressed people along the street with the idea that a circus was coming to town.  It was simply the advance guard of one of the concessions which will occupy a prominent place on the Midway of the exposition, the concession <choice><sic>wach</sic><corr>which</corr></choice> was first called Cosmopolis, but which will <choice><sic>probbaly</sic><corr>probably</corr></choice> be called Streets of Nations.</p>
                            <p>The proprietor of this concession is Gaston Akoun, a Frenchman, who furnished some of the amusement at the World's fair, at Atlanta and at Nashville.  He arrived in the city Sunday with his camels and donkeys and a company of about twenty people, who will take part in the entertainment to be furnished in this concession.  A further consignment of animals will all have their uses in connection with the ceremonies which will form features in this attraction.  The elephants, camels and donkeys will be used to carry people about the streets, while the yak will form the center of attraction as the sacred bull in the religious ceremonies in that section of the concession devoted to India.</p>
                            <p>The Streets of Nations will illustrate the life and customs of the people in a number of Old World cities.  Mr. Akoun says that a strong feature will be a revival of Olympian games and to give a fitting setting for these a building will be erected in the center of the ground which will be a reproduction of the famous Parthenon.  In the open space about this the games will take place and from this plaza will radiate the streets set apart for the different nations.  Each of these will have houses, bazaars, cafes, etc., representing the actual conditions in the country depicted and will be peopled by natives of those countries.  These will carry on their several duties and will manufacture articles peculiar to their country, which will be sold as souvenirs.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The demand for statuary to add the finishing touch to the beautiful palaces on the exposition grounds is responsible for the establishment in Omaha of a new industry, giving employment to a number of men.</p>
                            <p>Every building on the main court will be decorated with statuary, both single figures and groups, and the turning out of the completed figures involves a great amount of work, of which the general public knows little or nothing.  To do this work sculptors of ability have come to Omaha and are now engaged in modeling the silent presentments of life, actual and symbolical.  Workshops have been established in various parts of the city, where each sculptor has a force of assistants.</p>
                            <p>Sculptor Franz Engelsmann of Chicago has the contract for the statuary for the Agriculture building, and his shop is a very busy place.  There are a large number of single figures and groups in the statuary designed for this building and one large pair of spandrels which are to be placed over the main entrance.  Sculptor Metler of Chicago has the contract for the statuary on the Administration building, and has his work almost completed.  R. W. Bock, another Chicago sculptor, is making the statuary for the Machinery and Electricity building, and Sculptor Bringhurst of St. Louis is now working on the lavish decoration for the Art building.</p>

                            <p>In preparing this statuary the first thing is a suggestion from the architect of the general character of the decoration to be employed.  This is furnished in the form of a sketch or wash drawing.  It is more or less definite, according to the ideas of the <choice><sic>archiect</sic><corr>architect</corr></choice>.  Taking this as a guide, the sculptor moulds in clay what he, too, calls a sketch.  These small models or sketches are usually about a foot or less in height and are not made to any definite scale.  They are simply the expression of the ideas of the architect elaborated and given definite form by the sculptor.  The sketch is submitted to the architect for approval, and when this is received the work on the statue proper is commenced.  With the sketch as a model a full-size figure is modeled in clay.  A skeleton of sticks is made in crude form, the only purpose being to give rigidity to the figure.  A single piece of wood two inches square and of the proper height furnishes the "backbone" for a heroic statue of man or woman, and a cross piece of wood or iron at the shoulders furnishes a foundation for the arms, if they be extended.  On this framework the clay is moulded roughly, and gradually worked to the proper form.  In every case the figure is moulded in the nude in order to give the proper contour, and the drapery is moulded in clay after the figure has been approved.  This work requires great skill and care.  As the figure nears completion the clay is scraped away or small pieces pressed on wherever necessary until the proper result is attained.  When completed it is approved by the reviewing authority and alterations may then be made wherever necessary.</p>
                            <p>After approval the clay figure is given a liberal coating of shellac.  When this is dried the figure is divided into sections by pressing strips of tin into the clay, and a mould, in plaster, is taken of each of these sections.  A mould is also made of each section in a preparation composed largely of glue.  The glue mould is placed inside the plaster mould, which holds the glue in the proper position.  From these sectional moulds the plaster figure is made, the process being much the same as that for making staff.  The interior of the glue mould is coated with a mixture of hard plaster which "sets" very quickly, and this is strengthened with plaster mixed with hemp or jute fiber, the whole cast being about an inch in thickness.  In this way the entire figure is cast and the parts are then assembled, the joints "pointed up" and the figure is complete.  The surface is gone over very carefully and dressed, all little <choice><sic>excresences</sic><corr>excrescences</corr></choice> being removed and imperfect spots filled with plaster.  This process is the same with all the figures and requires a great deal of time.</p>

                            <p>Governor Bushnell of Ohio writes the Department of Publicity and Promotion of the exposition that he is doing all he can to further the interests of the exposition in Ohio.  There is now pending in the legislature a resolution providing for the participation of the Buckeye state with those of the western country in the great fair.  As soon as the action on this matter has been taken, which will not long be postponed, Governor Bushnell will name a state commission and the work will be promptly pushed.  Public interest in the exposition has been greatly stimulated recently and there is good prospect of extensive represented from Ohio.</p>
                            <p>Governor Bradley of Kentucky says in a letter to the Department of Publicity and Promotion that there is good reason for thinking that the legislature of his state will adopt, at his suggestion, a bill which appropriates $10,000 for making an exhibit at Omaha.  The commercial interests of the state have taken a deep interest in the matter since it was properly brought to their attention and want to make a showing that will attract for Kentucky some attention among the western as well as the southern states of the nation.  Recently the Louisville Chamber of Commerce adopted an address to the dealers of the state, setting out the benefits that would grow from the state's being properly represented at the exposition.  Much pressure is being brought on the legislature through the business men of the state in behalf of the appropriation.</p>

                            <p>Captain Ward, U. S. A., who has charge of the War department's exhibit on behalf of the government, has returned to Washington to take part in a conference of the Board of Control, which will be held at Washington during the week.  This meeting will very likely result in the immediate shipment to Omaha of a large part of the government's exhibit.  It was at first intended to send the articles direct from Nashville to Omaha.  Investigation, however, at the close of the Nashville show proved that much of the exhibit made there was not what was wanted for Omaha.  The scope of the Transmississippi Exposition is greater than the Board of Control had at first anticipated and the change in plans growing out of the increase in the size of the building and the rearrangement of the apportionment made necessary a revision of plans for the exhibit.  The Board of Control now expects to make a much more extensive and comprehensive exhibit of the government's functions than was shown at Nashville.  Some days ago Supervising Engineer Farnan received word from Washington requesting him to push the work of construction, as the board wanted to begin to ship exhibits to this city without delay.  Farnan replied that shipments could begin at once, for by the time any freight could arrive the building would be in condition to afford excellent storage.  Since then great progress has been made on the building and it is now in condition to provide storage for the entire exhibit, and within a little while the erection of exhibits in place will be possible.</p>

A great amount of argument was required to convince the new president of the Union Pacific that his road should subscribe a liberal amount.  He admitted from the first that something should be done, but was not disposed to make the amount as large as some of the committee thought should be given.  He finally reached the sum of $25,000 and this was deemed acceptable by the committee.</p>
                            <p>The only roads now remaining in the background in the matter of contributing to the exposition treasury are the Missouri Pacific "when the revenue of the road will warrant it," but that point seems not to have been reached.  Some intimation has been expected from him for a long time, but nothing has been heard that would indicate that the prospect is any brighter now than when the exposition movement was first started and this pledge was given.  The road is expected to subscribe at least $10,000.  Whether this Wabash road will contribute anything to the exposition is still an open question.  When the estimate was first made of the amount each road should be asked to subscribe, the Wabash was scheduled for $5,000, but since that time the deal with the Kansas City, Pittsburg &amp; Gulf road has complicated matters somewhat in this connection and some readjustment will probably be made.</p>

                            <head type="sub">IOWA'S PARTICIPATION IS CERTAIN.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Legislature Ready to Make the Necessary Appropriation.</head>
                            <p>Special Agent C. E. Llewellyn of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, has just returned from Des Moines, where he went at the direction of Manager Rosewater to survey the ground and report on the probability of an appropriation for state participation in the exposition.  Mr. Llewellyn states that he is convinced that the Iowa legislature will appropriate at least $25,000 in addition to the $10,000 appropriated by the preceding legislature.</p>
                            <p>"There is no particular opposition to an appropriation for the Iowa Exposition commission," said Mr. Llewellyn, "but nearly all of the people admit the something should be done.  The state indebtedness is about $600,000, while the constitutional limit is $250,000.  All appropriations for state institutions are being reduced to the lowest limit and the sentiment is in favor of treating the exposition appropriation in the same way.  The state commission has asked for $47,400 and the commission says if it cannot get that much it doesn't want any.  This rather arbitrary position has caused some little friction, but the matter will probably be adjusted without trouble.  I was satisfied when I left Des Moines that the house committee would recommend an appropriation of $30,000 and I see that was done yesterday.  I am just as well satisfied that the senate committee will reduce this amount to $25,000, and I believe that is what will be appropriated.  I talked with a number of members of the legislature and told them that if anything was to be done it should be done at once, as the space which has been held in reserve for Iowa is in great demand, and they must not expect the exposition to keep it for them and then be left holding the sack.  The state commission has been pounding the legislature to take some action in the matter and I believe there will be no further delay."</p>
                            <p>The delay on the part of Iowa has caused the Department of Exhibits great uneasiness for some time.  When the Iowa commissioners were in Omaha soon after their appointment they picked out one of the choicest building sites on the bluff tract and the choicest locations in the main buildings, requesting that these be reserved for Iowa.  Merely as a matter of accommodation this was done and no further steps have been taken by the Iowa commission to clinch the reservation.  Other states have been clamoring for the site selected for Iowa's building and have insisted that they were ready to take the site and pay for it.  Missouri and Arkansas each demanded that they be given this site because Iowa had given no sign that it would erect a building or make an exhibit and they were very wroth when they were refused.  Relying upon the partial promise of the Iowa commissioners the spaces in the buildings and on the grounds have been held, but a formal notice was recently sent to the Iowa commissioners that this sort of thing could not be continued indefinitely and decisive action must be taken at once or the spaces would be assigned to other parties.</p>

                            <p>Dion Geraldine, who "resigned" last fall his position as superintendent of the work of construction on the exposition buildings, had been in Kansas City recently.  His mission there was to purchase a second-hand "shoot the chutes" outfit, which will be installed somewhere on the grounds during the exposition period.  In conversing with reporters at Kansas City Mr. Geraldine admitted that "the Omaha exposition from an architectural standpoint will be one of the greatest exhibits ever given in the United States."  According to the paper from which this is taken, "Mr. Geraldine was the superintendent of the World's fair at Chicago and is the executive officer of the Omaha exposition."</p>
                            <p>The "shoot the chutes" outfit purchased by Mr. Geraldine has hitherto been used at Troost park, Kansas City.  It was shipped to Omaha Monday night.</p>

                            <p>The musical director of the exposition is the recipient of many calls from representatives of great musicians who desire to enter into engagements for their principals to appear at the exposition.  Prominent among these is A. Liberati, cornet soloist, who desires to make an engagement for himself and his entire band of fifty skilled musicians.  The representative of Sousa, the bandmaster who appeals to the common people, is also here endeavoring to close a contract for the organization which is swayed by Sousa's magic baton.  Ysaye, the great violinist, and Gerardi, the 'cellist, who are touring together, have a representative on the ground, and the numerous singers of renown have representatives on the ground endeavoring to make arrangements for the appearance of their principals.  No engagements have yet been made with any of these people, but definite plans will probably be perfected in the near future.</p>

                            <p>The Minnesota Exposition commission is new organized and ready for business.  The members met at the office of Governor Clough in Minneapolis last week and discussed the situation thoroughly.  The governor urged the members to take prompt steps to have the state represented, notwithstanding the failure of the legislature to make an appropriation.  It was suggested that subscribers might be reimbursed by the legislature, as was done in the case of the World's fair exhibit.  The consensus of opinion was that at least $25,000 would be required for an exhibit and at least $5,000 for a building, if the commission decided to erect a state building.  The latter point was left undecided, although plans were submitted by MacLeod &amp; Lamoreaux of Minneapolis for a building to be constructed entirely of logs.</p>
                            <p>The commission was organized by the election of the following officers and committees:</p>

                            <p>President, John L. Gibbs, Geneva; vice president, R. A. Kirk, St. Paul; secretary, E. L. Danforth, Minneapolis; treasurer, W. D. Kirk, St. Paul.</p>
                            <p>Executive committee, the above officers and C. H. Graves, Duluth; A. T. Stebbins, Rochester; E. J. Phelps, Minneapolis.</p>
                            <p>Press committee, J. M. Anderson, Minneapolis; Conde Hamlin, St. Paul; Elmer Adams, Fergus Falls; Hudson Wilson, Faribault; A. D. Thompson, Duluth.</p>
                            <p>The following gentlemen were appointed to look after the arrangements and selection of the principal exhibits that will comprise the state's exhibits:  Manufactures, E. L. Danforth, Minneapolis; grain and milling, E. J. Phelps, Minneapolis; dairy and stock, John L. Gibbs, Geneva; agriculture, E. W. Randall, St. Anthony Park; lumber and building, J. Newton Nind, Minneapolis; mines and mining interests, J. L. Greatsinger, Duluth.</p>
                            <p>The second meeting of the commission will be held Thursday of this week, when a plan for raising funds will be adopted.  The plan that met with the greatest favor at the first meeting was for the counties to contribute according to some agreed basis, the amount to be returned by the legislature at its next session.</p>

                            <p>Manager Bruce of the Exhibits department reported to the executive committee yesterday afternoon that he had reached an understanding with Dr. David T. Day regarding the position of superintendent of the Mining building and exhibits, and he recommended that Dr. Day be appointed to that position.  The appointment was approved at once and Dr. Day will enter immediately upon his duties.  He will make a careful survey of the situation and will devote the balance of this week to formulating a plan of operations.  With the exception of a few days, he will devote all of his time until the month of July in carrying out such plans for the mining exhibits as may be decided on.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee decided that the building which is to be constructed as an overflow for the Manufactures building shall be called the International building.  It will be occupied by the foreign exhibitors.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall was authorized to grant the Illinois commission additional space for the Art annex which will be erected near the Illinois building.  In this building will be exhibited a number of valuable works of art, among them four large paintings of the World's fair which have seen on exhibition in Chicago for some time.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall was also authorized to grant space to a number of citizens of Canton, O., who desire to erect on the grounds a fac simile of the McKinley cottage in Canton, which was the Mecca of so many citizens of the United States during the last presidential campaign.  The house will be filled with a large number of exhibits of campaign mementoes.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles was authorized to arrange plans for the celebration in connection with the opening of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Land of Wheat Contributes to the Composite Photograph.</head>
                            <p>North Dakota's contributions to the composite picture which is to show the condensed essence of the beauty of the women of the transmississippi region, has been received by Manager Lindsey.  The two women chosen by Vice President Lounsberry of Fargo are Mrs. Fred B. Fancher of Bismarck and Mrs. E. M. Darrow of Fargo.  Their photographs meet the requirements of the competition and have been forwarded by Manager Lindsey to New <choice><sic>oYrk</sic><corr>York</corr></choice>, where Photographer Rockwood, the inventor of the composite photograph, will include them in the picture which is to form the model for the woman's head which will appear on one side of the exposition medal.</p>
                            <p>In addition to these pictures, Vice President Lounsberry sent to Manager Lindsey the photographs of the women not chosen who had consented to having their pictures appear in Munseys Magazine as types of western beauty.  The Department of Publicity and Promotion has already received a large number of pictures which had been thrown out by the several vice presidents, and these will all be turned over to the publishers of Munsey's Magazine for publication.  The conditions surrounding this contest was so short, that comparatively few eligible women could comply with them.  The pictures were required to show a full profile of head and shoulders, showing the left side of the face, and evening dress was absolutely necessary.  As a photograph complying with these specifications is a decided rarity, and as expert photographers do not exist on every corner in most western towns, it was a very difficult matter to secure photographs coming within the requirements.  A large number were sent to the vice presidents, however, with the idea, perhaps, that they "might do," and as a result the vice <choice><sic>presiednts</sic><corr>presidents</corr></choice> have in their possession a large number of photographs of very handsome women.  Acting under the request of the Publicity department the vice presidents have endeavored to secure the consent of the subjects of these pictures to have them appear in Munsey's and the department is receiving a number of them.</p>
                            <p>The contribution of North Dakota consists of thirteen pictures, all of them being portraits of women of exceptional beauty, but they do not comply entirely with the provisions of the management and could not be used in making a composite picture.</p>

                            <p>The third rehearsal of the Exposition chorus was held at Hayden's music hall last night.  The membership was still further increased by the addition of a number of well known singers and Choral Director Kelly announced that he would accept no more soprano voices, as there were as many sopranos enrolled as were necessary.</p>
                            <p>He said a few more members would be accepted in the other branches and the lists would then be closed.</p>
                            <p>The meetings of the chorus will hereafter be held on Tuesday nights in the large room at the southwest corner of the top floor of the city hall.  The use of this room was granted the chorus last night by the Board of Education and the rehearsals will be held there Tuesday night of each week until further notice.</p>
                            <p>The entire evening was spend in drilling the various parts on the beautiful Easter hymn from "Cavalleria Rusticana."  There were about 150 voices in the chorus.  Good progress was made on this rather difficult selection, and the result was encouraging to the conductor.</p>
                            <p>Cards were issued to all members of the chorus whose voices had been tested and they were instructed to pay their fee of $5 to Secretary Wakefield at Exposition headquarters.</p>

They estimate that about $16,000 will be raised if this plan is carried out.  The plan of the commission provides that this sum shall be used for making a display of the resources of the counties east of the Missouri, the Black Hills counties having already made provision for an exhibit of their own.  It is also the intention of the commission to have a local organization in each county seat and raise a fund of $100 in each place to be offered to the farmers for the best collections of grain and other products, in order to collect a fine lot of material for exhibits.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The election of an assistant secretary of the Nebraska Exposition commission to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of W. H. Dearing after his appointment as assistant physician at the Hospital for the Insane at Norfolk, developed one of the neatest little skirmishes on the outskirts of the approaching state campaign that has been seen in these parts for some time.  J. N. Campbell of Fullerton, a populist, was elected to succeed Dearing, and there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in the ranks of the popocrats over the outcome of the scrimmage.  The most active candidates for the position to be filled were J. N. Campbell, J. G. P. Hildebrand of Lancaster county and B. S. Littlefield of Otoe county.  Campbell and Littlefield are populists and Hildebrand is a democrat.  The latter's application was endorsed by the entire democratic machine of the state, including the officers of the state committee, Nebraska members of the national committee, and numerous other prominent in the councils of the party in this state.</p>
                            <p>As soon as it became known that W. H. Dearing had been appointed assistant secretary of the Norfolk Asylum for the Insane applications began to pour into the office of the commission, and there were at least a dozen candidates of different degrees of efficiency.  Certain of the members of the commission, however, saw the opportunity to kill several birds with one stone and a nice little job was fixed up which worked like a charm.</p>
                            <p>The parties to this scheme were Judge Neville, <choice><sic>chariman</sic><corr>chairman</corr></choice> of the commission, Commissioner Poynter and Secretary of State Porter.</p>
                            <p><choice><sic>Julge</sic><corr>Judge</corr></choice> Neville has been conceded to be a candidate for the gubernatorial nomination at the hands of the populists.  His friends argue that he is entitled to it because he was elected a contingent judge of the supreme court but was not allowed to take his seat because the constitutional amendment increasing the number of members of the court was not adopted.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AND POYNTER, TOO.</head>
                            <p>Commissioner Poynter is anxious to secure the nomination for congress from the Third district to succeed Judge Maxwell, the word having been passed around among the populists that Maxwell is not to be nominated.  One stumbling block in Poynter's way was said to be in the fact that J. N. Campbell, a member of the upper house of the last legislature, is also an active candidate for congressional honors.  In addition to his congressional aspirations Campbell is credited with having considerable of a pull in his own district and in other sections of the state as well, and to be a rather formidable antagonist.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Poynter is known to be anxious to sacrifice his private interests in order to serve his country another term, and these three formed a combination to secure Campbell's influence and get him out of Poynter's way by making him assistant secretary.</p>
                            <p>Governor Holcomb also took a hand in the matter, but there appears to be considerable uncertainty as to just what the governor wanted in this connection.  Judge Neville said the governor had asked that the commission do nothing in the matter of electing a successor to Dearing until he could consult with the members of the commission.  The governor was in the city last night, but did not appear about the Millard hotel, where the meeting of the commission was held, and he authorized a denial of the statement that he had asked the commission to delay action.  Secretary Porter was said to be armed with a letter from the governor, however, to the effect that he endorsed Campbell and he showed this letter to members of the commission after the meeting had adjourned.</p>

                            <p>The fact that a successor to Dearing would be selected at this meeting of the commission and that the "committee on pie," appointed at the last meeting to distribute the offices among the members of the commission, would report, accounted for the presence in the lobby last night of a number of popocrats who have been hoping some crumbs of comfort in the shape of jobs would fall to their share.  Some of the lucky ones who have been holding office since the last election were also there to assist the commissioners in finding men to fill the available positions.  Among the latter were Frank Hibbard, state oil inspector; W. C. Bullard, Omaha police commissioner; J. H. Dawes, superintendent of the Institute for the Deaf, and D. Clem Deaver, steward at the same institution.</p>
                            <p>The commission remained in session until 10 o'clock, considering various matters of business, and adjourned without <unclear reason="torn"/> the desires of the anxious on<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>After adjournment the members of the commission remained about the office until midnight, each member being buttonholed by a supporter of one of the candidates or by the candidates themselves.  Campbell, Littlefield and Hildebrand were there and Secretary of State Porter took an active interest in the vigorous "log rolling" which was in progress.</p>

                            <p>The commission convened again at 9 o'clock this morning and about the first matter taken up was the acceptance of Dearing's resignation and the election of his successor.  An informal written ballot was first taken, resulting like this:  F. E. Diefendorf of Butler county, 1; J. N. Campbell, 2; B. S. Littlefield, 1; J. G. P. Hildebrand, 2.  Diefendorf was Caspers man and <choice><sic>hiswas</sic><corr>his was</corr></choice> the one vote cast for him.  Neville and Poynter voted for Campbell, Dutton voted for Littlefield and Boydston and Whitford voted for Hildebrand.  The second ballot resulted:  Diefendorf, 1; Campbell, 3; Littlefield, 1; Hildebrand, 1.  A third ballot was ordered and this gave Campbell a majority, the vote being like this:  Campbell, 4; Littlefield, 2.  Whitford and Boydston voted for Littlefield and the other members voted for Campbell.</p>
                            <p>This removed a large element of interest from the proceedings of the commission and when the "pie committee" announced that it had not come to any conclusion on the allotment of the spoils and would not make any reports until the next meeting the lobby quickly vanished and the members were left alone in their glory.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the interest created in the proceedings of the commission by the knowledge that there would be a more or less generous distribution of spoils and chances for jobs the meeting of the board was made more interesting by the fact that all superintendents of departments were ordered to submit reports showing the expense of their departments, both up to date and in prospect.  In accordance with these instructions the superintendents were at the meeting in force and their reports were sandwiched in between the other proceedings of the commission.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent E. D. Johnson of the Agricultural department reported that $8,247.69 would cover the entire cost of his department.  He made a number of recommendations to the board which were adopted.  These provide that all counties wishing space in the Nebraska agricultural exhibit must file applications with Superintendent Johnson on or before April 1, and must commence work installing their exhibits on or before May 1.  Assistant Superintendent C. E. Drake was ordered to commence work in this department April 1, and Secretary Johnson was directed to commence preparing at once for the exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent W. R. Jackson of the Educational department showed that there had been expended for his department to date. $5,809.40 and the estimate of the amount still required to make the exhibit and care for it</p>

                            <p>C. H. Elmendorf, Thurlington; W. G. Whitmore, Valley; C. H. Searl, Edgar, and W. H. Chappel, Normal, constituted a committee representing the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders' association and the Nebraska Swine Breeders' association.  They asked sufficient money to exhibit improved stock at the exposition in competition with the fancy stock from other states.  Mr. Elmendorf as spokesman urged the large extent of the fine stock industry in this state as good and sufficient reason why the commission should assist the breeders.  The matter was, however, laid over.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Dawes of the Institute for the Deaf asked for an allowance of $100 for buying material for making show cases in which to place the exhibit of the institution, the cases to be made by the boys in the manual training department.  This was allowed.</p>
                            <p>Miss Mellona Butterfield, superintendent of the Art department, made a verbal <choice><sic>repart</sic><corr>report</corr></choice> regarding the decoration of the Nebraska building, including the tinting of the walls, carpeting the floors of the rooms, etc., her estimate of the probable expense being $3,900.  As the committee to determine the uses to which the rooms are to be devoted had not reported, Miss Butterfield said she could not make an exact report and the matter was laid over until after this committee shall have reported.</p>
                            <p>At this point the board decided to go into executive session and the room was cleared of everybody except members of the commission.</p>
                            <p>In executive session the report of the superintendent of live stock was received and filed for future reference.  It was decided to lay off all the carpenters, including the superintendent of construction, and Mr. Whitford was appointed a committee of one to supervise the completion of the Nebraska building.  In view of the fact that a carpenter will be needed for the construction of wall space in the building, repairs, etc., the commission decided to unite this position with that of timekeeper at the timekeeper's salary.  Bookkeeper Althen's salary was raised from $65 to $75.</p>

                            <p>Alexander &amp; Son, the staff contractors for the Horticulture building, have constructed a shop inside of the building and have a staff of men at work making the models and patterns for the staff for this building.  This building is well advanced and the woodwork is practically completed to the cornice line, a large force of carpenters being engaged on the dome, which will be finished within a very short time.  The staff work will be pushed and the contractors expect to complete the entire building within thirty days.</p>
                            <p>The same firm also has the staff contract for the two big restaurant buildings which will flank the east end of the main viaduct.  The have made preparations to commence at once the erection of a temporary shop under the viaduct and will commence turning out the staff for these buildings.  The carpenter contract on the restaurants has his piles on the grounds and will commence work at once.  The staff men will follow the carpenters closely and the buildings will be completed in a very short time.</p>
                            <p>A large force of workmen is engaged on the construction of the huge grotto in the northwest corner of the Government building, in which will be displayed the elaborate exhibit to be made by the fish commission.  The grotto will be finished in imitation of a tunnel through great rocks and will be lighted by incandescent lamps.  The entrance will be very elaborate, being of staff imitating intricate figures carved out of the rocks.</p>
                            <p>Engineer Farnan says that arrangements have been made to construct a tramway from the north door of the Government building to the railway tracks on the north side of the grounds.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee passed upon a matter at its meeting yesterday afternoon which will interest the hundreds of amateur photographers in Omaha and vicinity who have been visiting the exposition grounds and taking pictures of everything in sight.  The committee authorized Manager Reed to make a contract with F. A. Reinhart, an Omaha photographer, for the exclusive privilege of taking pictures on the exposition grounds with anything but a kodak.  This will be sad news to the many amateurs who have been amusing themselves and entertaining their friends with views of the grounds showing the progress made on the buildings and taking snap shots at interesting groups and incidents.  All this will be prevented in the future and nothing will be allowed but kodaks.  For this exclusive privilege Mr. Reinhart will pay to the exposition $1,000 and 20 per cent of the gross receipts.</p>
                            <p>The gondola concession was awarded to U. G. Graham for 20 per cent of the gross receipts.  Graham is associated with W. S. Jardine.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall reported that he had been offered reels for hose to be used inside the buildings in connection with the stand-pipes if he would pay the transportation expense from Independence, Mo.  The offer was accepted.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater was authorized to purchase 5,000 frames for the bird's-eye views of the grounds.  He was also authorized to make a contract for 200,000 copies of The Weekly Bee of the first week in May for $3,200, the paper ton contain a four-page supplement of exposition matter and a full-page bird's-eye view of the grounds this price to include mailing and postage.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Prof. Owens Reports on the Work of His Department.</head>
                            <p>Prof. R. B. Owens, superintendent of the Machinery and Electricity building and commissioner in charge of electrical exhibits, has notified the Department of Exhibits that the General Electric company wants 500 feet of space in addition to the 1,000 feet already reserved for this company and also offers to make an educational exhibit if allowed 300 feet of space in addition.  Prof. Owens writes that he has assigned Elihu Thompson 200 feet, Charles F. Brush 300 feet and Charles P. Stemmetz 200 feet, all for electrical exhibits of a high order of interest.  The American Vehicle company wishes space in the building for an exhibit of batteries, and B. J. Arnold, a consulting electrical engineer, wishes to exhibit drawings, etc.  Prof. Owens also names a number of prominent electrical firms which wish to exhibit electrical devices of various kinds, including electrical vehicles of several designs.  He also says that S. F. B. Morse, grandson of the inventor of the telegraph, has consented to exhibit the manuscript, apparatus, etc., belonging to his celebrated grandfather.</p>
                            <p>The professor announces that the Western Society of Engineers will meet in Omaha in September, also the Association of Edison companies.</p>

                            <p>Major Clarkson, assistant to the president, is strongly in favor of reviving the Omaha Press club and establishing a press headquarters where representatives of the newspapers of the country may feel at home and meet their colleagues.  He declares that something of this kind is an absolute necessity in view of the large number of newspaper representatives who will be in Omaha during the exposition and he is contemplating steps to bring about the desired result.</p>

                            <p>The business men of the Twin Cities&#8212;Minneapolis and St. Paul&#8212;are showing great interest in exposition affairs.</p>
                            <p>The Georgia Exposition commission has filed a formal application for 3,000 square feet of ground space on which to erect a state building.</p>
                            <p>T. Mizutany of Chicago, representing the Japanese Central Tea association, is in the city negotiating with the exposition authorities for a concession for a Japanese tea garden and a Japanese exhibit.</p>
                            <p>A generous attendance of Minnesota visitors is now assured.  The press and people of the state are rapidly awakening to the importance and magnitude of the approaching great exposition.</p>
                            <p>The proposed Minnesota building will show a structure with peaks and gables, wide verandas, built of logs, lumber, cut and rough stone, rubble work of stone and iron ore, brick and other products of the state.</p>
                            <p>The Estey Organ company applied by telegraph for 1,630 square feet of space for an exhibit of pianos and <choice><sic>orgains</sic><corr>organs</corr></choice>.  The application was accepted in the same expeditious manner <choice><sic>eand</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> a fine exhibit is in prospect by this firm.</p>
                            <p>Hon. John L. Gibbs, president of the Minnesota commission, is one of the good old war horses of the state, in whose hands work and imposed duties never lag.  The secretary of the commission, E. L. Danforth, is an active and capable young man, who will make a record in the field before him.</p>
                            <p>The secretary of the Minnesota commission reports many applications and inquiries for space and concessions.  As the North Star state is a community and rich in natural resources and peopled by an enterprising populace, much may be expected from that section.</p>
                            <p>The prospect for a New York state building seems to be very encouraging.  There is a balance of about $5,000 in the appropriation made by the legislature for state participation in the Nashville exposition, and Special Commissioner Wheeler is commencing operations to make this money available for the erection of a building.</p>
                            <p>The Self-Lifting Elevator company of Lima, O., has applied for space for installing one of its machines.  Superintendent Hardt is considering the advisability of having two or three of these machines installed in each of the main buildings for the use of people who do not wish to walk up and down the steps leading to the <choice><sic>gallaries</sic><corr>galleries</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>"Pigs-in-Clover" has been revived in behalf of the exposition.  In its new form the game has sixteen different colored balls.  The object is to separate the balls, getting eight of two colors on each side of the lagoon across the central bridge, and then putting four of each color in the proper compartments in the corners.  It is neatly gotten up and will serve to distract the attention of any one who tackles it.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>"May 25 the gates of the exposition will be closed against the reception of exhibits and any exhibitor not having his material on the grounds at that time will be shut out.  The time between that date and June 1 will be utilized in making ready for the opening of the gates and the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be opened on time and every exhibit will be in readiness for the inspection of visitors."  Thus spoke H. B. Hardt, superintendent of the Exhibits department of the exposition, and he showed a pile of printed notices to this effect which are being sent to all exhibitors as an incentive for them to govern themselves accordingly.</p>
                            <p>"It may work a hardship on some exhibitors to be compelled to comply with this rule," continued Mr. Hardt, "but it cannot be avoided if the exposition is to be opened on time."</p>
                            <p>"It has been announced that this exposition will be opened on June 1 and Manager Bruce has issued positive instructions that all exhibits must be in place at that time.  Nothing will be left undone to bring about this result and it can be announced with certainty that

                            there will be no delay so far as the Exhibits department is concerned.  There will probably be a few exhibitors who will be unavoidably delayed for some good reasons and these will be admitted to the grounds after June 10, but between May 25 and June 10 no exhibits will be received.  There will be some exhibits which cannot be made ready as early as the opening day, especially in horticulture and agriculture, and these will be received after June 10, but at the time of the opening there will be no confusion, such as is seen at nearly all expositions, caused by exhibitors and their assistants rushing about getting their exhibits installed.  There will be no packing cases scattered about in the aisles and no noise of preparation.  Western push and enterprise will show to the world that it is possible to open a great exposition promptly on time with everything ready."</p>

                            <p>May 1 the floor in each exhibit building will be marked to show the space assigned to each exhibitor, and on that date every exhibitor will be required to commence getting his exhibitor in shape.  Each building will be placed in charge of the superintendent of the department in which the building belongs and this superintendent will be required to see that the rules of the department are complied with.  The office of Manager Bruce will be removed to the grounds on that date and will be established in the Manufactures building, and all operations of installation will be directed from that point.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures building will be under the direction of Superintendent Hardt, who will look after the installation of exhibits will look after the installation of exhibits in that building.  Superintendent F. W. Taylor will be in charge of the Agriculture and Horticulture buildings, Secretary Ford of the Woman's Board of Managers will have charge of the Liberal Arts building, Dr. David T. Day, the mining commissioner, will be in charge of the Mines building; Art Director A. H. Griffiths will have charge of the Art building.  Prof. R. B. Owens will be in charge of the Electricity and Machinery building, Superintendent D. H. Elliott will take charge of the installation of exhibits in the Transportation and Agricultural Implement building.  J. B. Dinsmore will have charge of the Dairy building and E. Whitcomb will be in charge of the Apiary building.  All will be under the general direction of Manager Bruce, who will take up his headquarters on the ground and will devote nearly all of his time to this work.</p>

                            <p>The allotment of space in the several exhibit buildings is virtually completed.  Every building is entirely filled and additional room can only be made by reducing the amount allotted to exhibitors already assigned.  There are very few cases in which this can be done, as nearly all of the exhibitors make their preparations to fill a certain space and cannot change their designs without great expense and loss of time.  For this reason the department is encouraging the erection of buildings by certain desirable classes of exhibitors and the indications are that there will be no spot of ground left unoccupied when the gates are opened.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, March 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;When the house convened this morning great interest was manifested among the members as to the fate of the free homes amendment, which would in all probability be reported by Chairman Sherman of the committee on Indian affairs.  Shortly after convening, Sherman reported the bill to the house with information upon senate amendment and moved nonconcurrence.  This was agreed to with the exception of four paragraphs of the free homes amendment, gilsonite lands in Utah and two minor amendments upon which direct votes were desired.  Among the amendments nonconcurred in was that in the Indian congress paragraph carrying $45,000 for an exhibit at Omaha.  This action was most desired by the Nebraska delegation, although for a time it looked as if the senate amendments might be voted upon seriatim.  The rest of the day was consumed in the discussion of the free <choice><sic>homese</sic><corr>homes</corr></choice> and Uncompahgre reservation affairs.

                            <head type="sub">Letting of the Photographic Concession to Reinhart Clears Up the Mystery Considerably but Leaves Amateurs Uncertain.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The awarding of the contract for the exclusive privilege of taking photographs of the exposition grounds and buildings to F. A. Reinhart of this city has settled one phase of the photograph question, but that portion of the matter which is of peculiar interest to the amateur "fiends" is still undetermined.  So far as the amateurs are concerned, they will be allowed to use hand cameras 4x5 inches, or less, on the grounds on conditions to be hereafter determined, but they will not be allowed to use a tripod under any circumstances.</p>
                            <p>It has been conceded from the beginning of active work on the exposition that the exclusive privilege of taking photographs of the grounds and buildings would be awarded to some professional photographer and the competition for this privilege has been animated.  Fully a dozen photographers have been negotiating for the concession and a great deal of time has been devoted by the Concessions department to making such terms as would do away with many features which the experience of other expositions had proved to be objectionable.  Manager Reed has given his personal attention to the matter and believes that arrangements have now been made which will be entirely satisfactory to all concerned.</p>
                            <p>Definite specifications were drawn for this privilege and every photographer desirous of making a bid for the concession was furnished with a copy of these.  The contract with Official Photographer Reinhart will be drawn in accordance with these specifications.</p>
                            <p>The official photographer is given the exclusive right to make all kinds of photographs on the grounds except tin-types, which may be made on the Midway with the understanding that none of the Midway concessionaires are to be allowed to take photographs, and further excepting the privilege of allowing visitors to use hand cameras, with 4x5 films of plates or smaller sizes, the latter privilege to be under the control of the exposition management, with the understanding that tripods will not be allowed to be used with said hand cameras.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">RIGHTS OF THE CONTRACTOR.</head>
                            <p>The official photographer is given the exclusive right to sell all kinds of photographs within the exposition grounds except those of people or of typical scenes of foreign countries.  He is also given the exclusive right to make and sell photographic views, leaflets and booklets of the grounds, buildings and points of interest within the grounds.  In this connection, the official photographer is required to publish and have for sale on the grounds, not later than July 1, the views, leaflets, booklets, etc., here referred to.  He is also required to publish and keep on sale on the grounds, views of points of interest in and about the city of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>An exception to the rule excluding all photographic machines is made in the case of representative newspapers and periodicals which may desire to send representatives to the grounds for the purpose of taking photographs of scenes of the grounds, exhibits, etc., for reproduction in their respective publications, this feature of the work being placed under the control of the Department of Publicity and Promotion.</p>
                            <p>The official photographer is also given the exclusive right to take the photographs which will be required on the tickets of admission of officers, employes, exhibitors, concessionaires and their employes, as well as purchasers of season or commutation tickets, the price of each of these photographs to be 25 cents.  It is provided, however, in this connection, that the officials and employes of the United States government and proprietors and reporters of newspapers shall be photographed free of cost.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AMATEUR STANDING NOT SETTLED.</head>
                            <p>The regulations regarding which the amateur photographers are most concerned have not yet been perfected, and until some definite plan is agreed on no cameras of any description, excepting those of the official photographer, will be allowed on the grounds.  Ever since the gates have been closed to visitors not in possession of an admission ticket or a pass the Concessions department has been in control of the admission of cameras of every description.  A few permits were issued to persons who applied for them, but since March 1 no permits have been issued to any person and the rule against the admission of cameras to the main court is being rigidly enforced.  No more permits will be issued for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed is now considering the best means of regulating the use of hand cameras and until some definite course of action is agreed on they will not be admitted to the grounds.  He is still undecided whether to offer for sale the exclusive privilege for hand cameras, allowing the concessionaire who secures this privilege to regulate the admission of these instruments, or whether it is more desirable to <unclear reason="torn"/> fee for each instrument.  The latter course was adopted at the World's fair and at Atlanta and Nashville.  When the course to be pursued in connection with hand cameras is decided it will then be made known whether any of these instruments are to be admitted to the grounds before the gates are opened.</p>

                            <p>The plans for the German village on the Midway are progressing and building operations will be commenced in the very near future.  This concession was let some time ago to C. F. Beindorff and J. C. Whipple, both of Omaha, and Mr. Beindorff has about completed the plans for the structures which will constitute the "village".</p>
                            <p>The German village will be located on the bluff tract near the grand plaza and will be quite an elaborate affair.  The famous Heidelberg castle will be reproduced and one of the prominent features will be a restaurant after the fashion of the Bratwurst Glocklein resorts which are to be seen in many parts of Germany.  In this place will be a restaurant, where the bratwurst so popular with Germans will be served, together with other delicatessen so dear to the heart of those who spent their early days in the Vaterland.  There will be a Vienna cafe, a concert garden, a pavilion where there will be vaudeville performances and bazaars for the sale of articles imported from the old country.  Carvers of wood, meerschaum and other wares will be imported for this village, including wood carvers from the Hartz mountains, Bohemian glass blowers, etc.  There will be athletic games, bowling alleys and all the other methods so dear to the Germans.  Negotiations are pending with a female band of Berlin, an organization of fifty-five pieces, for a series of concerts.</p>

The pay roll of these men was made out immediately after the board adjourned and arrangements were made to pay the men off at once.  Commissioner Whitford, who was appointed to take full charge of the building, has arrived in the city and at once hired a small force of men to complete the small amount of work required to finish the building.  The plasterers are "pointing up" their work and there is a small amount of odds and ends to be cleaned up before the building is entirely completed.  E. W. Crane, who has been employed for some time as timekeeper on the building, has been retained as custodian and will have charge of the structure until it is occupied as headquarters.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Bliss and Commissioner Jones Are Hard at Work.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, March 10.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;In anticipation of the passage of the Indian bill containing an appropriation of $45,000 for the Indian congress at Omaha during the life of the exposition Secretary Bliss of the Interior department has requested Commissioner Jones to cast about for material to fitly represent the government and at the same time open correspondence with local officers as to what is needed at Omaha to make this congress, which will be the first in the history of the country, a credit to the government of the United States and an absolute reflection of what has been done for the Indian.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Jones, appreciating that the credit of this congress is largely due to Mr. Rosewater, has requested his presence in Washington with a view of outlining his ideas in relation to the congress.  Both the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of Indian affairs are proceeding upon the theory that the conference on the Indian bill will vote for the retention of the senate amendment, and this is confirmed today by both Senator Allen and Representative Mercer, who say that the conferees have practically made all arrangements to keep the amendment in the bill.  Interest in the congress is growing and there are many predictions heard that is will be a distinctive and novel feature of the exposition.  Secretary Bliss and Commissioner Jones will do all in their power to make the congress, in an ethnological sense, the crowning feature of this administration.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen had called up and passed through the senate today the house bill to extend the time which the Rock Island railroad has to complete its line through Indian Territory.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Beautiful Buildings Erected by Commonwealths, Cities, Counties and Private Firms Will Line a Long Avenue.</head>
                            <p>One of the most important features of the exposition will be the buildings which will be erected by the states, counties or cities as headquarters for the people from the localities represented.  These buildings will be located on the lower end of the large portion of the exposition grounds known as the bluff tract, a most sightly location overlooking the broad valley of the Missouri for miles up and down the river.  The part of this tract set apart for buildings to be erected by outside parties is about half a mile in length and about 800 feet in width.  It is laid out with numerous walks and will be beautifully parked, large trees affording an abundance of shade, and plans being already made for innumerable beds of all kinds of rare and beautiful flowers.</p>
                            <p>There are many very desirable locations on this tract for state and other buildings, but these are being rapidly reserved and this large tract will certainly be liberally dotted with handsome buildings in different designs, all harmonizing fully with the general plan and making this beautiful park one of the most desirable resorts on the entire grounds.</p>
                            <p>Eight states have taken positive steps in the erection of buildings designed to be used as headquarters for the people from those sections who visit the exposition, and several others are going through the preliminaries necessary to bring about this result.  The states which will unquestionably have buildings are these:  Nebraska, Illinois, Montana, Georgia, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri and Arkansas.  Iowa will erect a building if the legislature makes an appropriation sufficient for the purpose, a most desirable location being held for this state despite the clamors of other states which want this site.  Pottawattamie county, Iowa, will have a huge wigwam and Denver will have a handsome city building, the only city building on the grounds, so far as definitely decided.  Philadelphia is still considering the idea of erecting a fac-simile of old Independence hall, and this may be done.  The prospect seems to be good for the erection of state buildings by New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Canada.</p>
                            <p>In addition to these buildings there will be several erected by business houses for the display of their wares.  Those which have taken definite action in the matter and commenced operations for the erection of their buildings are Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. of Chicago, the Ohio Syrup company of Cleveland and Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco company of St. Louis.  A number of other firms are negotiating for space and the number of sites still available for building purposes is rapidly diminishing.</p>

                            <p>A complete system of turnstiles is being put in some of the gates leading into the main court at the exposition grounds and a complete record will be made of every person who pays for admission to the grounds.  These turnstiles will be put at one gate of Sherman avenue and at the Twenty-fourth street entrance.  The Sherman avenue gate will be at the middle of the east side of the Auditorium building, where all of the visitors to the grounds usually alight.  It will be a few yards north of the large gate where teams have been admitted.  The latter gate will be used for all persons having passes to the grounds, and they will not be allowed to enter at the turnstile.  Two gates will be constructed at the Twenty-fourth street entrance, one with a turnstile and the other without that adjunct.  The latter will be used exclusively for persons with passes.</p>
                            <p>W. P. Byrne, for several years connected with the local play houses, has been placed in charge of the pay gates at the grounds under the direction of the Bureau of Admission.  He advised the erection of the turnstiles in order that the employes connected with the Bureau of Admissions may acquire experience in the handling of actual business, both at the gates and in handling the accounts in the office.  In this way he hopes to secure a force of expert gate keepers before the opening day comes and thus do away with a most prolific source of annoyance both to the public and to the exposition authorities.</p>

This committee will consist of F. H. Peavey, vice president for Minnesota; J. Newton Nind and E. J. Phelps.  The committee will be accompanied by Architect MacLeod, who will come to look over the ground and confer with T. R. Kimball, resident architect-in-chief, regarding  the exact date for the Minnesota building.</p>
                            <p>A preliminary sketch of the Minnesota building shows a very attractive structure designed along the lines indicated by Secretary Danforth when in Omaha several weeks ago with the Minnesota delegation on its first trip to the exposition.  This design shows a building constructed of logs with the outer bark still on, something on the order of a Swiss cottage.  This design has been regarded most favorably by the Minnesota <choice><sic>commisssion</sic><corr>commission</corr></choice> and will probably be used in the construction of the state building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BEAUTIFYING THE CITY PARKS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commissioners Arrange for Statuary and Additional Fountains.</head>
                            <p>The Board of Park Commissioners has decided to expend $5,000 for statuary at the exposition grounds on condition that the county and the exposition association will each expend an equal sum and that the entire lot is turned over to the board for the adornment of the various parks after it has served its purpose for the exposition.  It is unofficially understood that this plan will be agreed to, as the statuary will naturally revert to the parks, and this makes it practically certain that the sculptural effects of the exposition will be commensurate with its architectural magnificence.</p>
                            <p>The board has also decided to place a handsome fountain on the west side of Hanscom park.  This will constitute a very ornamental auxiliary to the flower beds and grass plots.  The pattern that has been selected is a rustic effect with what is known as a stork base and two pans.  The ground diameter of the basin is twelve feet and that of the first pan is a little over six feet.  It is over twelve feet high and the figure of a boy holding a huge lily from which the water spurts is the crowning ornamentation.  The fountain complete will cost about $350.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Distribution and Delivery of Mail at the Grounds a Problem.</head>
                            <p>It has not been decided yet what arrangements will be made in regard to mail distribution at the exposition grounds.  Assistant Postmaster Woodard says that all probability the government will establish a postoffice in the Government building and that it will be run either separately or in conjunction with the Omaha office.  He thinks it likely that the mail will be distributed on much the same plan it was at the World's fair, where carriers did the distributing and collecting just as in any city office.  The postal department is very close run at present, and Mr. Woodard is not sure that it will feel like bearing the expense which such a system would entail.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ARRANGING FOR THE BIG WIGWAM.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Regular Weekly Meeting of the Executive Committee is Held.</head>
                            <p>At the regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Exposition association last night a blue print of the exposition grounds was submitted showing the location of the site selected for the Pottawattamie county wigwam, together with a receipt for the amount of the first installment of the ground rental, $250, which had been paid by the committee having the matter in charge.  The site is on Sherman avenue directly opposite the Iowa building, and close to the main entrance.  It is one of the most desirable sites on the ground, and the big tepee will be a most conspicuous object that will arrest the attention of the visitor the moment the gates are opened.  A resolution was passed instructing the wigwam committee to take the necessary steps at once for the purpose of beginning work of construction.  The committee was authorized to confer with a number of the leading architects and builders for the purpose of securing working plans that will be somewhat of a modification of the original plans and will perhaps cheapen the cost of the structure.  One plan will be the use of piling instead of the brick foundation, which will save a cost of 30,000 brick which were originally designed for the foundation.  The piling will be much cheaper and make a much stronger footing for the building, as the upright posts will be bolted to the piling.  Mayor Carson sounded a warning that the building committee must make no mistakes and take no risks in the work; that the fact must not be lost sight of that the building

                            must be constructed to resist severe wind storms and carry heavy weights.  The modified plans must be submitted to the general committee at the next meeting, together with accurate estimates of the total cost.</p>
                            <p>The committee of women having in charge the publication of the women's edition of the Nonpareil reported that the total receipts of the venture were $566.55, the expenses $281.44, leaving a net <choice><sic>tota</sic><corr>total</corr></choice> of $285.51, one-half to be donated to the exposition committee amounting to $142.75.  With the report was a submitted check for the amount and a statement that there was still due and uncollected $49.50, one-half of which would be turned over to the committee when collected.  The committee from the woman's clubs who submitted the report consisted of Mesdames Metcalf, Atkins, Phelps, Reed, Hayden, McBride and Terwilliger.  A vote of thanks was tendered them for their donation.</p>
                            <p>The members of the committee retired to the parlors of the hotel and formulated another plan for the purpose of assisting the association in disposing of the remainder of the exposition buttons, and after a short deliberation notified the association that they desired to meet a committee to convey the proposition to the association.  Prof. Hisey and Dr. Cleaver were appointed and returned with an outline of the plan, which was to take charge of the button sales in the future.  They submitted the names of nearly 100 young girls and boys whom they desire to meet at the ordinary of the Grand hotel on Saturday afternoon and interest in the work of selling the buttons.  Prizes are to be offered for the work.  Each girl or boy who sells ten buttons shall receive three free admission tickets into the exposition grounds, and proportionately more for larger sales. Larger prizes consisting of a bicycle, a gold watch, fine dress pattern, manicure set, etc., are to be offered to the persons selling the highest number, in addition to the regular prizes in the way of admission tickets.  The offer of the women was promptly accepted, and a committee consisting of E. H. Walters, Dr. Cleaver and Prof. Hisey was appointed to confer with them and carry into execution the plans they agree upon.  The secretary was instructed to notify the girls and boys whose names were presented to be at the hotel on Saturday afternoon and have the matter explained to them.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the work on the wigwam must be well under way by the middle of April.</p>
                            <p>The financial report showed that all of the assessments of the members of the association had been paid, ranging from $10 to $25.  The total amount of subscriptions outside of this list and the sale of buttons approximated a little over $2,000, and the total amount of money in the hands of the association with which to begin the construction work is between $2,500 and $3,000.</p>

                            <head type="sub">H. B. Boyles Names a Committee to Arrange for the Affair.</head>
                            <p>Another convention that is coming here this summer is that of the stenographers, the first meeting of what will probably be known as the National Stenographers' association.  H. B. Boyles of this city is carrying on a correspondence which will undoubtedly result in the calling of the convention in Omaha on some days in the summer which are yet to be fixed.</p>
                            <p>The first gathering of the stenographers was held in Nashville during the exposition there last summer.  There were then in attendance about 1,000 delegates from all parts of the country.  At that time the plans of the national association were laid, but the complete organization was left in the hands of a committee, of which Kendrick C. Hill of New York is chairman.  H. B. Boyles of this city was appointed chairman of the subcommittee on organization from this state.</p>
                            <p>A short time ago Chairman Hill wrote to Boyles, stating that he would call the next convention in this city if the proper hall and accommodations were guaranteed.  In response Mr. Boyles has informed the chairman that everything in that line would be offered without expense to the association.  Mr. Boyles believes that there is no doubt that the meeting will be held.  It will be a considerable gathering, since it is estimated that fully the number that attended the Nashville meeting will come here.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Boyles has appointed the following to serve with him on the Nebraska organization subcommittee:  Myron E. Wheeler of Lincoln, George Cocoran of Lincoln, John Maher of Chadron and H. M. Waring of this city.</p>

She says the public is to be given a surprise by having the paper issued very soon, but she refused to divulge the exact time it will make its appearance.</p>

                            <p>Chauncey M. Depew, one of the members of the New York Exposition commission recently appointed by Governor Black, in a letter to the Department of Publicity and Promotion regarding exposition matters says:  "I do not know what our commission will do, or what the legislature will be willing to do.  Personally, I want the state represented as creditably as possible at the exposition."</p>

                            <p>The Ohio Falls Car Manufacturing company of Jeffersonville, Ind., is a recent applicant for space for an exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The senior member of the firm of H. R. Eagle &amp; Co. of Chicago, wholesale dealers in general merchandise direct to the consumer, is in town making arrangements for a large display at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Colonel H. B. Maxson of Reno, vice president for Nevada, writes that there is a great interest being manifested by the people in his jurisdiction in the matter of representation at the exposition, and the territory will be heard from when the time comes.</p>
                            <p>The governor of Michigan has called an extra session of the legislature and the Department of Publicity and Promotion will make a special effort to arouse sufficient interest in that state to produce an appropriation for state participation in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The people of west Florida are becoming aroused to the importance of having their portion of the state represented by an extensive exhibit independent of anything that may be done by the state commission.  They have applied to the Department of Exhibits for space and announce that they will make an extensive exhibit of their resources.</p>
                            <p>Clement Chase has issued a very handsome exposition booklet containing sixteen full page photogravures, printed on heavy enameled paper and bound with ribbon in a parchment cover bearing a handsome design.  Mr. Chase has also issued a series of sixteen souvenir cards on the style of postal cards, presenting on the reverse side in small size the main state buildings.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits is in receipt of a letter from the Los Angeles committee of arrangements, asking if that county can be assigned space where it can erect an immense column of oranges seventy-five feet in height as a portion of its exhibit.  A reply has been sent to the effect that the county will be assigned a space in the Horticultural building directly underneath the dome, where a column ninety feet in height may be erected.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Expects to Enlist Services of Former Members in the Entertainment of Visitors During the Exposition Season.</head>
                            <p>An effort is to be made by the exposition management to revive the <choice><sic>nuerous</sic><corr>numerous</corr></choice> societies formed of natives of certain states which flourished in Omaha a few years ago, and these societies will be utilized to assist in the entertainment of people from other states who may attend the exposition on special occasions.  There were a number of these societies at one time, among them being one composed of natives of Ohio, another made up of people who claimed Pennsylvania as their native state, still another formed by people from Illinois, other representing Maine, Indiana, New York, and so on to the end of the list.  So far as known, these organizations have all lapsed, but Major Clarkkson, assistant to the president of the exposition, on whose shoulders rests the burden of working out the details of providing for the entertainment of visitors on special occasions, believes that these societies should be revived, and that their old <choice><sic>mebmers</sic><corr>members</corr></choice> should assist the exposition in arranging to devise plans for bringing large numbers of people to the exposition from these states and providing suitable programs for their entertainment.  It is Major Clarkson's idea to have special "days" when arrangements will be made to provide special attractions for the people from a certain state and the members of the society composed of natives of that state will be asked to assist in making the visit entertaining.  For instance, there will be an "Ohio day," when excursions will be run from all parts of Ohio and members of the Ohio society will be expected to fill places on the entertainment committee and assist in making the event an enjoyable one.  It is believed that the presence of former residents of Ohio would go a long way towards making the visitors feel at home and would do much to induce them to prolong their stay and come again with all their friends.  The same would be true of all the other societies.</p>
                            <p>Major Clarkson desires to communicate with any of the officers or members of these state societies regarding this matter, and invites them to call at his office in the Paxton block.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee Comes to Omaha to Award the Work of Construction.</head>
                            <p>Chairman J. C. Koch and Treasurer A. C. Clas of the Wisconsin Exposition commission are in the city for the purpose of letting the contract for the erection of the Wisconsin building on the exposition grounds.  Bids for the construction were taken from local contractors several days ago and final preparations for commencing the construction will be commenced before the Wisconsin representatives leave the city.</p>
                            <p>The Wisconsin building will stand on the bluff tract, directly west of the Illinois building, being just south of the grand plaza.  It will be sixty feet square and the cornice will be about thirty-five feet from the ground.  The plans were made by the firm of Ferry &amp; Clas of Milwaukee, and show a very pleasing building of classic style.  The most elaborate portion of the exterior will be the main entrance, four <choice><sic>immence</sic><corr>immense</corr></choice> fluted Corinthian columns supporting a broad pediment, forming a most imposing front.  The whole building is Corinthian in style and will form a most pleasing contrast to its nearest neighbors, the Illinois building and the Nebraska building.</p>
                            <p>About $10,000 will be spent for the building and its embellishment.  Like the Illinois and Nebraska buildings, the Wisconsin headquarters will be covered with staff.  The lumber for the building has been donated by the large lumber concerns of Wisconsin and all of this material is now on the road to Omaha.  The plumbing and other material required for the proper fitting of the interior of the building has also been contributed by Wisconsin manufacturers.  A prominent feature of the Wisconsin building will be the central court.  Almost the entire lower floor will be an immense rotunda and in the center of this will be a large <choice><sic>funtain</sic><corr>fountain</corr></choice>, the basin to contain specimens of every variety of fish which frequent Wisconsin waters.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Koch stated that the commission has made no effort to prepare for a state exhibit of Wisconsin's resources, either in agriculture or manufactured articles, but has devoted its time and energies to inducing manufacturers and others to make exhibits.  He said the work in this line had been successful and the state will be represented by a large number of exhibitors, covering all lines of products.</p>

General Albert Pike is widely known as the founder of the so-called southern jurisdiction of the Scottish rite, who died a few years ago after a long residence in Washington city, where the headquarters of the rite were maintained.  His former residence in Little Rock is said to be a fine example of the prevailing architecture of southern homes.</p>

                            <p>In due time this committee returned from Mr. Kirkendall's office with the assurance that the required space would be allowed subject to the same regulations and restrictions as the space for the McKinley home.  Mr. Kirkendall requested that plans of the proposed building be made and some idea given of the amount of space required and when they are completed he is ready to go to the grounds with the committee and aid in picking out the location.  Some time after the committee had reported a formal letter was received from Manager Kirkendall, which was the exact counterpart of one sent to Canton, O., regarding space for the McKinley home.  It provides that there shall be no competitive exhibits in the building and nothing offered for sale.  It was stated that this will preclude the giving away of campaign literature in either building.</p>
                            <p>This communication was placed on file and its acknowledgement was ordered, with the information that the committee on construction will work in harmony with and report to Manager Kirkendall.</p>
                            <p>The committee on permanent organization reported a plan whereby the management of the affairs of the enterprise shall be vested in a president, a vice president, a secretary and treasurer, with finance, auditing, construction, literature and souvenir committees.  This report also recommended G. W. Berge for chairman, I. J. Dunn for vice president, F. T. Ransom for secretary and J. B. Kitchen for treasurer.  For the committees the report favored the following:</p>
                            <p>Finance and auditing&#8212;J. B. Kitchen, T. J. Evans, J. H. Broady, G. A. Magney and C. M. Hunt.</p>
                            <p>Construction&#8212;F. B. Hibbard, O. N. Humphrey, Willis Hudspeth, A. H. Hipple and I. J. Dunn.</p>
                            <p>Literature&#8212;J. H. Broady, J. J. Saville, James Manahan, E. E. Brown and G. W. Berge.</p>
                            <p>Souvenirs&#8212;James Manahan, C. M. Hunt, T. J. Evans and J. H. Broady.</p>
                            <p>The report was adopted as presented and Mr. Ransom was authorized to engage a stenographer at $10 a week.</p>
                            <p>The committee on construction was directed to have plans of the Bryan home in Lincoln prepared at once and report at the next meeting the probable cost of the projected building.</p>
                            <p>The Paxton hotel was made headquarters and it was determined to meet again Thursday afternoon.  The finance committee was requested to at that time present a plan for raising the necessary funds by popular subscription.</p>
                            <p>The proposition of the Canton people is to reproduce the McKinley home and prepare also an exhibit of the manufactures of Canton and in his reply to the request for space for the Bryan homestead Manager Kirkendall adhered so strictly to the program in the McKinley project that he referred to an exhibit of the manufactured products of Lincoln.  It is not understood, however, that the committee intends to include any such in the exhibit.</p>

                            <p>Considerable comment has been created among the newspaper publishers of the state by a recent announcement that Mr. Rosewater, as a manager of the exposition, has been enabled to play into the hands of Mr. Rosewater, as the publisher of a newspaper, to his great advantage in the latter capacity.  It has just been announced that he is soon to issue a <choice><sic>pictoral</sic><corr>pictorial</corr></choice> supplement to the Bee, for which he will draw the neat sum of $3,200 out of the exposition exchequer.  Mr. Rosewater is a lucky man.  He will be the only Nebraska publisher who has been able to get a finger into the till of the great enterprise and he will at one fell swoop pull out of it nearly as much as his subscription to the exposition, concerning which subscription listening Nebraskans have heard now and then from Mr. Rosewater's own lips.  Speaking on this subject a well known Nebraska newspaper man said:</p>
                            <p>"It looks to me decidedly cheeky to allow Rosewater that $3,200 for the circulation of a picture that is bound to prove a great feature for his paper and which one would think he would be willing to exploit free to the exposition as a bit of merited newspaper enterprise.  You will remember that the Bee was given the privilege, or got it in some way, of sending out the official bird's eye view of the grounds as a supplement, and he must have made a handsome figure out of it, for he charged 10 cents a copy for the paper, and there were firms in Omaha who sent out hundreds of them.  It seems to me that if I were running a newspaper enterprise of the magnitude of the Bee in Omaha I could somehow find a way to send out these pictures which the Bee is to send out and do it as a stroke of enterprise without asking any $3,200 from the exposition for it.  The exposition has received a great deal of free and valuable advertising from the newspapers of the land on the theory that it is an enterprise that merits the support of the press, but none of the publishers who have opened their columns to its announcements would have done so with the freedom that they have had it ever been supposed that the editor of a local paper who has a pull as a manager would get his gaff into the treasury for over $3,000 for a work which his duty as a publisher to the community should prompt him to do without compensation from the exposition management and which will inure to the great advantage of the paper, possibly to a greater degree than the money that is to be received for the work.  For my part I think it is treating the papers in other cities decidedly shabby and while the management may have been led into this expense by the discovery that it is the only way to keep in the expense I do not think it does any very great degree of credit to Mr. Rosewater or the Bee to have it announced that the management has had to pay him $3,200 for what most any newspaper would have done for its community without other pay than the prestige it would give the paper and the money that could be made from the sale of the papers."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Art Gallery to Be a Feature at the Omaha Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The Illinois commission is contemplating an addition to the Illinois building, to be used as an art gallery, which will prove an elegant and attractive feature of the beautiful state building now nearing completion in the grounds of the transmississippi exposition at Omaha.  The principal feature of the art gallery will doubtless be the four large oil paintings of the world's fair, each ten by twenty-five feet in size, thus affording another opportunity of viewing the "white city" of memory.</p>
                            <p>The Illinois Stock Breeders' Association will see that the breeders of fine stock are well represented, while the state horticultural society will probably make such an exhibit as will call attention to the fact that Illinois is a great fruit growing state and grows more and better apples than any other state in the union.  The exhibit of the agricultural implements manufactured in Illinois will probably exceed in character and amount any previous exhibit from this state.  The coal operators have under consideration a grand exhibit of the great coal and mining interests of Illinois.</p>
                            <p>The transmississippi exposition promises to excel all previous expositions ever held in this country, always excepting the great world's fair in 1893.  The transmississippi states are so great in area that if laid down upon the map they would cover several kingdoms of the old world and overlap the territory usually assigned as the "markets of the world."  They are peculiarly the market of Illinois and lie at her very door.  Over 50,000 square feet have already been secured for Illinois exhibitors, and more is in process of negotiation.  The managers of the exposition have extended the time for acceptance of applications for space from March 1 to March 15, although they have had to increase their accommodation for exhibits by building annexes to some of the main buildings and putting up some entirely new ones.</p>
                            <p>Exhibitors who have not yet secured space have no time to spare, and should make their applications at once.  The office of the Illinois transmississippi commission is at room 206, 218 LaSalle street.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Washington, March 12.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;The suggestion recently made to the city of Canton by Senator Thurston, that a reproduction of the famous McKinley homestead be erected at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition has aroused considerable comment both in Omaha and in this city.  On the seventh of the month an application to erect such a building was made to the exposition directory and permission and a site were granted.  The free silver organ of Nebraska, the World-Herald thought it saw a political scheme in the concession and in a triple-leaded, double-column editorial called upon all of the white metal faith to erect a reproduction of the Bryan homestead on the exposition grounds, and suggests that at least one room of the proposed fac-simile be devoted to the distribution of literature telling of the dire effects of the single gold standard and the benefit to be derived by returning to bimetallism.  It also says that the proposed reproduction of the McKinley home is by "idolators of the single gold standard."</p>
                            <p>The Washington Post in commenting editorially on the World-Herald editorial, rightly states that it would be improper to fight again the battle of '96 at the exposition, but says it would be at the height of impropriety to erect on the grounds a reproduction of the home of a private citizen.</p>

The senator did not intimate anything of a political nature in his interview with The Repository correspondent and the idea that a collection of souvenirs would add to the attractiveness of the industrial exhibit, was only intimated.  At any rate, Canton again secures considerable free advertising from the proposition, which every one here appears to think should be taken up by the board of trade and Business Men's association.  Letters received by Canton people in this city from officials of the exposition show that the Omaha people are anxious to have this unique exhibit.  One writer says that "the world will be astonished at the display, the magnitude and beauty of the grounds.  From an architectural point of view, it will be superior to the World's Fair.  The buildings are not so large but they are better grasped."</p>
                            <p>However, the World-Herald has viewed the proposition of Senator Thurston from a very</p>

In giving me this interview the senator was actuated solely by a desire to further the interests of the exposition and incidentally to benefit Canton.  That the concession for the erection of the building was so easily obtained was evidence that the idea was so considered by the directors of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The women who have undertaken the work of disposing of the remainder of the exposition buttons had a most successful meeting in the ordinary of the Grand hotel yesterday afternoon.  The committee of women having the matter in charge consists of Mrs. George T. Phelps, Mrs. B. S. Terwilliger, Mrs. Thomas Metcalf, Mrs. R. J. McBride, Mrs. J. B. Atkins and Mrs. S. H. Foster.  In accordance with the arrangements made at the meeting of the Exposition association on Thursday night at which the secretary of the association was instructed to invite a large number of young people to meet the committee, there was a large number of boys and girls present when the women were ready to explain their scheme for selling buttons to raise funds for the building of the wigwam.  The committee outlined the plan and made it very clear to the boys and girls, who entered into the scheme with great enthusiasm.  According to the plan any person who is recommended by the committee can engage in the sale of buttons and for every five buttons sold at $1 each, which is the uniform price, will be given one admission ticket to the Transmississippi Exposition.  If the sales reach the number of 1,000 buttons, the following prizes will be awarded:</p>
                            <p>To the person selling the greatest number of buttons, a first-calling, high grade bicycle, for either lady or gentleman.</p>
                            <p>To the girl or boy selling the second highest number of buttons will be given each a fine gold watch.</p>
                            <p>The fourth prize will be a high class camera and outfit; and there will be other prizes, the exact nature of which has not been determined.</p>
                            <p>Should the sale of the buttons reach 2,000 in number, the prizes will be doubled.  The time limit for the sale is June 1, at which time all prizes will be awarded.  This competition is open to all who desire to take part, and application should be made to one of the members of the women's committee.  The Exposition association is represented in this work by a committee consisting of Mr. E. H. Walters, Dr. J. H. Cleaver and Prof. J. C. Hisey.</p>

                            <p>SAN FRANCISCO, March 11.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;It is now practically certain that there will be a state exposition held in this city in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of statehood.  The suggestion that the golden wedding of the state to the union be made the occasion of a grand exposition has met with hearty approval on all sides.  The merchants and citizens of San Francisco have pledged their hearty support and several of the mayors representing interior cities of the state, have also promised aid.  Mayors Land of Sacramento, M. P. Snyder of Los Angeles, Valentine Koch of San Jose, J. A. Fuller of Napa, W. T. Ellis of Marysville, C. J. Craycroft of Fresno, D. C. Reed of San Diego and Charles P. Patterson of Pomona have expressed their favorable feelings toward the proposed celebration.  They are united in the opinion that the exposition should be held, not alone to represent and fittingly advertise the resources and products of California, but those of the junior states admitted after our state.  We have in addition been promised the aid of several of the contiguous states, and by a concentration of action we will be able to hold an exposition in 1900 that will draw the attention of the entire world to the country west of the Rockies.</p>
                            <p>While everyone admits that an exposition would prove of incalculable benefit there is not a unanimity of opinion as to just when it should be held.  There are some who fear that the Paris fair, which will be held the same year, would prove a counter attraction and keep many away who would visit us if our exposition should not be held until 1901.</p>
                            <p>The time of holding the exposition will be probably fixed by a committee to be appointed by Mayor Phelan within the next few days.</p>
                            <p>Governor Budd has sent out invitations to the chief magistrates of adjoining states asking them to join us in making the semi-centennial one that will redound to the credit of the entire Pacific slope.</p>

The first was an official communication from the secretary of the Painters' and Decorators' union, notifying the committee that at the last regular meeting of the union a resolution had been unanimously adopted protesting against closing the gates on Sunday.  The second communication was from Rev. J. R. Getty, who signed himself as pastor of the Methodist Episcopal church of DeWitt, Neb.  He stated that he had felt very friendly toward the exposition and had about concluded to attend and advise all his friends to do the same, but since learning that the gates might be kept open on Sunday he had concluded to withdraw his support and that of the 200 members of his congregation unless it was decided to close the gates on the first day of the week.</p>

                            <p>W. H. Sutherlin, vice president of the Montana Exposition board, arrived in Omaha last night and will take immediate steps to begin the Montana building.  As soon as the plans are approved by the architect-in-chief work will be commenced.  The building is to be two stories in height and the general plan of it is not quite completed.  Mr. Sutherlin says the exhibits are largely prepared and will be shipped as soon as a place is provided for them.  The exhibits of mineral will be finer than anything the state has ever sent out.  The leading mines of the state will each have their separate departments and an effort will be made to arrange the ores so as to show how they are disposed in the veins and their general condition before they are taken from the mine.  Professor Craig of Missoula, professor of geology in the State University of Montana, has charge of the geological exhibit and will have a classified collection of the many formations that crop out in the state.  Professor Craig has also prepared specimens of all the fish found in Montana.  The timber exhibit is under the supervision of Lieutenant Abron of the State Agricultural school.  The largest tree in the state will be brought to Omaha and the commission is having some difficulty in deciding between several contestants for the honor.  Montana will also have an art exhibit to which Russell, the cowboy artist, will be the chief contributor.  Mr. Sutherlin expresses the opinion that the thing which will create the most surprise is the fine exhibit of agricultural products which is being prepared.  He says that the state has always been considered a mining state and a few people know of its agricultural resources.</p>

                            <p>A number of new voices have been tested during the last week by Mr. Kelly and will be added to the chorus at the next meeting.</p>
                            <p>Letters have been sent to all of the leading singers of the city, inviting them to aid the exposition by giving their assistance to the chorus and becoming members of it.</p>
                            <p>An exposition chorus will be organized in Council Bluffs some time this week.  Choral Director Kelly will call a meeting of the singers of the Iowa city within a few days and will form a chorus which will be drilled by him on the same music rehearsed by the Omaha chorus.</p>

                            <p>One of the county commissioners last night in speaking of the condition of the proceeds of the bonds voted by the county in aid of the exposition said: "At the adjourned meeting of the board, to be held next Wednesday, one of the commissioners will offer a resolution appropriating the sum of $2,500 to aid in the construction and maintenance of the Boys' and Girls' building.  It is certain that the resolution will be adopted by a unanimous vote, as all of the members have expressed themselves as being favorable to the project.  We have reached this conclusion after making a careful estimate of the funds that will be required to collect and maintain the Douglas county exhibit.  While we are under no obligation to expend the entire proceeds of the $100,000 of exposition bonds we feel that we are justified in assisting in the construction of the Boys' and Girls' building."</p>

                            <p>When informed of the aid that the county commissioners had promised in the erection of the Boys' and Girls' building Secretary Wakefield said:  "This means that the building is certain and that it will be constructed along the original lines proposed.  Up to this time it has been doubtful about the Woman's board being able to raise sufficient funds to carry out the original ideas, that of having a building to cost $8,000.  Now, however, all doubts are removed, as the money for construction is practically all in sight.  The women have raised about $4,000 and $1,500 will be realized from the Hatchet, which with the $2,500 that the county will appropriate will make up the $8,000 required.  The maintenance of the building will require considerable cash, but I think that this is all provided for.  The exposition people have given the concession privileges of the building to the board and then there is a prospect that $1,500 will be secured from another source.  With this money all in sight the building is a go, and I am of the opinion that it will be one of the features of the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Progress at Kountze Park Since March 18, 1897, is Wonderful.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The exposition ground is about the liveliest place in town and the manner in which the work of preparation is being pushed is an example of energy and push which gives great promise of the miracle to be accomplished in transforming the rough tract of broken ground into a park of beauty and a city of palaces.  It is just one year since work was commenced on the construction of the exposition buildings and the preparation of the grounds.  March 18, 1897, was the date on which the first stake was set for the <choice><sic>gradens</sic><corr>gardens</corr></choice>, but since that time the transformation which has taken place is marvelous.  The work has gone steadily on, the unusually open winter having made it possible to work out of doors continuously, and while no great effort has been made to rush the work, the progress has been satisfactory.  Within the last few weeks, however, the greatest activity has been displayed about the grounds and the work of preparation is being pushed with energy.  An army of men is employed and the change that has been wrought in the appearance of the grounds in that time is fully as remarkable as the change that has been made by the erection of the buildings.</p>
                            <p>Persons who have not visited the grounds for the last month will be surprised to find that the bare and bleak bluff tract, which was devoid of trees except along the edge of the bluff, has been transformed into a perfect forest.  Trees forty feet in height and from six to ten inches in diameter dot the tract on every side, being arranged according to a well conceived plan, and shrubbery in profusion is growing where none grew before.  The same is true with regard to the main court, trees and shrubbery being used here to the best advantage, particular attention being paid to the requirements of the stiff design prevailing in this portion of the grounds.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CHANGES NATURE'S FACE.</head>
                            <p>All of these improvements are being carried on under the direction of Rudolf Ulrich, the landscape architect engaged for the purpose.  Over 200 men are working under his direction.  Trees and shrubbery have been hauled to the grounds by the carload and are banked on the grand plaza on the bluff tract until required in working out the detailed design in each portion of the grounds.  The result of this work has been to change entirely the general appearance of the entire exposition grounds, the greatest change being apparent on the bluff tract, where the trees and shrubs are used much more liberally than in any other portion.  The walks are bordered with large trees to afford ample shade in the summer and the bushes are used very freely along the fence and at points where a background of green will add to the general effect.</p>
                            <p>The making of roadways about the grounds is also progressing fully as rapidly.  The contractor having charge of making the roadways on the bluff tract commenced work the first of last week, the start being made on the broad avenue which will extend entirely through the Midway.  This roadway will be seventy feet in width and will extend from the grand plaza to the north viaduct and from this viaduct directly west to Twentieth street.  The avenue will be macadamized, as will all the walks on the bluff tract.  A twelve-ton roller is being used in the work and the top dressing of gravel, well rolled, will prevent any possibility of dust.</p>
                            <p>Work will be commenced tomorrow on the walks in the main court.  It has been decided to make these walls of brick laid in three inches of sand.  A large force of men under Mr. Urich will be employed on this tract tomorrow and the laying of walks and making of parks will be carried on at the same time, the earth excavated for the walks being utilized in making the parks.  The work will be commenced at the east end of the main court and extended to the west end as fast as possible.</p>

                            <p>In preparation for this work, the staff contractors have been very busy for the last two or three days cleaning up the debris about the buildings at the east end of the main court.  This work has been nearly completed about the buildings east of Twentieth street and the sheds used by the contractors for workshops have disappeared.  Smith &amp; Eastman, the staff contractors, will proceed at once to finish the little work remaining to be done on the buildings east of Twentieth street and the east end of the main court will soon take on a finished appearance.</p>
                            <p>The laying of storm sewers and conduits for electric light wires has been completed at the east end of the main court and the buildings in that portion of the grounds have been completely wired for electric lights.  The west half of the court is being pushed with might and main and will be completed within a very short time.</p>
                            <p>The government building is keeping up with its excellent record in making progress.  The work of the carpenters is now concentrated on the huge dome and this is rapidly nearing completion.  The scaffolding which completely filled the interior of the dome has been removed and a small staging in the extreme top is all that obstructs a view of the full structure.  The height of the dome inside is over 100 feet.  Preparations are being made to place the <choice><sic>collossal</sic><corr>colossal</corr></choice> figure of Liberty Enlightening the World in position on the extreme top of the lantern crowning the dome and within a few days this towering figure will be a land mark in full view from all parts of town.  The west wall of both wings of this building are covered with staff and the scaffolding will be removed at once.  Work on the east front is making rapid progress.</p>

                            <p>As the principal object of the government exhibit at the exposition is to show the people of the United States what the government is doing and the manner in which it is done, the Department of State has paid particular attention to making an elaborate and extensive exhibit of its functions and the methods adopted by it for transacting its business.  For this purpose a brief history of the department has been printed for free distribution, setting forth the methods of transacting business in each bureau, beginning with the receipt of the business matter in the department and then showing in consecutive order the progress of such business matter, through the various bureaus and official hands, until the same is finally disposed of and notice thereof duly given to the proper party.  This will be more fully explained by actual examples of work properly arranged in cases, in a convenient and compact form, which, together with photographs of the different rooms in the department, will make an instructive and comprehensive exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Particular attention will be given to the method of applying for and procuring passports, the different blank forms used in applying for them and the places where they may be obtained.</p>

                            <p>The historical archives of the department contain many rare collections of papers and letters written by men connected with the foundation of the government.  There will be on exhibition one volume of the "Washington Papers," containing manuscript letters of George Washington, including that of December 29, 1783, resigning his commission as general of the army.  This collection comprises 313 volumes.  There is one volume in each of the following collections in the exhibit: The Madison papers, in seventy-five volumes; the Hamilton papers, in sixty-five volumes; the Jefferson papers, in 131 volumes; the Monroe papers, in twenty-two volumes, and the Franklin papers, in thirty-four volumes.  These papers were all purchased by the government.  There will be also the diaries of Washington, volume 1, May to August, 1781; volume ii, August 14 to November 5, 1781; volume iii, September 2 to October 4, 1784; the commission of General Washington as commander-in-chief, from the archives of congress (this is the original engrossed parchment surrendered by him at Annapolis), and Washington's meteorological record, 1799, which probably contains the last words written by him.</p>
                            <p>The department has in its custody the original Declaration of Independence, but this precious document is so faded that it became necessary to protect it from the light.  A fac simile will be exhibited, with thirty-eight portraits of the signers.  Accompanying these will be an artotype of the original rough draft containing interlineations and corrections by Adams and Franklin, a reproduction of the original petition to the king of England, October 26, 1774, presented to him by Franklin, and also an artotype of the original Constitution of the United States, with thirty-six portraits of the signers, making an interesting and instructive exhibit.  These artotype reproductions are so like the originals that they are esteemed equally good for exhibition.</p>

                            <p>There will be a fine collection of autograph letters from foreign officials and celebrities to the presidents of the United States, among them being one from Robespierre, Barere; Carnot; Louis, king of France; Napoleon I; Jerome Bonaparte; Queen Victoria; Alexander I of Russia; William I, emperor of Germany; President Diaz of Mexico; Ranavalamonica, queen of Madagascar, and Chulalongkorn, king of Siam.  The autographs of the presidents are shown in original proclamations on various subjects, the only signatures lacking being those of President William Henry Harrison and President James A. Garfield, both of whom died before signing one.</p>
                            <p>There will be a set of portraits of the secretaries of state of the United States, maps showing the growth of the United States' diplomatic and consular service; maps showing the expansion of the United States under treaty provisions; Andrew Jackson's sword; swords presented to the United States by Japan and Siam; Malay krises captured from pirates; a large gold medal set with diamonds, containing a fine cameo with a representation of Columbus discovering America, designed and presented to the United States by the sultan of Turkey in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America; a statuette of George Washington by Baron Marchetti from the original study and model by his master, Houdon of Paris, in 1785-90, for an equestrian statue, which, according to Thomas Jefferson, then United States minister to France, was sent to America by Houdon with the expectation of receiving an order from the congress of the United States to have it cast in bronze, but the model was destroyed by fire in Washington, leaving this statuette as the only survival.  It was in the possession of the Rit. Hon. George Young of Edinburgh, Scotland, and at the time of the Chicago exposition he presented it to the United States, and it was placed in the custody of this department.</p>
                            <p>Two flags of much interest will be exhibited, one, a silk flag woven in one piece, paid for by subscriptions received from 25,000 weavers of Lyons, France, and presented to the United States as a durable expression of their sympathy at the death of President Abraham Lincoln; the other is the first American flag raised over Alaska.</p>
                            <p>A photograph of the Bartholdi Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World, now standing in the harbor of New York, together with the original deed of gift from France and the acceptance of the same by the United States; photographs of several of the buildings occupied by the Department of State; the seal of the United States, the obverse of which is the legal representation of the coat of arms, emblazoned in oils according to the provisions of the act of congress creating it; the development of the seal shown by illustrations reproduced from the manuscript reports of the committees of the Continental congress showing the various designs submitted; photographs of buildings occupied by some of our consuls in various parts of the world, and a number of minor objects too numerous to mention in detail, will complete the exhibit.</p>

This feature of the Midway will occupy a space 400 feet in length on the upper end of the bluff tract, extending from the north viaduct to the permanent brick building at Manderson street.  The most imposing structure on the street will be a mosque, where the inhabitants of the street will hold their religious services.  a large theater will be another important feature and in this will be given the amusements which have come to be regarded as a necessary adjunct to the Cairo concession.

                            <head type="sub">Paper Issued by the Women's Board of Managers is Out.</head>
                            <p>The famous Hatchet has made its appearance at last.  It has been turned out by the printers and is now in the hands of the managing editor, the business manager, the circulation manager and all the other managers.  The papers for the towns in the state will be sent out by express at once and those intended for circulation in Omaha will be distributed Monday.</p>
                            <p>The patronesses appointed for the several schools will act as distributing agents for the subscriptions which were taken by the school children.  The papers will be sent to these patronesses Monday and given by them to the pupils who secured the subscriptions and thus delivered to the subscribers.  The paper will also be on sale at all of the principal news stands, the proprietors of these having agreed to handle them without the usual commission.</p>
                            <p>A corps of boys will be enlisted Monday by the circulation manager and will thoroughly canvass the entire business district of the city and endeavor to dispose of all the papers.  These boys will not receive any commission, all of the profits from the paper being designed to aid in the construction of the Girls' and Boys' building on the exposition grounds.  The women hope to realize a profit <unclear reason="covered"/> $1,000 on this paper and this amount <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Typographically, the Hatchet is a very handsome publication.  The cover is of ivory enamelled paper and a novel idea is shown on the front page of the cover.  There is nothing on it to indicate the name of the paper or the nature of the contents.  All that appears is a design of oval shape, with twenty tiny baby faces peeping out, while the center is filled with a larger picture.  All of these little faces are portraits in half-tone engraving, and the effect is extremely pretty and suitable for framing.  Inside, the contents are found to be fully as inviting as the cover.  The style of the paper is very neat and artistic and the work is well done, resulting in a very handsome publication.  The reading matter is well selected, being largely the work of children, but is devoid of the air of <choice><sic>chidishness</sic><corr>childishness</corr></choice> which might be <choice><sic>anticpiated</sic><corr>anticipated</corr></choice>.  Portraits of children are scattered through the pages and there are also engravings of the exposition buildings, not omitting the Girls' and Boys' building, which is shown in a handsome cut.</p>
                            <p>The issue of the paper was 25,000 copies of which about 15,000 have already been sold by subscription.  The women expect to dispose of the remainder within a very few days by active canvassing and they urge the people to buy them and send them to their friends in all parts of the country.</p>

                            <head type="sub">City Electrician Schurig Has a Plan to Provide for Exposition Display.</head>
                            <p>City Electrician Schurig is considering a scheme by which the streets in the business district may by illuminated all through the exposition with the funds that have been provided for use during the week of the Ak-Sar-Ben festivities.  He says that the system of stringing incandescent lights along the streets is at the best very unsatisfactory.  The temporary construction that supports the lights is not sufficiently substantial to withstand the wind, and it is impossible to get the best results by keeping the lights up to the required candle power.  His plan contemplates the erection of substantial arches over the principal intersections which will afford a solid support for the lights and which will stand as long as they are wanted.  The iron motor poles that now stand on the street corners will furnish the vertical supports for the arches.  The latter can be very inexpensively constructed of angle iron steel with a strip of thin galvanized iron underneath to protect the lamps from the weather.  Mr. Schurig suggests that if the business establishments on each corner will provide the arches the funds appropriated by the council will be sufficient to furnish the lights through the exposition.  The expense of an arch on each intersection will be very little after it is divided among the various business firms in the vicinity.  Then the business district will be attractively illuminated during the entire exposition, and it will be very easy to add some additional effects during Ak-Sar-Ben week.  The scheme has not been fully worked out, but Mr. Schurig will obtain bids for the construction cost, and then the matter will rest with the business men interested.  It is believed that the idea can be successfully carried out at a cost that will allow the down town business concerns to secure a permanent illumination in front of their places of business for very few dollars each.</p>

                            <p>CHADRON, Neb., March 12.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;It is practically assured the Chadron will be represented at the encampment of the Nebraska National Guard in Omaha during the Transmississippi Exposition, by a company from this city.  Adjutant General Barry was in Chadron Thursday looking over the field with a view of reporting to the State Military board on the advisability of establishing a company here.  He was most favorably impressed and stated that he would recommend the organization of a company of National guards.  The business men and young men of the city are a unit in their desires for such an organization and that it would be a success is a certainty.</p>

                            <head type="main">PLANS FOR PUBLIC COMFORT</head>
                            <head type="sub">HOW TO CARE FOR VISITING CROWDS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Matters Still in a Nebulous State, Although Much Thought and Discussion Has Been Bestowed Thereon.</head>
                            <p>The providing of accommodations for the convenience of the general public at the exposition is one of the things which has been receiving a great deal of attention at the hands of the executive committee for several months.  This is a very large subject and one with many branches.  With an average daily attendance of fully 40,000 people, which the most conservative admit is a low estimate, the accommodations of different kinds which must be provided must necessarily be calculated on a huge scale.</p>
                            <p>The most important consideration is water.  With the warm weather which will unquestionably prevail during the greater part of the exposition season, thousands of gallons of drinking water will be consumed each day and arrangements will have to be made for having water tanks at every hand.  Many people from abroad will decline to drink Missouri river water, notwithstanding it can be demonstrated that it is about the purest water to be had anywhere, but thousands will insist on having water from some of the well known mineral springs.  At the World's fair water of this kind was sold at different points about the grounds in <choice><sic>mechanial</sic><corr>mechanical</corr></choice> vendors, a penny in the slot producing a glass of the sparkling liquid from the tank imbedded in ice.  Huge water tanks with ice in the water and others with ice surrounding the water receptacle abounded on every side.  The lesson imparted by the state fair in Omaha in 18985 is an example of the effect of neglecting the water supply.</p>
                            <p>Another feature almost equally important is the providing of ample accommodations for eating.  Several concessions have been let for eating places of various kinds, and two large restaurants will be in operation in the great buildings which are now being erected at the east end of the main viaduct on the bluff tract.  There will be several restaurants on the Midway, but these will be very largely for the convenience of the employes of the concessions in which they are located.  A restaurant will be located on Twentieth street just north of the Administration arch and another at some point in the main court to be determined upon.  In the event of a great rush of people, however, these places would be literally swamped.</p>
                            <p>Arrangements have not yet been made for lavatories and closets and this is the feature which has been the subject of the greatest discussion on the part of the executive committee.  The main discussion has been directed to the point of whether to provide these accommodations without charging a fee for their use, or to establish both pay and free accommodations.  This matter has been discussed time after time and no conclusion reached, there being a decided difference of opinion in the committee.  For that reason no work of preparation has yet been commenced, although a number of propositions have been before the committee for several months.</p>
                            <p>The care of the sick on the grounds is another matter <choice><sic>whih</sic><corr>which</corr></choice> comes under the classification of public comfort, but in this feature ample provision has been made.  A hospital will be constructed on Twentieth street just north of the Administration arch, and this will be equipped with all modern conveniences and will be in charge of a corps of physicians.  An ambulance of the most improved pattern has been purchased and is now in the city.  A hospital corps will be organized and sick people will be well cared for.</p>
                            <p>Little progress has been made in the matter of boot black stands, the local artists in that line being imbued with the idea that there is very little profit in conducting a plant on the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MINNESOTA SELECTS ITS SPACE.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commissioners Arrange for Exhibits and Secure a Building Site.</head>
                            <p>Minnesota will be creditably represented at the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  The exposition authorities have had this assurance for some time.  But the assurance was transformed into fact on the occasion of the visit of a portion of the commission of Minnesota to the exposition here yesterday.</p>
                            <p>In the party were:  F. H. Peavey, vice president of the exposition commission of Minnesota; E. J. Phelps, J. Newton Nind and James Alan MacLeod, all of Minneapolis.  They arrived in Omaha yesterday morning, spent nearly the entire day at the exposition grounds and returned to Minneapolis last evening at 6 o'clock.  The party comprised three of the working members of the commission and the architect of the Minnesota state building at the exposition, Mr. MacLeod.</p>
                            <p>While at the exposition grounds the visitors selected space for the exhibits of Minnesota to the extent of nearly 8,000 square feet.  This is exclusive of that which will be occupied by the state's own building.  In the Agricultural building all the available space that was left unpromised was taken by the Minnesotans.  It amount to about 1,000 square feet.  In the building devoted to the Mining industries about 2,000 square feet was reserved.  In the Dairy, Apiary and Horticultural buildings the Minnesota men were informed that they could have all the space they needed, and they expect to take advantage of this offer by making liberal displays in each of the buildings named.</p>
                            <p>The Minnesota state building will be one of the most attractive of the smaller buildings on the exposition grounds.  A site for its location was definitely selected yesterday.  It will stand on the bluff tract and will be just a little north and east of the handsome Horticultural building.  The dimensions of the building are to be 60x100 feet.  While not very large, the unique design selected will make it most inviting.  The style of architecture is that of a Swiss cottage.  Constructed entirely of Minnesota logs with their bark on, the exterior will present an appearance well calculated to remind one that Minnesota's chief industry lies in its lumber camps.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="47" xml:id="TMISB04-047"/>
                            
                            <p>The building will be two stories in height.  The plan of the first floor shows a large reception room, squarely in the middle, to be fitted up in modern clubhouse style, with all the attendant conveniences.  To the right as one enters the reception hall will be the parlor for women, which will be tastefully furnished.  The men's parlor will be to the left of the reception hall and will be equally inviting.  It will be fitted up as a logging camp and its every detail will suggest life in the timber regions of Minnesota.  On the second floor there will be the offices of the state commission to the exposition, the office of the secretary and the living quarters of the secretary, janitor and other attendants.  Porches will surround the ground floor and balconies the second.</p>
                            <p>Architect MacLeod said to The Bee just before leaving for Minneapolis that work will be commenced on the state building as soon as the final drawings can be completed, which will be at an early date.  He will make a half dozen trips here to supervise the work of construction and a regular superintendent will look after the work for the commission from the start of the building to its completion.</p>
                            <p>At a meeting of the commission recently in St. Paul it was decided that $25,000 will be required to make a creditable exhibit and erect a state building.  After discussing several plans for raising this money it was decided that the quickest way would be to divide the amount to be raised among the several counties of the state according to the assessed valuation of the property in each county.  The counties have been asked to carry out this plan and it is proposed to ask the legislature to reimburse them.  Governor Clough and Lieutenant Governor Gibbs are taking an active interest in the matter of having the state well represented and are urging prompt action.</p>
                            <p>No attempt will be made to have an educational exhibit on account of the short time before the exposition will open, but it is announced that extensive exhibits in all lines of manufacture and agriculture will be made.  The millers of Minneapolis will unite in making a large exhibit of their products.  The State Agricultural society has offered the commission the large forestry exhibit belonging to the society and this will be installed in the state building.</p>
                            <p>The lumbermen, quarrymen and iron mine owners have been asked to contribute the material needed for the construction of the state building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Thousands of Applications from All Sorts and Conditions of Men for Positions on Exposition Police Force.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The question of guards for the exposition is becoming a live issue and is causing Manager Kirkendall all kinds of trouble.  The arrangement of a plan for guards and their appointment is a function of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, and this department has been made the target for applicants from every nook and corner of this broad land.  If there is a square mile of territory within the confines of the United States which has not contributed an aspirant for a position in the Transmississippi guards it is because the spot is uninhabited.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall has thousands of applications from every conceivable class of people.  A number are from army officers of the junior grades who are anxious to take charge of the force.  Others are from civilians who have occupied positions as officers of the guard at other expositions and who are anxious to continue in the business.  Others, again, are from men who are imbued with the idea that they were born to command and they want to practice upon the rank and file of the exposition forces.  These latter usually have some great scheme to suggest and they estimate their monthly salary up in the hundreds.  Applications from all of these sources have been pouring in for the last six months at the rate of forty or fifty per day, and a special file case has been constructed for filing them away.</p>
                            <p>The applications for positions in the ranks of the guards are received by the thousands.  A large proportion of them are from men who have served in the same capacity in former expositions and they seem to like the business.  Hundreds of applications have been received from soldiers in the regular army.  Some of them say their time of enlistment will expire some time before June 1, and others say they can get leave of absence during the exposition.  Large numbers have also been received from men holding positions as guards in penitentiaries.  These men argue that their experience makes them familiar with criminals and, hence, they would be able to render valuable service.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">COLLEGE BOYS ARE ANXIOUS.</head>
                            <p>By far the largest proportion of the applications, however, come from young men who are attending college in various parts of the country.  These men are anxious to repeat the experience of many of their fellows at the World's fair and rub up against the world while absorbing information in large quantities by this contact and by what may be seen about the exposition grounds.  The item of salary cuts very little figure with this class of applicants, few of them making any mention of the feature which seems uppermost in the minds of most of the other applicants.  When the question of salary is touched upon by the college men, however, the figures quoted are invariably low, in some instances reaching the sum of $15 per month.  Out of this sum they agree to provide such uniform as may be required and board themselves.</p>
                            <p>An application has been received from the battalion of cadets at the University of Nebraska, which contemplates furnishing as many guards as may be required.  This is a pet project of Chancellor MacLean's, who is especially anxious to have his "boys" given this opportunity for acquiring experience with the world and information at the same time.  He has appeared before the executive committee to urge that the guards be selected from among the cadets, urging as reasons for such action that the boys represent the entire middle west, there being students from nearly every portion of Nebraska and the adjoining states, and he also argues that the complete discipline of the cadets and their neat uniforms would make them most desirable in every respect, while their familiarity with the usages of polite society would enable them to act as guides and dispensers of information in a manner which would reflect credit upon the exposition management.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall has taken all these applications and arguments under consideration, and has been revolving in his mind a plan for settling the matter, but he says he has not yet reached a point where he is prepared to make any announcement of what he will do, although he will take decisive action within a short time.  He will recommend the employment of about seventy-five men at first, and this force may have to be doubled as the crowds increase.  The guards will be quartered on the grounds in a portion of the Service building, to be erected on Twentieth street, just north of the Administration arch, and will be required to be on the grounds at all times.  Their tours of duty will be arranged in convenient shifts, but the entire force will be available at any time.  The guards will be required to do police duty and act as guides in giving out information and showing visitors about the grounds.</p>

                            <p>E. B. Pope of St. Louis, state superintendent of schools of Missouri, is in the city as the guest of Superintendent Pearse of the Omaha schools.  He visited exposition headquarters and the exposition grounds in company with Mr. Pearse, and was greatly interested in looking at the space which has been reserved for Missouri.  When he learned that his state had reserved about 900 feet in the Liberal Arts building for an educational exhibit Mr. Pope declared that this space must be increased to at least 2,000 feet, as he intended to have an excellent educational display and could not possibly confine it to 900 feet.  He said he would take this matter up with the Missouri commission as soon as he reached home and have the space increased.  Mr. Pope stated that the Missouri exhibit, in the educational line, would include all lines of work, but would be especially strong in the kindergarten department.  He said the schools were making elaborate preparations for the occasion and would make a fine showing.</p>

In closing, Mr. Crawford says: "I can assure you that the attendance will be large and I hope that we shall be able to make it the largest convention in the history of the league."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Conference Held to Consider Details of the Project.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, March 13.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;An important conference, participated in by Mr. Rosewater, chairman of the Bureau of Publicity and Promotion; Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs Tonner, Major Larrabee, in charge of the executive branch of the bureau, and Major Powell, chief of the Bureau of Ethnology, was held this afternoon upon the proposed Indian congress at the Omaha exposition.  Major Powell, who is greatly interested in the scope of the congress, is of the opinion that better results could be obtained if the groups of Indians were made up from the principal tribes, and that these groups would represent the whole life of that people, their tribal customs and their religious exercises and festivals, as well as their peculiar skill and workmanship under primitive conditions, included within.  Mr. Tonner brought out the fact that the appropriation of $45,000 would have to include the cost of subsistence and some material which the Indians would need in the construction of villages and manufacture.  With an assurance from the railroads that transportation charges of the Indians would be nominal, their number could be materially increased.  Estimates of subsistence expense will be left to Captain W. H. Mercer of the Omaha agency, who will have general supervision of the Indian encampment.  Captain Mercer is expected here this week.  It was agreed between Major Powell and the representatives of the Indian bureau that there should be hearty co-operation in organizing and selecting groups and exhibits to accompany them.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater also had a conference with Director of the Mint Roberts as to the representation of the mints at Omaha, medals and souvenirs.  Final arrangements will be perfected at Philadelphia tomorrow by Managers Lindsey and Rosewater for the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COMMISSIONER ARRANGES FOR SPACE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Henry E. Dosch of Portland Makes All Necessary Arrangements with the Managers and Tells of His Plans.</head>
                            <p>That Oregon is to be represented in a creditable and extensive manner at the exposition is assured beyond doubt.  Henry E. Dosch of Portland, a member of the state commission recently appointed by the governor, is in Omaha with full plenipotentiary powers and he has decided that the state must be represented.  After conferring with the exposition authorities he has reserved 8,000 feet of space in the several buildings for Oregon's exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dosch will have full charge of the exhibit to be made by his state.  He acted in the same capacity during the World's fair and when he was appointed a member of the Oregon commission recently he was selected as a committee of one to come to Omaha and determine whether the state should make an exhibit or remain out entirely.  Before he had been in town twelve hours Mr. Dosch decided that Oregon must be represented.</p>
                            <p>"We will raise $20,000 for our exhibit," said Mr. Dosch positively.  "I know where this amount can be obtained with very little effort on the certificate plan, the money to be refunded by the legislature.  I will return home as soon as I have completed arrangements for our space and take up at once the work of preparing for our display.  We will show minerals, lumber, agricultural and horticultural products, fish and probably a number of entries in fine arts.  We will not undertake to erect a state building, as the time is now too short to carry out such a project in the manner we would desire, but by utilizing the mineral and forestry collections now in hand we will have an exhibit that will be a credit to our state and will compare favorably with that of any of the other states."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dosch is a retired capitalist and his work in the matter in hand is one of philanthropy.  Reports from Oregon are to the effect that he earned the confidence of the people by the manner in which he conducted the exhibit at the World's fair, returning $18,000 to the state treasury as a balance from an appropriation of $60,000.</p>
                            <p>The 8,000 feet of space reserved by Mr. Dosch for Oregon is divided as follows:  Mines building, 2,000 feet; forestry exhibit, 2,000; Horticulture building, 1,500; educational exhibit, 1,000 feet; Agricultural building, 1,000; fish exhibit, 500 feet.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Miss Butterfield Very Successful in Her Quest for Exhibits.</head>
                            <p>Miss Mellona Butterfield, superintendent of the art department of the Nebraska exposition commission, and the hostess of the Nebraska building, is making good progress in the work of collecting paintings and other works of art from the studios of Nebraska artists, which will be used in decorating the and beautifying the interior of Nebraska's handsome building.  She has made a number of trips to the principal towns of the state and has been in communication with a number of well known Nebraska artists who are now living in other states.  By this means she has secured a number of works which she says are of the most desirable quality and will stand comparison with the work which may be produced by any other state.  Among the works already secured are these:  Paintings by Miss Parker, art instructor of the University of Nebraska; paintings by Mrs. Paul Holm and Mrs. McKnight of Lincoln, ceramics by Mrs. Brock of Lincoln, paintings by Miss Almira Graves of Arborville, the winner of a medal in painting at Brownell hall; paintings by Miss Ethel Milestone, formerly of Omaha, now of Boston; paintings by Miss Leta Hornlacker, formerly of Hastings, now of New York; same from H. H. Bagg, art instructor at the Peru Normal school; Mrs. Tannie McLennan Hinman, formerly of Omaha, now of Chicago, will contribute paintings; Mrs. Emma Homan Thayer of Denver has promised to contribute one or two paintings; Miss Tanie Snowden and Albert Rothery of Omaha will also contribute paintings.</p>
                            <p>Miss Butterfield says the building will be tastefully and prettily decorated in a manner which will make it as attractive as possible.  She has secured possession of the beautiful mantel which the women of Nebraska contributed to the decoration of the Nebraska building at the World's fair, and this will be installed in the building.  This mantel is now at Pawnee City.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Major Clarkson on a Special Mission Among the Jayhawkers.</head>
                            <p>Major T. S. Clarkson is in Kansas arousing an interest among the people of that state in the idea of having an exhibit at the exposition.  Several formal attempts have been made in this direction by numerous agents, but nothing has come of them.  The major reports that he has addressed a large meeting of business men at Atchison and received a very cordial reception, the people manifesting an interest in the exposition matter and issuing a call for a general meeting of citizens to be held Thursday evening.  Action was also taken to urge the governor to appoint a strong commission to begin active work.  From Atchison Major Clarkson wrote that he would go to Leavenworth and Topeka and would have a personal interview with the governor to urge him to take hold of the matter before it is too late.  The major also said that he would organize a party of prominent business men from Leavenworth, Atchison and Topeka to visit Omaha and acquire a little enthusiasm.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the apparent apathy of the state at large, some of the counties of Kansas are taking the matter in their own hands and are making preparations to make county exhibits at the exposition, regardless of what the state may do.  Washington county has made an appropriation for an exhibit and has sent a committee, consisting of Messrs. Scofield, Morrow and Vincent, to Omaha to make arrangements for space, etc.  This committee is in the city and will confer with the exposition officials regarding the matter.</p>

The executive committee of the Associated Board of Trade held a special meeting recently and a resolution was adopted which was introduced by the representative of the New England Shoe and Leather association, urging upon the governor the importance of having the state well represented at the exposition.  Mr. Bickford says this organization is composed of representatives of twenty-six of the commercial bodies of Boston and is one of the strongest trade organizations in the world.  He says the president and secretary of the organization are most favorable to participation by the state and will urge the governor to take action.  The project of a state building is making good progress and every indication is in favor of the Old Bay state being at the exposition in full force.</p>

He says a meeting of the commission will be held at the state capitol very soon to organize for business and expresses the opinion that the state will make a strong showing.  Mr. Wadley was connected with the Nashville exposition and is personally acquainted with many of the commission.  He believes that influence can be brought to bear to induce the Tennessee commission to erect a state building on the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WIGWAM TO BE BUILT IN APRIL.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Committee Decides on the Construction of the Proposed Building.</head>
                            <p>The wigwam committee of the Transmississippi association is busily engaged in making arrangements for the beginning of the work of constructing the building.  The report that will be submitted by the committee at the next meeting of the association will show that all the arrangements for active work of building have been completed and the purchase of material and engagement of workmen will be the next thing for consideration.  The sentiment of members of the building committee and also of the association is against beginning the actual work of construction until about the middle of April.  Until then work cannot be done to as good advantage on account of the weather.  It is believed that the building can be erected and finished inside of a month from the time the start is made, which will give two weeks for the preparation of the exhibits and their installation.  It has been definitely decided that the work will not be let to contractors, but will all be done under the supervision of the association, most likely directly under the watchful eye of President A. C. Graham who is especially well fitted for the place and will do the work of superintending free of charge.  One skilled builder will be given direct charge of the men and will lay out their work for them and will see to it that the plans of the architects are followed and all work properly done.</p>
                            <p>Another thing is also assured and that is that none but Council Bluffs men and material will be used from the start to the finish.  This sentiment was evidenced by the approval of a resolution that was introduced at the last meeting by Mayor Carson, which declared:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Ample funds have been secured for the beginning of actual work of construction of the wigwam, therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the building committee of the association is hereby directed to proceed at once with the construction of the foundation and the first story of the building.  That the committee is hereby instructed to construct said wigwam of material furnished by Council Bluffs people and that the superintending architects, foremen and mechanics be employed from the citizens of Council Bluffs.  That all employes be paid the customary wages and contract to permit a discount of 5 to 10 per cent from their wages, to be applied toward the construction fund.  That the Council Bluffs dealers be requested to furnish all material at wholesale rates and given a discount of 10 per cent to the building fund.</p>
                            <p>The resolution passed in a modified form, but all of the sentiments it expressed were approved.  Many mechanics who have been consulted have expressed a willingness to contribute the percentage of their wages suggested in view of the fact that the work will be done in the beginning of the season.  Wholesale dealers also express a willingness to furnish material at wholesale rates.  The committee of fifty responsible for the undertaking are all busy business men, who have been contributing their time to the enterprise, and in addition each has paid his $10 assessment, and a number of them have given double the amount agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>There is no question but that the wigwam will be built in ample time for the arrangement of the exhibits before the opening of the exposition or that it will be the imposing structure that was at first planned.</p>

                            <p>Whereas, Space has been granted on the Transmississippi and International Exposition grounds for the reproduction of the McKinley and Bryan homesteads and the privilege has been given to exhibit therein certain manufactured articles and souvenirs; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, These privileges are liable to create political contention and strife which would not be in harmony with the great purposes of this exposition and which was not contemplated by the executive committee when these privileges were granted; therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, by this committee, That its action in granting space for these buildings and the privilege of exhibiting therein be and is hereby rescinded and that the secretary be instructed to notify the applicants in both cases of this action.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield laid before the committee a letter from President W. H. Bell of the Central Labor Union, which was ordered filed with a number of similar communications on the same subject, to be taken up at the proper time.  The body of the letter was as follows:</p>
                            <p>I am instructed to notify you and through you the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition of a resolution unanimously adopted by the Central Labor Union, declaring organized labor's unalterable opposition to the closing of the exposition gates on Sunday.</p>

The name of this organization does not throw much light on the nature of the communication unless the reader is well versed in American history, but it may be stated that Elizabeth Ross, or "Betsy" Ross as she was generally known, was the designer and maker of the American flag as we now know it.  The association bearing her name was organized for the purpose of erecting a monument to this noted character in history and the secretary of the association suggests that a "flag day" be made a feature of the program of the exposition and that appropriate exercises be held on that occasion.  It is suggested that the town and exposition grounds should be buried in an avalanche of red, white and blue, and noted men from all sections of the country should be invited to participate in the program.  The date suggested for this celebration is June 14, the anniversary of the adoption of the American flag.  In case this suggestion is adopted the secretary writes that the association will make arrangements to exhibit the first American flag made by Betsy Ross and other relics of interest in the same connection.</p>
                            <p>The matter will be given prompt attention by President Wattles.</p>

                            <p>Colonel H. B. Maxson of Reno, vice president of the exposition for Nevada, is breaking the record for exploiting the exposition in his territory.  Every newspaper in the state is printing display advertisements, editorials and columns of reading matter at the request of the vice president, calling upon the people of every section to render all the assistance in their power and send exhibits to the point designated by Colonel Maxson.  The colonel reports that great interest is being shown in all sections of the state, especially the eastern portion and a fine exhibit is assured.</p>

                            <p>Vice President Sutherlin of Montana has increased the space for the Montana exhibit in the Mines building and now has 3,300 feet reserved.  He also reserved 400 feet in the Horticulture building and 1,000 feet in the Liberal Arts building.  The latter will be used for an educational exhibit which will be made by the Montana university.  The contract for the Montana building has been let to Leo Bonet, the cost to be $8,000.  The building will stand on the west side of the bluff tract, opposite Emmet street, being just west of the space reserved for the Iowa building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Oregon Commissioner Enthusiastic Over the Exposition.</head>
                           <p>Mr. Henry Dosch of Portland, Ore., the representative of the Oregon Exposition commission, is still in the city, and his enthusiasm in the exposition is increasing with every hour of his stay.  He is greatly pleased with the location secured for the Oregon building, being a pleasant site on the west side of the bluff tract, midway between Emmet and Lothrop streets.  He says the Oregon building will be a rival of the Georgia Pine Palace and will be constructed with "hard oil finish" on the outside, while the interior will be elaborately decorated with every variety of wood that grows in Oregon.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bosch learned that the people of Aroostock county, Maine, have applied for space in which to exhibit about seventy-five or 100 varieties of potatoes grown in that county, which make a specialty of growing the tubers.  "We will beat them all to pieces on potatoes," exclaimed Mr. Dosch.  "At the World's fair we showed 265 varieties of potatoes, all grown in Oregon, and I guess if we set out to do it we could find another hundred or two.  We are going to make a showing that will open the eyes of eastern people and make them think, what is a fact, that Oregon is the best substitute for Paradise that can be found in this world."</p>
                            <p>After visiting the exposition grounds yesterday afternoon Mr. Dosch, the Oregon commissioner, was very enthusiastic regarding the participation of his state in the exposition and declared most emphatically that he would urge his people to erect a state building on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>"I am going to recommend and insist that we put up a building to be used as headquarters on the grounds," said Mr. Dosch.  "We can build it of wood, inside and outside, and make a structure which will be very attractive besides being a splendid advertisement for our lumber resources.  In addition to the $20,000 which will be required for an exhibit we will require about $5,000 for our building and I believe we can raise the entire amount without any difficulty."</p>
                            <p>"I can hardly express my surprise at the beauty and grandeur of your exposition," continued Mr. Dosch.  "I expected to see a good showing but I was surprised beyond measure at the magnitude and magnificence of the grounds and buildings.  Your buildings are beautiful and the arrangement of the grounds are all that could be desired, but I am a horticultural crank and I am convinced that your Horticulture building is entirely too small.  Why!  I could fill one quarter of it with a display from our state.  We raise everything in the fruit line except citrous fruits and we have a reputation to sustain.  We took all the medals on apples, grapes and cherries at the World's fair and we will make a big showing in all kinds of fruits this summer.</p>
                            <p>"I am especially anxious to have our state represented by a headquarters building.  After seeing the fine locations you have for state buildings and the great showing which is being made by other states in that direction I want our state to be in line and I believe it can be accomplished without difficulty.  I think our big lumbermen will donate the wood and we will have as fine a building as there will be on the bluff tract.  My plan is to have a building about 40x60 feet on the ground, two stories high and fitted with rooms for offices and parlors for our people.  A veranda twenty feet in width should surround the whole building for shade and then we would have a place where our people could make their headquarters when they come to the exposition.  I am going to turn my attention to this matter when I reach home and I believe it can be brought about."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Director Kelly Announces that Lists Will Close Next Week.</head>
                            <p>The regular weekly meeting of the Exposition chorus was held last night in the large room on the top floor of the city hall.  This was the first meeting in these quarters and the change was a most agreeable one.  The high ceiling and large area of this room made the work of the chorus much more satisfactory and the effect was noticeable in the results produced.  Charles Gounod's beautiful work, "By Babylon's Wave," was the first thing taken up and the drill on this rather difficult number was productive of excellent results.  The "Easter Hymn" from Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," was also put in rehearsal and good progress was made on it.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Edward Dworzak has been appointed accompanist for the chorus and assumed charge of the piano last night.  The careful and conscientious manner in which he performed this thankless task was a great assistance to the singers.</p>
                            <p>Director Kelly announced that at all rehearsals hereafter no one not a member of the chorus will be allowed to sing and no persons will be admitted to the rehearsal except the members of the chorus or those acting as escorts for the female members.  He also announced that the lists will be closed at the next meeting and no further members will be admitted.</p>
                            <p>The membership of the chorus has increased at each meeting, about a dozen new voices being added last night and the maximum number of 200 has been almost reached.</p>

                            <p>The making of macadam roadways on the bluff tract is making rapid progress.  The frost is entirely out of the ground and the big twelve-ton steam road roller packs the earth in the roadway until it is firm and the same process is followed with the four inches of broken stone and the inch and one-half of gravel which is used for a top dressing.  By the end of next week the walks and drives on the bluff tract will have been entirely finished.</p>
                            <p>The brick selected for the walks in the main court are pressed brick of a dark cream color, made in Omaha.  They will be laid in three inches of sand and the greatest care will be taken to make walks of exceptional excellence.  This work is in progress, but the ground in the main court is not entirely free from frost and moisture and the work is proceeding rather slowly.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee, Park Commission and Women's Board Press the County Representatives to Reconsider Action.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The members of the exposition executive committee, each and every member of the executive committee of the Woman's Board of Managers and members of the Board of Park Commissioners are expressing the greatest disappointment at the announcement that the Board of County Commissioners will refuse to co-operate with the exposition management and the park board in securing for the decoration of the exposition and as a bequest to the public parks the lot of permanent statuary which the exposition desires to purchase from Captain Edward Kemeys, the well known sculptor of Indians and wild animals.  The proposition as made by Captain Kemeys, through a representative who has been on the ground for some time, is to design an original group, in the size known as semi-heroic, showing an half-naked Indian astride his pony in the act of administering the death blow to a buffalo.  In addition to this he proposes to furnish eight single figures of wild animals, life size, the exposition management to have the right to select the animals, the only provision being that they shall be of a distinctively western type.  All of these figures are to be of cement on an iron frame, the material being treated by a patented process which is guaranteed to make it permanent in its character.  For this work the sculptor asks $15,000 and the exposition management asked the park board and the county commissioners to co-operate with it, each contributing $5,000 toward the purchase, with the provision that the statuary is to become the property of the city after the exposition for the decoration of the city parks.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles of the exposition and Park Commissioner H. E. Palmer were discussing the status of this matter in the office of the former and both expressed the greatest regret at the report that the county commissioners would refuse to co-operate in the matter.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MOST REASONABLE PROPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>"If the county refuses to act with the exposition and park board in this matter," said President Wattles, "it means that the exposition grounds will not be embellished with any statuary.  We have been trying to devise ways and means for securing some kind of statuary ever since the exposition was started and have been unable to see any way to do it, but this proposition promised to put an end to our troubles in that line.  We have been investigating the statuary question for some time and have learned enough about it to know that this proposition is a most reasonable one and to the advantage of the exposition to accept, but we have not seen our way clear to devote $15,000 to that purpose.  After going to great expense to erect beautiful buildings and laying out magnificent grounds, if we do not have statuary to add the finishing touch it will be like giving a man a fine suit of clothes and sending him out in the street without any hat.  Statuary is absolutely essential to the carrying out of our plans, but we have not the money to pay for it.  We have asked the park board and the county to help us out of this dilemma and we feel justified in saying that this proposition is the best that we can expect to receive."</p>
                            <p>"I feel very much disappointed about the matter," said Captain Palmer.  "The board was well satisfied with the proposition and we are especially anxious to secure the Indian and buffalo for Jefferson square.  We believe it will be the handsomest and best ornament for that park that could possibly be secured and would soon become a landmark.  I hope the commissioners will not pass the resolution that has been introduced, but will help us to get this statuary for our parks.</p>

                            <p>"Statuary is a thing you can't put a fixed value on," continued the captain.  "Kemeys is one of the most celebrated sculptors of wild animals and Indians in the country and what could be more appropriate than a statue of an Indian and buffalo in Omaha, the recognized center of the Indian country in the olden days.  The only question our board has had in the matter has been the permanency of this material, but I am informed that there are statues in Europe made of the same material which have been in existence hundreds of years, and a recent issue of one of the principal scientific papers published in this country contained an article regarding a gigantic statue of this kind which was erected about 300 years ago and which is still standing.  If it lasts as long as that I believe we will get out money's worth."</p>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Woman's board spent considerable time at its regular weekly meeting discussing this statuary question.  They had a material interest in the matter, as this committee first agitated the matter of securing several pieces of statuary for the exposition grounds with a view of having them placed in the parks afterward and the progress of the matter has been watched with a great deal of interest.  After discussing the matter at length the women formulated a letter to the Board of County Commissioners, urging that body to join the exposition management and the Board of Park Commissioners in purchasing the statuary and giving several reasons why this should be done.  Among the reasons were these:  "We consider the present an unusual opportunity for securing such valuable and permanent decoration.  The far-reaching educational value, both as an exhibit of high art for the exposition and as a perpetual legacy to our community we deem of very great importance.  We believe these works of art will be a most fitting souvenir of the great exposition and that the large body of intelligent citizens will commend the wisdom and generosity of the men who provided them; and that the appreciation of all classes of reflect honor upon those who secured them."</p>
                            <p>This letter was signed by each individual member of the executive committee and transmitted to the county commissioners.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Leavenworth Citizens Seeing What is Prepared for the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>A strong delegation of Leavenworth business <choice><sic>me</sic><corr>men</corr></choice> accompanied Major T. S. Clarkson of the exposition executive department on his return from a trip to Kansas to arouse the interest of the people of that state in the matter of state representation at the exposition.  The committee consisted of Mayor John D. Edmond, Edward E. Coombs, general manager of the Leavenworth Street Railway company; E. G. Krezdorn, former county attorney; Louis Latte, editor of the Leavenworth Tribune, and George P. Rothschild, a prominent merchant of Leavenworth.</p>
                            <p>The party was escorted to the exposition grounds by Major Clarkson, and then went to the Millard hotel for luncheon, after which the various exposition officers were visited and a large amount of information acquired regarding the exposition.  The visitors, with the exception of Mr. Coombs, returned home this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The visit to the grounds was a great surprise to the Leavenworth delegation.  Mayor Edmond spoke for the committee, saying:  "We expected to see something fine, after hearing Major Clarkson talk so much about it, but we were simply overwhelmed by the preparations which are being made.  We will stir our people vigorously when we return and there is no doubt but Kansas will be well represented by exhibits, and all of our people will visit Omaha during the summer."</p>
                            <p>Major Clarkson reports that this mission was very successful.  He had a long interview with Governor Leedy and the latter agreed to do all in his power to help the matter along.  He said he would appoint a strong commission at once and would ask the next legislature to reimburse any subscriber who will assist in raising the $15,000 which must be raised to make the $15,000 raised by the railroads available.  Major Clarkson says this latter promise on the part of the governor was all that was necessary to insure the raising of the money and that it will be on hand within a very short time.  The governor has been urged to appoint his commission at once and to call a meeting of that body at Omaha in the near future so that the commissioners may see for themselves whether the exposition is all that it has been represented to be.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Beautiful Feature of the Bluff Tract Being Arranged.</head>
                            <p>Henry A. Dreer of Philadelphia, the leading propagator of aquatic plants in this country, is beginning his arrangements for furnishing the aquatic basins, which will be a prominent and very beautiful feature of the floral decoration of the bluff tract.  There will be three of these basins just north of the Horticulture building, directly in the center of the bluff tract.  The middle basin will be eighty feet in diameter, and at the east and west sides will be smaller basins, each twenty-five feet in diameter.  The large basin has been excavated and the planting of this will be commenced at once.  The bottom will be puddled and covered with sand to the depth of several inches.  On this frames will be set and the entire basin will be planted with many varieties of beautiful water lilies.  In a short time the broad green leaves will appear and float on the surface of the water, and about the latter part of June the flowers will begin to appear.  These will present a great variety of colors, and their fragrance will scent the air for a considerable distance on every side.</p>
                            <p>The side basins, however, will be the greatest attraction to lovers of the beautiful.  These basins will be cemented and supplied with heating apparatus to maintain the water at a temperature of 80 degrees at all times.  In each of these basins will be planted one specimen of the beautiful Victoria Regia, one of the finest varieties of water lilies in cultivation.  One plant of this immense variety will fill one of these basins.  Its broad, flat leaves, two or three feet in diameter with upturned edges, float on the water and between the leaves will appear the huge flower, fully a foot in diameter and of surpassing beauty.</p>
                            <p>These "plants" are started in a greenhouse and put in the basin after the weather is sufficiently warm.</p>

                            <head type="sub">What the Exposition Will Offer to the Visiting Guardsmen.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles has commenced active operations toward securing a militia encampment for Omaha during the summer and has completed arrangements by which military organizations desiring to come to the exposition will be provided with accommodations such as their necessities require.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee yesterday the president was authorized to make arrangements to provide suitable camp grounds for such of these organizations as desires to come, a large number of troops from different states having already made inquiry regarding the accommodations which will be furnished by the exposition.  The president recommended that these accommodations be provided:  Camp grounds, lights for the streets in the encampment, water, sanitary conveniences, tents with temporary board floors, provided tents can be secured from the government without cost; straw for tents; one free admission for each member of the organization who accompanies it.</p>
                            <p>These accommodations are <choice><sic>substantialy</sic><corr>substantially</corr></choice> the same as have been provided by former expositions, and it is expected that the inducements thus offered will result in gathering at Omaha a large force of militia.  The only return asked of the troops is that they shall participate in any parades which may occur during their stay.  A proper camping ground will be provided in the neighborhood of the exposition grounds.</p>

The entire matter has been turned over to President Wattles and Chief Redell of the Omaha fire department, and they have made arrangements by which an enclosed space of sufficient size for the exhibitions will be provided.  This space lies north of the Missouri Pacific railway tracks and south of Ames avenue, between Twentieth and Twenty-fourth streets, being now enclosed by the exposition fence.  On this space will

                            be created a suitable building for storing apparatus and other property of the firemen and another building which will be used for exhibition drills and for an actual fire.  Plenty of water will be provided.</p>
                            <p>Chief Redell is most enthusiastic over the possibilities of this tournament.  The last national tournament of firemen was held in Chicago about twenty years ago and was attended by over 25,000 people, there being nearly 15,000 firemen in the parade.  He predicts that on this occasion there will be fully 50,000 people in attendance.</p>
                            <p>A committee will arrange for purses which will be offered for the several contests.  There will be $20,000 offered in prizes.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ideal Place for Base Ball&#8212;Plenty of Room to Line 'Em Out&#8212;Street Cars Run Right to the Gates.</head>
                            <p>The location of the base ball park has been settled at last and anyone who wants to see the Omaha club of 1898 play ball will find it at Twenty-fifth street and Ames avenue.  The lease for these grounds was signed by Manager O'Brien yesterday afternoon and the task of converting the site into a first class ball park will begin at once.  They will be ready for the use of the team in practice by April 1 and the grand stand and other improvements will be completed soon after.</p>
                            <p>The new grounds constitute an ideal base ball site, aside from the fact that they are a little further from the business district than those previously occupied.  Manager O'Brien has waited until as late as possible in the hope of being able to secure the University grounds, but it has been impossible to reconcile the numerous interests involved in that site, and it was finally decided that the Ames avenue grounds were next in point of merit.  The new location will afford the most commodious and naturally adapted park that the city has ever had, and when the improvements are completed the city will have one of the finest ball parks in the country.  The grounds will by 620x675 feet, thus affording ample room for fast fielding and also a commodious quarter stretch for the use of carriages.  Very little grading will be necessary and a very little rolling and scraping will put the grounds in admirable condition.  Manager O'Brien will put a force of men at work at once to build the fence and the other improvements will follow rapidly.</p>
                            <p>While the new grounds are about five minutes' ride further north than the University grounds, they are really almost as easy of access.  The additional riding time is very nearly offset by the fact that both the Sherman Avenue and cross-town lines will deposit patrons right at the gates, while it would be necessary to walk from two to four blocks to reach the University grounds from any of the motor lines.  While the latter was the first choice of the management as well as of most of the patrons of the game it is believed that the new location will be satisfactory.  Everyone who has been out to examine the site is enthusiastic over it and the big park will be most acceptable after seeing the game played in cooped-up grounds for two or three years.  The man who hits the ball over the fence at the Ames avenue park can get $100 of the manager's money and the people who like to see the sharp fielding of long hits will be fully accommodated.  When all the advantages of the location are considered it is not unlikely that the public will be more than pleased with it as soon as it becomes accustomed to the change.</p>
                            <p>President Frank Murphy of the Street Railway company has tacitly assured the management that the Twenty-fourth street line will be extended to Ames avenue and with this improvement the facilities for reaching the grounds will be better than those that are enjoyed by any other city in the league except Detroit.</p>
                            <p>Manager O'Brien is making arrangements to begin the transformation of the grounds at Twenty-fifth street and Ames avenue into a base ball park and before the end of the week a gang of men will be at work building the fence and grading the diamond.  The fence will be built of matched lumber, to the probable consternation of the small boys who cherish happy anticipations of spending sunny afternoons with first one eye and then the other glued to a crack.  The plans for the grand stand will be completed today and this feature of the work will be pushed along with the rest.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Position of Two Divines on the Question Given.</head>
                            <p>Rev. Luther M. Kuhns of Omaha writes to the Lutheran Observer, the organ of the "General Synod" Lutherans, as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Exposition is to be held in Omaha from June to November.  The Ministerial union of Omaha has been exerting itself to secure the closing of the gates of the exposition on Sunday.  A committee of the Ministerial union was appointed to wait upon the directory of the exposition, if possible, to secure this, and another committee was appointed to secure the co-operation of the presbyteries, synod and conferences, and the support of the various young people's organizations in this effort.  The various denominations and young people's societies have endorsed the effort of the Ministerial union to secure Sunday closing.</p>
                            <p>At the last regular monthly meeting of the Ministerial union the committee to wait upon the directorate of the exposition reported that "the executive committee of the exposition directory declines to confer at the present time with the committee in regard to this matter."  Upon recommendation of the committee the Ministerial union declared itself opposed to Sunday opening of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Jewish rabbi and the Unitarian minister of this city have expressed themselves as favorable to Sunday opening.  Besides these, the following letter from the pastor of one of the Missouri Lutheran churches of the city will be of sad interest to General Synod Lutherans:</p>
                            <p>(Here follows the letter of Rev. J. S. Her, commenting on the sermon of Rev. Howard McAyeal, published in The Bee of February 7.)</p>
                            <p>Commenting on the above the Lutheran Witness, organ of the "Missouri" Lutherans, has the following to say:</p>
                            <p>Above communication has furnished the editor of the Lutheran Observer the material for an editorial on "Sabbath Desecration."  We submit, in all kindness, (1) that Rev. Her is far from teaching, or inviting, the desecration of the Christian Sunday; for he himself states reasons why the closing of the exposition to be held at Omaha next summer might be desirable.  (2) Rev. Her appeals to scripture and confession; with scripture and confession he should be met.  (3) Rev. Her places himself on the sound basis of a well known scriptural and political principle, that of the separation of church and state.  It should be shown that this principle does not apply in the case in question.  Expressions of grief and pious exclamations will avail nothing with a conscience bound by the word.  Rev. Her makes the impression of a conscientious person.  We have always found that such persons can be easily brought to see an error and acknowledge it.  Truly, after the Observer has gone so far in the matter, Rev. Her would seem entitled to further consideration.  Will the Observer undertake the argument against the position of Rev. Her?</p>

                            <p>There is some prospect that the matter of providing reduced rates for the Transmississippi Exposition will soon be taken up by the general passenger agents of western lines.  The matter is now in the hands of a sub-committee of passenger agents of local lines.  The general committee met about four months ago to discuss the work of securing reduced rates for the exposition.  The matter was at that time referred to a subcommittee, consisting of E. L. Lomax, general passenger agent of the Union Pacific, and John Francis, general passenger agent of the B. &amp; M.  The sub-committee has not yet made its report to the general committee.</p>
                            <p>The other lines in the Western Passenger association, as well as the passenger associations in other parts of the country, are waiting for the local committee to make its report before taking any action in the matter.  At a recent meeting of western lines in Chicago it was agreed that whatever rates should be recommended by the general passenger agents of the lines entering this city should be accepted and participated in by the other lines.  A little over two months will intervene before the opening of the exposition.  The World's fair did not secure the advantages of cheap rates to Chicago until the fair was well advanced.  This was due to the tardiness of lines there agreeing on reduced rates.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Will Not Vote to Assist the Park Board in Acquiring Permanent Groups for the Exposition and Parks.</head>
                            <p>There is nothing to indicate that the members of the Board of County Commissioners will change their minds and vote to appropriate the sum of $5,000 to be used in the purchase of nine pieces of statuary for the exposition grounds.  While they have not formally rejected the request, they have offered a resolution, which has been referred to the committee of the whole for consideration.  This resolution is in the nature of a rejection, and if its adoption is rejected by the committee, the whole matter will thus be disposed of.</p>
                            <p>"In the interest of economy," said Commissioner Ostrom, "I don't see how we can appropriate the sum of $5,000, or any other amount, to buy statuary to be placed on the exposition grounds.  Aside from the question of costs, there are several other reasons why we should not vote $5,000 to assist in buying these figures.  In the first place, they are purely park attractions, and if the members of the Board of Park Commissioners want them, let them pay for them out of their funds.  We have quite an amount of exposition money on hand, but we are going to need about all of it in preparing our county exhibit and maintaining it during the exposition.  After the fruit and vegetable season opens, we will have to replace the exhibits at least once each week.  This cannot be done for nothing.  In addition to this, we have got to help in maintaining police regulations on the ground by paying our proportion of the salary of the guards.</p>
                            <p>"If the exposition people are so anxious for the statuary, as it has been intimated that they are, why don't they appropriate $10,000 and let us pay an <choice><sic>aditional</sic><corr>additional</corr></choice> $5,000 for the maintenance of the big show?  I don't think that I shall vote to appropriate money for statuary."</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the proposition to buy statuary, Commissioner Harte said:  "It is too much money.  They are making figures and groups of figures for the purpose of ornamenting the buildings on the exposition grounds, and they are not paying anything like what is asked for these nine pieces that it is proposed to sell us.  If the price was anything within reason, I might vote for an appropriation.  At this time I can't see how I can agree to put one-third of $15,000 into nine pieces of cement.  It's too much money."</p>
                            <p>Chairman Kierstead said:  "Unless I change my mind, and at this time I can't see any reason for so doing, I shall vote against the proposition to buy this statuary.  I want to be liberal, but I don't think that we should pay any man the profit that this party who makes the statuary wants."</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Hofeldt said:  "Statuary is pretty and it is attractive, but I don't see how I can be a party to paying $15,000 for nine pieces that can be made in a month and at a cost of not more than $500."</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Hocter said:  "We are willing to help the exposition with all of the proceeds of the $100,000 of bonds, but we want to put the money where it will do the most good.  We want to advertise the state and the county and I think that the best way to do so is to make an exhibit of the resources of this locality.  If we can have more money than we need, we can turn it over to be used in helping to pay the actual expenses of the exposition.  If the exposition management wants the statuary, why don't it go on and buy it.  It has done so in other instances."</p>

                            <p>One of the prominent features of the statuary display in the Art building will be a full size copy of one of the most famous statues in existence, the Winged Victory of Samothrace.  The French commissioner for the exposition, Frederick Mayer of Paris, notifies the exposition authorities that he has secured a special concession from the French government which will allow a copy of this famous work to be made for the exposition, and he reported that the figure could be made for 1,175 francs.  The matter was laid before the executive committee and Manager Bruce was authorized to accept the proposition.  He cabled Mr. Mayer to close the bargain and ship the statue as soon as possible.  Chairman Paul Charlton of the art committee hopes to make arrangements to keep this very desirable work of art in Omaha after the exposition closes, but one offer has already been made by a museum in another city to take the state for $200, and the contest promises to develop some sharp competition.</p>

                            <p>The Winged Victory is one of the most famous ancient statues which has ever been discovered.  It was unearthed in the valley of Samothrace in 1867 by a representative of the French government.  It was in fragments and was removed to the Louvre and put together.  About eight years later the gigantic pedestal was discovered and this was also removed to the Louvre, where pedestal and figure were restored to their original positions as far as possible.  The pedestal represents the stony prow of a galley, below which sea waves are represented by sculpture.  The colossal figure, more than double life size, towers above this massive and lofty hulk.  The statue is badly mutilated, but it shows a fully draped female figure which has alighted on the prow of a ship, sweeping down with lightning speed, the powerful form, with rushing drapery, seeming to force a way for this imposing goddess of victory.  The dainty wings of the goddess are extended and might and power are delineated in every line of the figure and drapery.  The figure is of Parian marble, and the exquisite nicety with which every detail is worked out marks this as one of the most remarkable examples of the great genius of the Hellenic sculptors which has ever been discovered.  Careful calculations by antiquarians places the origin of this figure in the third century, B. C.</p>

The Oregon exhibit, according to Mr. Dosch of Portland, who was here early in the week, will include one "stick" sixty feet in length and five feet square, intended to show the size of the lumber obtainable in that prolific section of the universe.  To accommodate such large exhibits will require a great deal of open space and this can only be obtained in the building referred to.  There are a number of applications from other states which desire to make forestry exhibits and these will all be placed in this same building.</p>

                            <p>The announcement that the special exposition postage stamps will be issued about May 15 is a source of great gratification to the exposition management and especially to the Department of Publicity and Promotion.

                            <head type="sub">ORDER TO BE ISSUED IN NEAR FUTURE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Soldiers in Department of the Missouri to Rendezvous in Nebraska's Metropolis the Coming Summer.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, March 18.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Today it was given out at the War department that Adjutant General Corbin would shortly issue an order directing the troops in the Department of the Missouri, formerly the Department of the Platte, to rendezvous at Omaha during the summer.  This order will bring to the Gate City thousands of people in addition to the soldiers and will prove one of the drawing cards of the exposition.  Mr. Rosewater has been especially interested in this cantonment and as the Department of the Missouri includes some of the crack government troops, their assemblage at Omaha will be appreciated by all lovers of the army.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion of the Omaha Exposition was greatly elated today on account of the great amount of work he had accomplished while but a day in Washington, having arrived from New York this morning.  Everything is working splendidly in behalf of the Indian congress project.  He held a conference with Captain W. H. Mercer, agent of the Omaha and Winnebago Indians, who will have charge of the encampment; Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs Tonner and Colonel Larrabee, and ascertained that the Indian department was actively at work arranging details for this great ethnological event.  Secretary Bliss of the Interior department was also seen and while emphatically stating that the amount expended would have to be within the appropriation, he went so far as to say the department would issue rations to those Indians who would be entitled to rations on the reservation.  This concession was greatly appreciated, as the decision will permit of many more Indians.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater also secured an immense concession from the Navy department, in that it has agreed to permit the Marine band to go to Omaha, providing proper inducements are made to the men.  The Fort Omaha military reservation will be turned over to the Omaha Exposition management during the months beginning June and ending November.  The order has heretofore been issued allowing the use of the grounds for the exposition, but within a short time a new proposition will issue directing that the Omaha Exposition authorities take care of the garrison and be allowed the use of the buildings.  A number of persons have been trying to get hold of the buildings for a fair, but Secretary Alger thought it best for the Omaha Exposition to have the use of the buildings and the order will issue at once.  It is expected that the transmississippi stamps will be issued by May 15.</p>

                            <p>The Bureau of Public Comfort has not yet commenced active operations in the work assigned to it.  An office has been opened on the sixth floor of the Paxton block, but Chairman Dudley Smith says he will not commence active operations until about May 1.  He believes that a great many people will change their residence before that time and that a canvass made now would be of little value for that reason.  About May 1 he says he will put on a force of canvassers and make a house-to-house canvass of the entire city, obtaining all particulars regarding location, name, number of rooms to rent, number of meals which will be furnished, rates and all the other data which will be required to properly inform strangers in the city regarding lodging and board.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime Mr. Smith is compiling a list of the hotels in the city, the number of rooms available, rates, etc., and writing to the officials who had charge of public comfort departments of other expositions regarding the methods pursued by them, with a view to profiting by their experience.</p>

                            <p>John P. Brown of Connersville, Ind., is in the city in the interest of forestry extension in the west.  He is an expert on the planting of trees, and comes to Omaha from Arbor Lodge, Nebraska City, where he has been in consultation with Hon. J. Sterling Morton.  The latter is in cordial sympathy with the plans of the Indiana man, and is going to help him in his efforts to get the great railway systems of the west to do some tree planting in the territory tributary to their lines.</p>
                            <p>At present Mr. Brown is in consultation with General Manager Holdrege of the B. &amp; M. and other Burlington officials on his mission.  He has their assurances of support, and while in the west will make a trip over all the lines of the Burlington west of the Mississippi river to investigate the matter of planting the right trees in the right places.  He also is being backed by Collis P. Huntington, president of the Southern Pacific company, who has promised to help the cause of forestry along the lines of that system.  <choice><sic>MMr.</sic><corr>Mr.</corr></choice> Brown says he is confident that if the railroads and the press of the west take up the mission of those who are trying to secure general tree planting in the west, that this section of the country will soon enjoy the most beneficial effects therefrom.</p>

                            <p>The last number of the American Homeopathist, published at Cleveland, O., contains the following editorial bearing on the meeting of the Homeopathic institute in Omaha:  "We are assured by Dr. W. H. Hanchett and other members of the Omaha committee that no fear need be entertained but that the capacity of the hotels of that city will be ample for all the demands of the institute.  There may be some of our members who have been to Europe a few times but have never been west of the Mississippi river until they went to the institute at Denver and who, therefore, have had the thought that Omaha is a small town on the outskirts of civilization.  A cursory reading of some of the literature which is being issued by the exposition company, after deducting a fair margin for exuberance of spirits, will convince anyone that it is a large city and that the exposition is second only to the World's fair; and that even here, in many details, it surpasses the fair.  At any rate it will be a beautiful picture and one which no good American can afford to miss.  It will be well, however, not to defer engaging rooms until the best rooms are taken.  It costs but a postal card."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Omaha to See a Great Gathering of Regular Soldiers.</head>
                            <head type="sub">WAR DEPARTMENT'S PLEASING ACTION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exposition Authorities Greatly Gratified by the News that a Cantonment of Troops Has Been Ordered.</head>
                            <p>The officials of the exposition are greatly elated over the news from Washington regarding the encampment of the regular troops of the Department of the Missouri at Omaha during the exposition.  This is a matter which has been quietly agitated for some time, and the approval of the War department was all that was required to insure its complete success.  President Wattles has been conducting the negotiations with General Coppinger to bring about this result, and he expresses the great gratification at the success which has been attained.</p>
                            <p>It was for this purpose that application was made to the War department for the control of the old Fort Omaha reservation, the intention being to use this ground for the encampment of troops  The department some time ago gave authority to the exposition to use the land, but reserved the buildings.  The exposition has since been endeavoring to get permission to use the buildings, also, and this will probably be granted.</p>
                            <p>The plans for this cantonment of troops of the Department of the Missouri are not thoroughly worked out, but in conferences between President Wattles and General Coppinger the plan considered has been to bring to Omaha one or two regiments at one time, allowing this force to remain for about two weeks and then ordering another similar detachment to relieve it.  In this way a good-sized force of regulars would be at hand at all times and all the troops of the department be given a short season of camp life.  Each regiment will bring its field equipage with it and make camp on the old fort grounds, where the regulation camp routine will be maintained.  The daily drills and field evolutions of the troops will take place inside the exposition grounds, where a suitable place of sufficient size will be provided for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>The troops in the Department of the Missouri include a number of regiments of cavalry as well as some of the finest infantry regiments of the army, and the attraction afforded by the evolutions of these troops, especially the field drills of the cavalry forces, will undoubtedly prove a very strong drawing card.</p>
                            <p>The effect of this action of the War department on the militia of the surrounding states is expected to be very pronounced.  Arrangements are being made by President Wattles for the use of a section of land in the immediate vicinity of the old fort for the encampment of such militia organizations as may visit Omaha during the exposition.  This land will be provided with many of the necessary requirements for a military camp, including tents with board floors, water, sanitary arrangements, lights and straw for bed ticks.  The advantages to be derived from such a camp in the immediate vicinity of a large camp of regular troops are recognized by the military men as forming a strong inducement, of itself, to the troops of the national guard of neighboring states to come to Omaha for that purpose, aside form the inducements offered by the exposition and many other attractions, and it is expected that the military features of the exposition may yet assume considerable proportions.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent W. R. Jackson of the Educational department of the Nebraska Exposition commission has issued a circular in which are given a number of additional notices to teachers and others interested in the exhibit to be made by the Nebraska schools at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>This circular states that applications for space have now been received from seventy-two of the ninety counties in the state, representing a teaching force of over 2,300.  This includes 322 rural schools, 186 graded or high schools (Omaha, Lincoln, etc., counting as one), eight state institutions, including the schools for defectives, industrial schools and the University of Nebraska; five private normals and business colleges, five denominational schools and the State Chautauqua.</p>
                            <p>The superintendent gives notice that additional space has been secured for the educational exhibit and that the amount now available will allow each teacher to have space for two mounted cardboards, each 22x28 inches.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="53" xml:id="TMISB04-053"/>
                            
                            <p>Teachers are advised to prepare three cardboards, the third to be kept in reserve to replace work which may become soiled.  It is announced that all work must be in the hands of the superintendent by April 20.</p>

                            <p>Chairman John C. Koch of the Wisconsin Exposition commission has been telling the people of Milwaukee about the exposition since his return from his recent visit to Omaha.  In an interview published in one of the Milwaukee papers the former mayor of that city said that the work of preparation is progressing very rapidly and satisfactorily and he had no doubt that everything will be in place and ready by June 1, the date set for the formal opening.  "I was every foot of exhibit space was taken, and that no more space can be contracted for," said Mr. Koch, "and I guess the statement is correct, because while I was there a business friend of mine in the hardware business told me an organization with which he was connected had just given up 75,000 feet of space, owing to some hitch in the work of the intended exhibitors, and in less than twenty-four hours every foot of the surrendered space was taken and contracts signed.  While there we closed contracts for the erection of the Wisconsin building, and it will be completed within six weeks.  The new 'White City' has something of the general appearance of the one at Chicago, though the buildings are, of course, much smaller, but in some instances I think they are handsomer and neater."</p>

                            <p>In response to the call of Major Clarkson about twenty natives of Pennsylvania met at exposition headquarters and formed an organization for the purpose of assisting in the celebration of "Pennsylvania day" at the exposition.  Major Clarkson explained that the governor of Pennsylvania and his suite will visit the exposition some time during the summer and a large number of people will come from that state to visit the exposition, making it desirable to perfect arrangements for properly entertaining the visitors and making them feel that they are among friends.</p>
                            <p>It was stated that there are at least 10,000 Pennsylvanians in Nebraska, some of the counties having permanent organizations.  Burt county, for instance, was reported to have a permanent organization which holds meeting at regular intervals.  A search of the poll books shows that Douglas county has about 800 voters who are natives of Pennsylvania, and it was decided to be desirable to effect an organization to get these people together, the idea being to have all native Pennsylvanians in the state come to Omaha on Pennsylvania day and participate in the enjoyment.</p>
                            <p>With this in view a permanent organization was effected by electing the following officers:  General C. F. Manderson, president; Major T. S. Clarkson, vice president; W. G. Shriver, secretary; H. B. Irey, treasurer.  A committee on by-laws was appointed as follows:  W. G. Shriver, D. B. Houck and W. S. Askwith.  This committee will report at a meeting to be held at exposition headquarters next Saturday at 12:30 p. m.</p>

                            <p>The Missouri Exposition commission is pursuing the same energetic course which has marked its work since the visit of the commission in a body to Omaha to see exactly what was being done and judge what might be expected.  In a recent interview published in a Missouri paper Secretary Carroll said that he felt very confident, from the returns he had received, that Missouri will excel all the other states in the exhibits of horses, mules, cattle, hogs, cotton, corn, wheat, oats, flax, tobacco, fruits and berries, lead, zinc, granite, sandstone, limestone, onyx, lumber, and last, but not least, manufactured articles of many kinds.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Carroll also said that a legal opinion has been obtained in Buchanan county to the effect that county courts have power to make appropriations to aid in local exhibits.  In some counties the courts went ahead weeks ago and made appropriations, but in others they have held back on the claim that they doubted their authority to do so.  The commissioners hope that the ruling in the Buchanan county case will have a good effect on the counties where no help has been secured from the county courts.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, March 19.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Mr. Rosewater had a long talk today with Claude Johnson, in charge of the bureau of printing and engraving, in relation to the exposition stamps.  The chairman saw the designs for the stamps and expressed himself as greatly pleased with their appropriateness and their artistic character.  Mr. Rosewater regretted that there could not have been some distinctive designation on the stamps, but he was shown that neither the Columbian stamps nor those issued for the Centennial were thus marked.  Later he saw Third Assistant Postmaster General Merritt and urged the importance of having the present series of stamps withdrawn from use in order that the Omaha series of stamps may be made valuable to stamp collectors, use being an element of value.  Merritt agreed to take up the subject, and also pledged the department to hasten their preparation.</p>
                            <p>Interior department officials are becoming greatly interested in the forthcoming Indian congress at the Omaha exposition, some of the ablest ethnologists in the country having given a strong endorsement to the idea of grouping the Indians for educational purposes.  Prof. Mooney of the department will probably be assigned to detail work in arranging the convention, his knowledge of Indian tribes and customs being most exhaustive.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Bliss today rendered a second opinion on contests over lands within the limits of the Sioux City and Pacific railroad grant in O'Brien county, Iowa.  The case decided today was that of Schneider against Links, Willer and others.  Schneider purchased the land in controversy form the railroad company in 1883 and in January, 1886, filed notice of his intention to purchase the land in accordance with the notice of the department after the supreme court decision declaring the lands forfeited to the government.  He claimed the land under the act of March 3, 1887, as a purchaser in good faith from the company.  Links, Willer and others made homestead entries for land in February at the time of the opening under departmental instructions.  The local officers decided in favor of Schneider.  This decision was reversed by the land commissioner.  The secretary today overruled the latter and awarded the land to Schneider as an innocent purchaser under the forfeiture act of 1887.  The decision today in favor of the purchaser and the former decision in favor of the settler will determine the disposition of a number of contests, involving about 23,000 acres of lands declared forfeited by the supreme court.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Will Probably Make an Exhibit at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Princeton university will in all probability have an exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition commensurate with its important position in the educational world of this country.  Clement Chase visited the members of the faculty on his recent eastern trip and secured their promise to put in such a display if arrangements for a suitable manager could be made.  This difficulty seems to be overcome by a proposition made by J. T. Downing, a Princetonian now in the city.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Downing has been in the city for several weeks on business, and while here became impressed with the idea that his house should put in an exhibit at the exposition.  He informed the publishers to this effect, and his brother, one of the managers, is now looking over the situation.  Both men are convinced that the Scribners should have a display and the result will probably be that one will be put in.</p>
                            <p>In case that J. T. Downing is installed as manager of this exhibit he is ready and willing to look after the one of Princeton University and has written to the faculty of that institution to that effect.  Princeton had a magnificent exhibit at the World's fair and it is likely that one as good will be installed here.  The grounds and buildings reproduced on a small scale and many historic relics of the revolutionary era of this country were displayed.</p>

                            <p>The women living on Sherman avenue have formed an organization which they have named the Sherman Avenue Decorating club, the purpose of the organization being to improve the appearance of the main street leading to the exposition grounds by painting and otherwise improving the appearance of the houses along the street, beautifying the yards and adding to the beauty of that greatly traveled thoroughfare in many other ways.  Among the schemes which the women have evolved is one for placing a bracket on the side of each telegraph pole, which is toward the street and on each bracket they propose a potted plant.  The telephone company and street railway company will be called on to improve the appearance of their poles by painting them white or by replacing them with more sightly ones.  The Missouri Pacific Railway company will be asked to improve and park the vacant land between its tracks and Sherman avenue, and property owners all along the street will be asked to show why they should not do their portion toward beautifying this street.</p>
                            <p>The officers of this society are:  Mrs. W. Bishop, president;  Mrs. Joseph Houska, treasurer; Mrs. James Redmon, secretary.  The society met at the house of Mrs. Joseph Redmon last night, their coming being a complete surprise to Mrs. Redmon, but the visitors  were pleasantly entertained and an interesting business meeting was held.</p>

                            <p>The statuary for the Administration arch has been completed and has been taken out to the exposition grounds.  These figures were made by Sculptor Walter Mettler at his temporary studio down town.  The main group will be placed over the cornice at the center of the south front of the building.  This group consists of three figures, the central figure being seated on a throne in a watchful attitude, holding in one hand a scepter, being representative of Administration.  At the feet of the central figure are two messengers, one at either side.  The corner pavilions are surmounted by four figures, one at each corner.  These are seated, each holding a flaming torch above the head.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SUCKER STATE PLANS A GREAT EXHIBIT</head>
                            <head type="sub">Clark E. Carr, President of the Commission, Talks of What His People Intend to Do at Omaha.</head>
                            <p>Clark E. Carr of Galesburg, president of the Illinois Exposition commission, Colonel W. H. Harper, chairman of the executive committee, and H. R. Wilson, architect of the Illinois building, are in the city to make arrangements regarding the annex which is to be made to the Illinois building to serve as an art gallery.  In company with T. R. Kimball, architect-in-chief of the exposition, the Illinois delegation visited the grounds and the location of the Illinois annex was agreed upon.  It will be 30x50 feet in size and the same height as the main Illinois building, with which it will be connected by an artistic colonnade.  The annex at once, in order to complete it as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>General Carr was quite enthusiastic regarding the part Illinois will play in the coming exposition and said the state will be represented in the most extensive manner.  The commission has been doing energetic work to arouse interest among the manufacturers and many other interests in the state and President Carr says all of these interests says all of these interests will be represented by large exhibits of a high order.  These matters are being looked after by the commissioners to whom they have been assigned and the indications are very favorable for a fine showing in every department.</p>
                            <p>The mining interests will make a fine showing, in the opinion of General Carr, the large mine owners having been interested in the matter of Judge Wall of DuQuoin.  The breeders of fancy high class live stock will also make fine exhibits.  In this line will be a magnificent showing of blooded cattle by the Illinois Live Stock Breeders' association and breeders of fine strains of sheep and horses are making unusual preparations for an exhibit that shall beat the world.  The horticulturists of the state are greatly interested and a fine showing of all kinds of fruit will be made.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the Illinois building General Carr said it will be very handsomely decorated, the leading houses of Chicago having been asked to make figures on decorating the building.  It is proposed to make the interior present an appearance in keeping with the artistic exterior and liberal use will be made of some of the handsome statuary made for the World's fair.  The annex will be liberally decorated with statuary and paintings, the principal places being occupied by four large paintings of the World's fair by John Key.  A large number of smaller paintings will be hung in the galleries and foyer.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Dominion Government Will Aid in the Exposition Work.</head>
                            <p>British Vice Consul M. A. Hall of this city, who went to Canada as the special representative of the exposition management to induce the Canadian government to reconsider its determination not to make an exhibit at the exposition, has returned and reports that his mission was very successful and that the Canadian exhibit in International hall will be a very creditable showing.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hall visited Ottawa and had interviews with all of the leading officials in the dominion government and with the most influential members of the Dominion parliament.  He encountered very little encouragement at first, the officials politely informing him that the matter had been disposed of and no exhibit would be made, but by dint of personal effort he succeeded in having the subject reopened and an appropriation was made for an exhibit.  The Canadian government will occupy about 4,000 square feet of space in International hall and will make a collective exhibit, showing minerals, agricultural products and manufactured goods.</p>
                            <p>The Canadian Pacific railroad will co-operate with the government.  In this connection, the Canadian Gazette, the official organ of the government, in its issue of March 12, prints the full text of the diplomatic correspondence, carrying with it the invitation of the exposition officials to the queen and her colonies to participate in the exposition.  The invitation of President Wattles, the letter of Minister John Hay transmitting it to the marquis of Salisbury, and the letter of transmittal to the governor general of Canada, are printed in full together with the regulations of the United States Treasury department regulating the entry of foreign exhibits.  This matter occupied three pages of the Gazette and is a formal notice to all the inhabitants of Canada that the government gives its official sanction to the exposition.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles feels greatly elated over the effect a visit to the exposition grounds had upon Dr. W. Seward Webb, president of the Wagner Palace Car company and a member of the New York Exposition commission.  Just prior to the arrival of the sleeping car magnate in this city a letter had been received from him, in which he stated that he could not find the time to give a great deal of attention to the exposition matter and had accepted the appointment as a commissioner with that understanding, but after a visit to the grounds and an inspection of the beautiful buildings, Dr. Webb expressed himself in the very strongest terms to President Wattles, who accompanied him on the trip, and declared in unqualified terms that the exposition was far superior to the World's Fair.  He reiterated his astonishment at the wonders which had been accomplished by western enterprise and declared most emphatically that he would make it his especial business, upon his return to New York, to urge upon Governor Black and upon the legislature of the state the absolute necessity of prompt and liberal action in order to enable the state to be fitly represented.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Webb also said he would see to it that the Wagner Palace Car company makes a fine exhibit of its palace cars by exhibiting a full train of its finest cars equipped with all the modern appliances and comforts.</p>

This committee is also charged with the duty of deciding upon the uses to which the several rooms in the Nebraska building are to be devoted.

                            <head type="sub">Secretary of War Meiklejohn Visits the Exposition Grounds.</head>
                            <p>Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn spent the day in the company of President Wattles and Major Clarkson of the Exposition Executive department, making a trip to the exposition grounds and to the site of old Fort Omaha.  Mr. Meiklejohn expressed the greatest pleasure and surprise at the magnificent showing made by the exposition grounds and it seemed to increase his already strong interest in the progress of the enterprise.  He said the old fort grounds will be turned over to the exposition authorities, together with the buildings on the grounds, excepting the buildings which have been leased to Prof. Gillespie for a school.  These grounds will be utilized as a camp ground for the troops of the Department of Missouri, which will be ordered to Omaha in small detachments of one or two regiments to camp during the exposition.  Mr. Meiklejohn said he would do all in his power to aid in carrying out this plan and expressed the greatest confidence in the success of the movement.  The space inside the exposition grounds which will be used as a drill ground for the troops was pointed out to the secretary and he manifested great interest concerning everything connected with the matter.</p>
                            <p>During this ride Mr. Meiklejohn discussed with President Wattles and Major Clarkson a plan for bringing to the exposition the West Point cadets, the magnificent military organization from the great school maintained by the federal government for the education of young men in the art of war.  The assistant secretary said he had been considering this idea for some time, and intends to lay it before the secretary of war with his recommendation that it be carried out.  The West Point cadets are rarely ordered for duty away from the military academy, and there are very few precedents for the proposed action.  The cadets attended the Centennial exposition at Philadelphia, and were encamped inside the exposition grounds for several weeks, but such instances are very rare, and if the plan of Secretary Meiklejohn is carried out the cadets will prove a strong attraction.  They constitute one of the best drilled military organizations in the world, and their presence at the exposition, in addition to the strong force of regulars, would constitute an attraction seldom seen.  Mr. Meiklejohn expressed a firm conviction the Secretary Alger will approve of this move and the exposition authorities consider it practically settled.</p>

Strehlow, Alexander &amp; Son and W. H. Woerheide.  The last named had a similar contract at the Nashville exposition and is supplied with spraying machines by which the paint is squirted through a rubber hose with a wide, flat nozzle, after the manner in which the buildings at the World's fair were painted.

This is a 6 year-old boy belonging to Miss Campbell's class in the Pacific school, who possesses a remarkable genius for extemporizing fiction.  His performances in that line have become quite famous in local educational circles.  His teacher hands him a picture that he has never seen before and without a second's hesitation the child will weave a story around the characters portrayed in the picture.  He seems to be never at loss for a word or a plot and tells the story as though he was reading it from a book.  His originality is quite as remarkable as his fertility of imagination and he has never been known to repeat himself.  All through the performance he maintains a stoical indifference to his audience, unless some one ventures to laugh, an indignity that he vigorously resents.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mr. Rosewater Interests Senor Romero in the Project.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, March 20.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Mr. Rosewater, with Prof. Mooney of the ethnological bureau, had a conference <choice><sic>wth</sic><corr>with</corr></choice> Senor Romero, Mexican minister to this country, in relation to the forthcoming congress of Indian tribes today.  Mr. Rosewater has conceived the idea of interesting Mexico in the exhibit and if possible secure from that country representatives of the Indian tribes, which are wholly different from those in the United States.  Minister Romero was greatly interested in the project, realizing its educational character and its importance from a practical standpoint.  He desired, however, some formal invitation to his government to participate and should the appropriation for the congress become a law it is the understanding that Senator Allen will introduce a joint resolution calling upon the president to formally invite Canada and Mexico to participate in the Indian congress.</p>
                            <p>While in the city Mr. Rosewater began negotiations with the Marine band to be present at the opening of the exposition and to remain for at least two weeks, providing the consent of Secretary Long can be secured.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater left for New York tonight, where he will join Z. T. Lindsey and together they will leave for the west Monday evening.</p>
                            <p>B. F. White, general attorney for the Elkhorn, is in the city on business with the Interior department in relation to wells along the line of his road used by cattlemen for watering purposes, but found that the matter had been looked after previous to his coming.  He will go to New York tomorrow, thence home.</p>
                            <p>The weighing of mails, upon which the government will make contracts for the next four years, commences on all western roads Tuesday.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SECRETARY MEIKLEJOHN ON SITUATION</head>
                            <head type="sub">No New Developments Which He Feels at Liberty to Disclose&#8212;Plans to Boom the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn, who came to Omaha to attend Mrs. Thurston's funeral, says there are no new developments in the trouble with Spain which he is at liberty to make public and that the report of the board of inquiry is necessary before any action can be taken in the matter.  The appropriation of $2,975,000 made for the coast defense will be used in fortifying vulnerable points and will afford the seaport cities much better protection in case of any trouble.</p>
                            <p>Relative to the moving of the headquarters of the Department of the Missouri, formerly Department of the Platte, Mr. Meiklejohn says that a recommendation was made for the removal to St. Louis.  Kansas City and Leavenworth were also contestants for the location, but the secretary of war considered these cities and decided in favor of Omaha.  His chief reason for this decision was Omaha's advantageous location on transcontinental railroads.  The new division of the army makes the Department of the Missouri much more important than the old Department of the Platte, St. Louis being thrown under this command and the number of men in the department being increased to 2,000.</p>
                            <p>The day that Mr. Meiklejohn left Washington the use of the unleased buildings on the Omaha reservation was granted to the Transmississippi Exposition in addition to the license to use the grounds, which has been already <choice><sic>eexcuted</sic><corr>executed</corr></choice> and delivered.  It is expected that these grounds will be used as a camping place for troops in attendance upon the exposition.  The War department has recommended that the military forces under the command of the Department of the Missouri be permitted to attend the Transmississippi Exposition and in all probability the recommendation of Department Commander General Coppinger will be concurred in in this matter.  In addition to these forces Mr. Meiklejohn says he will leave no stone unturned to secure for the exposition a summer encampment of cadets from the United States Military academy.</p>
                            <p>The effort of Congressman Mercer to secure a visit of newspaper correspondents from all over the United States at the time of the opening of the exposition is, in Mr. Meiklejohn's opinion, a movement of great importance to the success of the exposition.  He thinks that the presence of these newspaper men would give greater publicity to the magnificent condition of the grounds and the phenomenal success of the management than could be secured in any other way.  Mr. Mercer's plan is meeting with favor and promises which have been made him assure that the scheme will be carried through.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Eastern Magnate Looks Over the Grounds and Admits His Astonishment&#8212;Wagner Cars and Union Pacific Lines.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Dr. William Seward Webb, president of the Wagner Palace Car company, and a number of friends spent yesterday in Omaha.  The popular railroad magnate is en route from Mexico to New York, and he is in a hurry to get to the latter city in order to keep an appointment with Horace G. Burt, president of the Union Pacific railroad.  His mission with President Burt, as announced in The Bee last Thursday, is to consider arrangements for placing a great number of Wagner cars on the Union Pacific road with the idea of ultimately having none but Wagner sleeping cars operated on the "Overland Route."</p>
                            <p>Just before leaving Omaha last evening Dr. Webb accorded an interview to a Bee reporter, and when asked if the people of the west might soon expect Wagner cars exclusively operated on the Union Pacific, smiled and said:  "Well, perhaps.  But as president of the company I am hardly in a position to discuss the matter.  I certainly would like to see the Wagner company operate its cars on the Union Pacific, and I hope some day to see that a fact.  I am now on my way to New York and will see President Burt of the Union Pacific there on Thursday in regard to the matter.  There is nothing definite in regard to the subject, one way or the other, that can be given out at this time.  If there were I should be only too glad to give it to The Bee.  But you may look for some announcement along the line in which we have just been talking very soon, I think."</p>

                            <head type="sub">PRAISES THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>Dr. Webb was particularly enthusiastic over the buildings and grounds of the Transmississippi Exposition, which he had visited during the day.  In speaking of his trip through the exposition grounds he said:  "To say that we were all astonished is to put it very mildly, indeed.  Such elegant buildings I have not seen in a long time.  They compare favorably with anything that I ever saw, and in some respects even excel the World's fair buildings.  The broad scope, the magnitude of the whole affair just about took our breath away.  Anything that praises the progress thus far made and the prospects for a great exposition that you may write I'll endorse.  I cannot say too much in favor of the affair.  Was I favorably impressed?  Why, young man, I was just carried away; we were all delighted.  It's almost inconceivable that a western city should in such a short time build up an exposition like you have.  The people of the east do not thoroughly appreciate what a big affair this is going to be.  Why, from the way it looks now, it would be a credit to any government.  I believe the exposition will be a great success, and it will do Omaha and the whole west an immense amount of good.  The people of the east are gradually learning of its real proportions, and when the time comes a large number of them will come out to attend it."</p>
                            <p>"Dr. Webb, how did you find things further out west?"</p>
                            <p>"All right.  Business seems good generally, so far as I could observe.  We are just returning from a trip through Mexico, where we had an exceedingly pleasant time.  We stopped for a while in Salt Lake City and in Denver.  Both are fine cities and at both places they report business good and steadily improving.  Today we have enjoyed visits to Fort Crook and the exposition, under the kind direction of General Coppinger, and from here will go right along to New York.  As I told you, I have an appointment with President Burt in New York, but I shall be out to Omaha again soon."</p>

                            <p>With Dr. and Mrs. Webb are:  Mr. and Mrs. Townsend Burden, Mr. and Mrs. Purdy, Mr. and Mrs. Berd and Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence, New York, and J. C. Yager, general manager of the Wagner Palace Car company.  The latter joined the party in this city and while here had a short conference with General Manager Dickinson and Superintendent of Transportation Buckingham of the Union Pacific.  The party came in from the west on their own special train about 11 o'clock yesterday morning.  The train was switched from the tracks of the Union Pacific at Gilmore Junction and run to Fort Crook.  There the party was met by General Coppinger and shown over the grounds and buildings of the fort.  Yesterday afternoon was spent in Omaha, driving through the city and visiting the exposition grounds, in which all of the visitors appeared to be intensely interested.  The party left for Chicago over the Northwestern at 6 o'clock last evening.  The special train in which they traveled was one of the finest that ever passed through this city.  It consisted of four Wagner cars, all of the latest design and handsomely furnished.  They were the cars Ellsmere, Novara and Aladin from the Lake Shore limited and the cafe car from the Southwestern limited.  The train was drawn out of here by Northwestern locomotive No. 783.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Charles S. Kemper, representative of the Treasury department on the Board of Control of the Government building and exhibit, has notified the Department of Publicity and Promotion of the general character of the exhibit to be made by the Treasury department at the exposition.  Mr. Kemper encloses a description of the exhibit, as follows:</p>
                            <p>"The administrative functions of the Treasury department may be divided into three branches&#8212;the accounting, the financial and commercial.  The first of these consists in examining and revising every expenditure of the government, and no money appropriated by congress for the maintenance of the general government, or any of its branches, can be legally expended except upon the approval of the secretary of the treasury.  This branch of the department, being purely clerical, cannot be illustrated by an exhibit.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GREAT MONEY MAKER.</head>
                            <p>"The financial branch of the department is illustrated by a complete set of all the currency issued by the government, from a 10-cent shinplaster to a $10,000 gold note.  The process of coining the money of the government is shown by operating a coin press which has been in constant use in the Philadelphia mint for fifty-two years.  It has a capacity of 90,000 dollars per hour, and, in coining a silver dollar, strikes a blow equal to the weight of 100 tons.  In connection with the mint exhibit is also shown a complete set of the current coins of seventy of the principal nations of the world, and a full set of all the national medals authorized by congress.</p>
                            <p>"The Bureau of Engraving and Printing, in addition to showing all the paper money of the United States, will exhibit a plate printing press in operation, illustrating the manner in which United States notes are printed, and upon which will be printed a souvenir card of the exposition, showing the White House and capitol at Washington and portraits of the president and vice president.</p>
                            <p>"The commercial branch of the department has control of all matters pertaining to the collection of revenue, and, by analogy, congress has assigned to the secretary of the treasury the duty of enforcing all laws relating to domestic and foreign commerce of the United States, including the lighthouse establishment, the life saving service, the marine hospital service, the coat and geodetic survey and similar branches of government business.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">LIGHTHOUSE EXHIBIT.</head>
                            <p>"The lighthouse establishment will exhibit a more complete assortment of light apparatus and furnishings than ever before shown, consisting in part of one large second order bivalve lens weighing over eight tons, one third-order lens, flashing red and white lights alternately, and one fourth-order lens, all of which will be shown in operation, together with all the lighting appliances in use by the department.</p>
                            <p>"The marine hospital service's exhibit is striking and meritorious.  It is illustrative of the functions of the government in preventing the introduction and spread of epidemic diseases by the establishment of quarantine stations, where all vessels and passengers are examined by trained surgeons, and by the erection of government hospitals for the care and treatment of American and foreign seamen.  It consists of models and photographs of quarantine stations and hospitals, hospital furnishings and fittings, disinfecting apparatus and surgical instruments.</p>
                            <p>"The Treasury department, through the medium of the coast and geodetic survey, is the custodian of the standard weights and measures of the United States; and, under the authority of congress, supplies each state with a set of standard weights and measures, from which all others are made and tested, and these will be exhibited by the survey, accompanied with models of the metric system."</p>

                            <p>Mr. Kemper states that in addition to the display made in the government building, to which the foregoing description applies, the life saving service will maintain on the grounds a model station, showing the construction of the stations maintained by the service on the lake and sea coasts, equipped with all the most improved appliances and manned by a full crew.  Daily exhibitions will be given on the Mirror by this crew, showing the manner in which lives are saved from wrecked vessels, and the routine of life in this service will be shown.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LIFE SAVING STATION.</head>
                            <p>Bids for the construction of the life saving station on the exposition grounds will be opened by Superintendent Farnan March 25.  This building will be a two-story frame structure, 30x40 feet, and will stand on the south side of the main court directly opposite the middle of the Mirror.  It will contain a room for the large lifeboat with which daily exhibitions will be given, and in which will be stored all the paraphernalia which is in use in every station of the life saving service, including buoys of various kinds, life cars, life lines, small mortars for throwing lines to vessels, etc.  The crew of the station will occupy quarters in the building and the living quarters and all other portions of the building will be completely equipped.</p>
                            <p>"The machinery and other appliances required for the operation of the fish exhibit in the Government building have been shipped from Washington and Superintendent Farnan expects to receive this material within a very few days.  All of the machinery will be put in position at once and the tanks and other apparatus required for this exhibit will be completed as soon as possible in order that the fish may be installed in their new home at an early date and become acclimated before the warm weather begins.</p>
                            <p>The sea water required for the ocean fish will be brought from Marblehead Mass., and fourteen-tank cars containing this water are now on their way to Omaha.  The salt water used for the fish exhibit will be kept in circulation by means of force pumps.  The water is taken from the tanks and aerated before being returned in order to keep it in good condition.  All of this work requires the use of a great deal of machinery and it is this which is daily expected at the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PUTTING ON FINISHING TOUCHES.</head>
                            <p>Preparations are being made for placing in position on the extreme top of the dome of the Government building the large statue, "Liberty Enlightening the World," which is ready to take its stand on this lofty pedestal, 150 feet above the level of the ground, the highest point on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The beautiful and shapely dome is visible from all parts of the city and when the huge figure is placed on top of the graceful lantern it will be a landmark, visible from every side.  This figure of liberty is fourteen feet in height and weighs 2,000 pounds.  It is of plaster and is in several sections.  This figure was modeled by artists specially employed for that purpose by Alexander &amp; Sons, the staff contractors for the Government building.  These artists were given special quarters outside the exposition grounds and have been employed for several weeks in turning out this huge work.  A small model of the figure was made in Washington under the watchful eye of the architect of the building and shipped to Omaha.  From this model the large figure was made.  It is a perfect reproduction of Bartholdi's famous statue in New York harbor and is a most fitting embellishment of the beautiful building being erected by the government on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>A substantial staging has been constructed about the lantern and above the pedestal where the figure will rest when in position.  An ordinary manhole in the floor of the lantern will serve to haul up the smaller portions of the figure, but the large pieces will be dragged over the outside of the <choice><sic>done</sic><corr>dome</corr></choice>.  The statue will be assembled on its <choice><sic>pedestial</sic><corr>pedestal</corr></choice>, the several parts being securely fastened together with iron braces.</p>
                            <p>This work has been delayed by the high wind which has prevailed during the last week, but the preparations are nearly completed and the goddess will soon be at her post.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Great Activity Among Workers Watched by Interested Hundreds.</head>
                            <p>Many hundreds of people went to the exposition grounds on pleasure bent yesterday.  The main court and bluff tract were overrun with crowds of sight-seers.  Vehicles of every description thronged the bluff tract all day long, but the gates of the main court were closed against them.  A large proportion of the visitors were strangers, who took advantage of a short stay in the city to visit the grounds and see what the exposition promises.  The buildings and grounds were thoroughly inspected and the progress of the work was watched with a great deal of interest.</p>
                            <p>Residents of Omaha who had not visited the grounds for a week or more were amazed at the great changes which had in the meantime been made in the appearance of the grounds.  These changes were especially noticeable on the bluff tract.  This hitherto level piece of ground, unbroken by a tree or bush, has been changed into a forest of mature growth.  A force of 200 men under the energetic direction of Rudolf Ulrich, a landscape architect of renown especially engaged to direct this work, has covered this sightly location with a growth of trees and shrubbery which has completely changed the appearance of the place.  Instead of a fine stretch of land adapted for raising corn, it is now a beautiful park, with trees thickly dotting the scene and bushes and handsome shrubbery on every side.  Winding walks are bordered by trees thirty or forty feet in height, with spreading limbs already showing the buds, which give promise of abundant shade.  Thousands of bushes of every kind are distributed where their leafy growth will best add to the general effect, the whole producing a park-like effect, which promises to make this portion of the grounds the most attractive and popular resort within the exposition fence.</p>
                            <p>A puffing steam road roller, aided and abetted by a number of men and teams distributing cracked stone and gravel, is busily engaged in making macadam walks and drives all about this tract.</p>
                            <p>All was activity and the crowds seemed to derive great entertainment from watching the various stages of the work develop under the skillful hands of the workmen.  The full force of men in all branches of the work were busily engaged in pushing things to the limit and the changes which have been wrought form the best evidence of how well this has been done.</p>
                            <p>The south viaduct across Sherman avenue and the two restaurants adjoining it are well under way and are being pushed as fast as possible, all the men being employed that can be handled to advantage.  The same is true of the Moorish palace.  This handsome structure is assuming huge proportions and is attracting great attention.  Its unique form is the cause of considerable comment on the part of all who see it, the handsomely rounded dome and slender minarets, each and all surmounted by a golden crescent, forming a most attractive scene from every point of view.</p>
                            <p>The broad street which will form the central avenue of the Midway has been paved nearly to the north line of the Grand Plaza and has developed into a popular promenade for visitors to the grounds.  By its means they reach the north viaduct and Power plant, both of which are well advanced and rapidly nearing completion.</p>
                            <p>In strong contrast to the liberal treatment of the bluff tract, with its winding walks, bordered and shaded with tall trees and its profusion of shrubbery, is the effect of the main court.  As the work on both progresses the effect upon the visitor who passes from one to the other grows more pronounced.  The main court is now reaching a stage where the casual visitor receives a lasting impression of grandeur and beauty and can see, in his mind's eye, the surpassing magnificence which the finished court will present.</p>
                            <p>Work is being pushed very energetically on the exedra which will enclose the east end of the tract and form a foreground for the towering restaurants beyond on the bluff tract.  A force of 200 laborers has been employed for the last ten days in cleaning up the debris about the main buildings and in levelling the grounds and making preparations for the parking and laying of walks.  This preliminary work has added greatly to the appearance of the court and is a promise of the beauty which may be anticipated.  The earth removed in the leveling process is carried to depressions about the west end of the court and is thus made to serve a double purpose.</p>
                            <p>The scaffolding used by the staff workers has been removed from all except the Art and Government buildings.  A force of workmen is employed in the interior of the Art building and some of the galleries are nearly completed.  The fireproofing of the building has been about completed and work will soon be commenced on the exterior.</p>
                            <p>Work is being carried rapidly forward on the Government building and the great beauty of this magnificent structure is daily becoming more apparent.  The exterior of both wings is well nigh completed and the handsome central portion is rapidly taking on a finished appearance.</p>

The state has been divided into districts and a member of the commission placed in charge of each district.  Each county is supplied with an active committee working under the direction of a commissioner and special committee have been appointed to take charge of collecting the exhibits at central points and seeing to their shipment to Omaha.  Chairman Gwin has recently made a tour of the state and is quoted by the Boise Statesman as saying that the work is being done in a most satisfactory and thorough manner and will unquestionably result in a fine collection of material being exhibited at Omaha.</p>

                            <p>A telegram from President W. S. Mason of the Oregon Exposition commission to President Wattles notified the exposition management that the arrangements made by Commissioner Dosch of Portland a few days ago were ratified by the Oregon commission.  Mr. Dosch reserved 3,000 feet on the bluff tract for an Oregon building, 624 feet in the Agriculture building, 1,200 feet in the Forestry exhibit, 640 feet in the Liberal Arts building for an educational exhibit, 600 feet for a fish exhibit, 1,430 feet in the Mines building and 1,200 feet in the Horticulture building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION MANAGERS FACE A PROBLEM</head>
                            <head type="sub">Negotiations for Halls Have Thus Far Been Very Unsatisfactory and Building One Seems the Only Solutions.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The providing of a large hall for the accommodation of the numerous conventions, congresses, etc., which will meet in Omaha during the coming summer is a matter which has become an especially live issue since the refusal of the trustees of the First Congregational church to allow that church to be used by the Woman's club between June and November in order to carry out the club's desire to co-operate with the exposition and provide a meeting place for a large proportion of the conventions.</p>
                            <p>A committee of the Woman's club and President Wattles of the exposition have held numerous conferences with the church trustees and it was generally understood that the matter was virtually settled and that the church was to be turned over to the women to be used every day except Sunday for congresses or conventions.  There are about 100 conventions and congresses which will meet in Omaha during the coming summer, and the purpose of the Woman's club was to have a large proportion of the smaller gatherings, those where the attendance would not exceed 100 or so, meet in the church.  It was a part of the plan to have a committee of women from the club act as hostesses for each of these conventions and look after the decorations of the church.  The trustees took exception to the idea of having gatherings of men in the church, some of them being afraid that the men might put their feet over the back of the pews or smoke or do some other objectionable thing, notwithstanding the presence of the women of the reception committee.  The trustees indicated their willingness to grant the use of the church if allowed to select the conventions or congresses which were to be allowed to meet there.  The other parties to the agreement positively refused to be thus restricted and the refusal of the trustees to allow the church to be used for any conventions followed.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OTHER CHURCHES OBJECT.</head>
                            <p>Prior to the negotiations with the trustees of the First Congregational church the committee of the Woman's club interviewed the officers of some of the other down town churches.  The trustees of the First Methodist church declined to consider any proposition looking to the use of that church for conventions of any kind.  The officials in control of the Kountze Memorial church were willing to negotiate with the club representatives on the basis of $2,000 as rental, but stipulated that they  must be allowed to select the gatherings which would meet in the church.  Especial objection was made to the Congress of Liberal Religions and a proposition involving the holding of this meeting in the church would not be considered.  As the club representatives and the exposition officials declined to have their course dictated by outside authorities the negotiations were dropped at that point Unity church was the only one of the down-town religious edifices which was  offered without strings at a rental of $500, but the auditorium of this building is rather small and would accommodate only the smallest of the gatherings.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has taken up the matter in another way and has written to the Commercial club asking that organization to take hold of the project to erect a temporary hall somewhere down town which shall have a seating capacity of about 6,000, so arranged that it may be divided into smaller halls to accommodate several small gatherings at the same time.  The exposition management will head a subscription list for such a purpose with a liberal subscription and the Commercial club is asked to take charge of the matter and push it to early consummation.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles says this is the only apparent solution of this question.  The negotiations for the use of the Coliseum have come to naught and the president says something must be done to provide a meeting place for the great conventions which will come, while the failure of the negotiations for churches and smaller halls makes it absolutely necessary that something be done at once to provide for the smaller gatherings.</p>

By May 1 the floor of each building will be marked out in such a way that each exhibitor may know just where he is located and on this date the installation will commence.  The placing of many of the heavier exhibits will probably commence some time before this date, notably in the Machinery and Electricity building.  By May 25 all exhibits will be required to be in place, and the time intervening before June 1 will be devoted to clearing away the debris and getting ready for the opening day.  Between May 25 and June 10 no exhibits will be received under any circumstances, but after the last named date delayed exhibitors who can offer a good excuse for delay will be allowed to take the space assigned to them.</p>

                            <p>Messrs Casper and Boydston of the special committee went out to the Nebraska building yesterday afternoon and decided, after making a careful examination of the various rooms, that the commission could provide desk room for twenty-six secret societies or other organizations by placing desks around in out-of-the-way corners in the rotunda on the first and second floors.  The places available for such use are well lighted and can be used for such purpose without interfering with the other uses to which the building will be devoted.  Governor Holcomb will be assigned a suite of two rooms on the second floor at the north end of the building, including the large room in the center of this end, which will serve as a reception room, and a smaller room in the northeast corner, which will serve as a private office.  The corresponding room in the center of the north end  of the first floor will be assigned to the Grand Army of the Republic.  This room is 16x33 feet in size.  No other society will be given the exclusive use of a room in the building.  The exact uses to which the remaining rooms will be devoted have not been determined, but one or two will be used by the commission for offices, another will be assigned to the hostess of the building, Miss Butterfield, and the others will be used for waiting rooms for both men and women, telegraph room, check room, toilet rooms, etc.</p>

                            <p>A novel and very beautiful fountain, designed by Luther M. Stieringer, the consulting electrical engineer for the exposition, has been approved by the executive committee and its construction will be commenced at once.</p>
                            <p>This fountain has been baptized "Nautilus" and it will occupy a conspicuous place in the Mirror.  The central figure is a column of the Ionic order, fifty feet in height, on the top of which will appear the figure of Neptune, the gods of the seas, holding aloft his trident and commanding the broad expanse of water beneath his feet.  About the base of this column, just below the surface of the water, will be thousands of jets which will produce the most marvelous effects with the sparkling water.  When the fountain is not in action there will be nothing to break the placid surface of the water except the tall column, but when the word is given thousands of beautiful forms will be assumed and the sparkling fluid will be thrown to great heights in ever changing variety.</p>
                            <p>At night electric beams of brilliant colors will be thrown upon the sparkling water from an invisible source and the most startling and beautiful effects will be produced.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission completed its business and adjourned shortly after noon today.  There was little business to be done, the disposal of the report of the special committee on employes and the setting aside of the various amounts for each department having made almost a clean slate.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Whitford announced that the Nebraska building has been entirely completed and is ready for acceptance.  At his suggestion a committee of two, Neville and Whitford, was appointed to make a thorough examination of the building in company with the architects and accept it if the work is found to be in compliance with the specifications and plans.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Boydston and Dutton were appointed a committee to make arrangements for lighting the Nebraska building.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Pegler of the poultry bureau tendered his resignation and it was accepted.  Mr. Boydston nominated C. M. Richards of Omaha as superintendent of this bureau and the appointment was confirmed.</p>
                            <p>On motion of Commissioner Poynter Fish Commissioner Lew May was asked to make an estimate of the cost of making an exhibit representing the fish industry of Nebraska in connection with the fish exhibit in the Government building and submit the same to the next meeting of the commission.</p>

                            <p>According to the report of the special committee to designate the uses of the several rooms in the Nebraska building the first floor of the building will contain the following:  Headquarters for the educational department; headquarters for the Nebraska Press association, telegraph and telephone rooms, postoffice, men's waiting room and toilet room, free check room, women's waiting room and toilet room, intelligence office, general registration room.  On the second floor will be rooms set apart as follows:  Private room and reception room for the governor, headquarters for the Nebraska Exposition commission, cloak room for the commission, a room for women's clubs and societies, office for the hostess of the building and the official stenographer, a room for a large collection of Indian relics belonging to the late General Crook.  The north wall of the balcony on this floor will be occupied by the Nebraska Historical society, with a display of interesting relics.  The report also finds that there is room in the angles and alcoves on both floors of the building for about twenty desks for the use of such fraternal societies as may desire to take advantage of this opportunity establishing headquarters in this building.</p>

                            <p>The force of employes to be engaged for the Nebraska building, includes one hostess at $75 per month, one assistant hostess at $60, one custodian at $65, one postmistress at $50, three janitors at $45 each, two policemen at $50 each, two messenger boys at $25 each, one clerk in the intelligence office at $60, two employes in the check rooms at $40 each, one porter at $1.50 per day, one general registry clerk at $50 per month.</p>
                            <p>The commission met in executive session last night to consider the report of the committee appointed at the last meeting to decide upon the number of employes required.  The special committee found that in addition to the assistant secretary, <choice><sic>bookkkeeper</sic><corr>bookkeeper</corr></choice> and typewriter, the care of the building will require forty-four employes, whose salary to the close of the exposition will aggregate $5,527.50.  The amounts set apart for salaries in the several departments were as follows:  Educational, $1,720; agriculture, $1,640; floriculture, $1,120; horticulture, $1,420; live stock, $770; dairy, $700; poultry, $230; apiary, $755; total salaries of employes, $13,607.50.  Employes now on rolls, twenty, leaving twenty-four to be employed.  The committee recommended that the total number of employes be divided among the six congressional districts in the state and that each member name the employes in his district, taking into account the number heretofore appointed.</p>
                            <p>The estimates for the expenses of the several departments were allowed as follows:  Educational, $2,157.38; floriculture, $1,000; poultry, $600; apiary, $975; agriculture, $1,196.17; live stock, $3,000; dairy, $1,875; horticulture, $6,000; total, $16,803.55.</p>
                            <p>The salaries of the commissioners and expenses provided for by former action and by this report aggregated $93,093.51, leaving a balance of the appropriation amounting to $6,906.49.</p>
                            <p>The report of the committee was adopted, it being 11:30 p. m. when the doors were opened.</p>

                            <p>The program for the exercises in connection with the opening of the Transmississippi and International Exposition has been ratified by the executive committee as prepared by President Wattles and the nature of the exercises which will inaugurate an enterprise fraught with such importance to the great transmississippi region is now definitely settled.</p>
                            <p>According to this program the exercises will commence with a grand military and civic parade participated in by organized bodies of all kinds, a large number of which have already signified their intention of coming to Omaha from other points.  This parade will form down town at 10 o'clock on the morning of June 1, and will pass through the principal streets of the city to the exposition grounds, reaching there at 12 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>The exercises at the grounds will commence as soon as the parade reaches that point.  These exercises will consist of music, prayer and the reading of an original poem composed for the reading of an original poem composed for the occasion and read by the author.  President Wattles will deliver an appropriate address, followed by an oration by Chauncey M. Depew of New York.  An address by Senator W. V. Allen will complete the oratorical portion of the program and communication will be opened by long distance telephone with President McKinley at Washington.  The president will, at the proper moment, close the electric circuit which will start the machinery of the exposition and fire a grand salute to announce to the world that the Transmississippi and International Exposition has been opened promptly on time and is ready for the inspection of the multitudes.</p>
                            <p>At 3 o'clock the officers of the exposition and their wives will hold a reception on the grounds for the many distinguished guests and the inaugural exercises will be concluded.</p>
                            <p>Invitations to Messrs. Depew and Allen to participate in the opening exercises have been sent forward and favorable replies are anticipated.</p>
                            <p>In addition to taking action on the program for the opening day, the executive committee yesterday approved the action of President Wattles in calling upon the Commercial club to take the initiative in the matter of erecting a large convention hall down town for the use of the scores of conventions and congresses which will meet in Omaha during the coming summer.  The committee authorized the president, in case the Commercial club agrees to take hold of the matter to pledge the support of the exposition to the scheme to the extent of $3,000, with the understanding that the hall is to be under the control of the exposition to the extent of providing for the conventions and congresses referred to.</p>
                            <p>The contract for painting and calsomining the interior of the buildings in the main court was awarded to W. H. Woerheide, the lowest bidder for the work.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed was authorized to made a contract for a concession for a canal 1,000 feet in length which is to be bordered with California scenery and displays of California fruit of all kinds and other California products.</p>

                            <p>These actors are a part of the company which will occupy the Chinese village on the Midway, for which Hong Sling has the concession.  Sling is expected in the city in the near future to being the work of erecting the Chinese village.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Exhibits is preparing the rules for the Dairy bureau, and these will be promulgated within a few days.  The premium list for short horn cattle will be issued in a day or two.</p>
                            <p>S. D. Kramer of Chicago, a music publisher, writes that he is about to publish a march entitled "Salute to Omaha," and he asks the privilege of calling it the official march of the exposition and placing on the title page a cut of one of the main buildings.</p>
                            <p>The rush of business in the several departments of the exposition has made it necessary to provide many of the departments with telephones, and the list of exposition 'phones is as follows:  President's office, 1441; Transportation department, 2072; Concessions department, 1896; Buildings and Grounds department, 1899; Electrical bureau, 1875; secretary's office, 1898.</p>
                            <p>E. W. McConnell, a cyclorama expert, has arrived in the city to take charge of the construction of the cyclorama which will be erected on the Midway.  This building will be 400 feet in circumference and about 45 feet in height.  Construction on it will be commenced at once, and Mr. McConnell says everything will be in readiness for opening by May 25.  The cyclorama will contain a scene showing the battle between the Merrimac and Monitor.</p>

                            <p>The First Congregational church was crowded last evening with the members of the Woman's club, friends and escorts, who gathered to hear an address by Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin of Chicago, president of the General Federation of Woman's clubs.  After a simple and graceful word of introduction from Mrs. Harford, president of the Omaha Woman's club, Mrs. Henrotin responded to the Chautauqua salute which was given her, and without preamble entered upon the discussion of a subject which, though she declined to state it, was chiefly concerned with expositions and women.</p>
                            <p>She touched upon the first great exposition instituted by the prince consort of England, and spoke of its effect in rousing other nations, noticeably Austria, to more industrial enterprise.  She passed on to the Centennial at Philadelphia, associating with it the claims of the recent artistic development of this country and explaining how women were given association with it "if they would raise the money."  She dwelt for a moment upon the late French exposition, where the women were permitted to hold a congress; a man, however, the commissioner of instruction, having been provided to preside and keep order, and reached the climax of her history in the Columbian exposition.  Here, she said, began a movement in the governmental recognition of women, for every great government appointed its women commissioners.  This fact was largely due to the tact of Mrs. Potter Palmer, whom she characterized as "a statesman."</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Henrotin thought the material exhibit in the Woman's building scarcely representative of woman's work&#8212;which is not of a material sort.  "A woman," she said, "is not an originator, she is a co-ordinator.  Look how she brings into relation the parts of education.  A few years ago higher education was a thing apart, now women bring the child from the kindergarten into the higher education.  The one is a part of the other."</p>
                            <p>From this point the speaker elaborated the history of the club movement.  Forty years ago man brought into the home the raw material and women converted it to living uses.  Spinning, weaving, dressmaking, nursing, all the industrial functions were developed in the home, but gradually, as factories assumed these function, the woman grew out of her position as an economic factor.  From being a producer she became a money spender.  Then came her desire for training, for education, which grew at last into the idea that knowledge to be valuable must be transmitted.  Hence the large department club.</p>
                            <p>Illustrations were given of the altruistic work of these clubs.  "Giving and receiving are one," said the speaker.  "A woman brings to the club her best &#8212;a sacred and beautiful thing&#8212;but whatever it is she simply follows her bent, which is <choice><sic>constuctive</sic><corr>constructive</corr></choice>, educational, nonresisting."</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Henrotin is a slight, graceful woman, with a pleasant voice, which she uses without effort.  She was charming last evening in a gown of brocaded satin and mouseline de soie of a delicate pink color.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of Mrs. Henrotin's address the president introduced "our own Mrs. Stoutenborough" of Plattsmouth, president of the Nebraska <choice><sic>Fereration</sic><corr>Federation</corr></choice> of Clubs, who was received with applause and the Chautauqua salute.  She said she looked through country, and not city, spectacles, and then she went on to say how large a factor she believed the Woman's club to be in moulding the intellectual life of the small community.  She answered convincingly the objector who believes the club hinders the woman's work in the church and that other critic who thinks the club interferes with home duties  "Society may endanger the home life," she said, "so may dress, but the club never does; we do better teaching than that."</p>
                            <p>After recess the platform was cleared and Miss Stella Hamilton announced a drama to be given by the younger women of the club.  It consisted of a representation of the various nations of the earth in consultation with Columbia over the Transmississippi Exposition.  Miss Harford as England, Miss Byrne as Germany, Miss Chandler as France, Mrs. Caldwell as Holland and Mrs. Patrick as Columbia has leading parts and the performance was enlivened by local specialties, by a song from Scotland&#8212;Mrs. Fitt&#8212;and by "The Choir Invisible," which in the persons of Messrs. Wheeler, Hazelton, Copeland and Haverstock discoursed music just outside the door.  The major domo, Miss Allen, assisted as a whistler in the closing ode, "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," and the audience rose and joined in the chorus, after which most of those present came forward to be presented individually to Mrs. Henrotin.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Henrotin was entertained at luncheon at the Millard by the Woman's club today.  She will return to Chicago tonight.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FISH EXHIBIT AT THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Arranging the Big Tanks Which Will Form the Government's Aquarium is Now Well Under Way.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Active preparations are being made for the exhibit to be made by the Fish commission in the Government building.  The nature and extent of this exhibit make it necessary to make rather elaborate preparations for the installation of the finny tribes which will take up their residence in the Government building some time during the month of May.  Mr. G. A. Snyder, an officer of the Fish commission, is in the city to give the work his personal supervision and under his direction the work is rapidly taking form.</p>
                            <p>The fish exhibit will occupy the west half of the north wing of the Government building.  The aquarium for the display of live fish will <choice><sic>naturaly</sic><corr>naturally</corr></choice> form the most attractive portion of this exhibit, and it is in connection with this that the preparations spoken of are being made.  This aquarium will form three sides of a rectangle, the long side being about ninety feet in length and the two shorter sides being each thirty feet long.  Entrance will be had through the outer ends of the short sides.  The entrances to the aquarium will be handsomely finished with imitation rock work, having the appearance of entrances to a tunnel, with a high arch surmounted by a statue representing Neptune, while at the base of the arch, on either side of the entrance, will be mermaids and dolphins and other ornamental figures.  The interior of the tunnel will be constructed to represent rock work.  At either side will be a long row of glass tanks resting on a base of rough rocks, while from the top of the tanks will spring the arch of the tunnel.  The arch will be hung with stalactites and the whole character of the tunnel will be that of a passageway through an underground cavern.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WILL MAKE FISH VISIBLE.</head>
                            <p>The only light in this tunnel will be that which penetrates through the glass tanks and the water contained in them.  The bottom of each tank will be covered with white sand and the back will be painted a light color.  Shells and other natural objects will be strewn about to give the tank the appearance of nature.  The effect of this construction will be to make the inhabitants of the tanks plainly visible.  In the angles formed at the turns in the tunnel will be large circular tanks, which will be decorated with aquatic growth and lighted by clusters of electric lights.  Bright colored fish will swim about in these tanks, reflecting the rays of light from their glistening sides.</p>
                            <p>To properly <choice><sic>instal land</sic><corr>install and</corr></choice> maintain this aquarium for the display of live fish requires an immense amount of detail work.  In order to keep the water in the tanks at the proper temperature and in proper condition as to cleanliness it is necessary to install a complete outfit of machinery.  The sea water especially requires considerably attention.  It is shipped here in large tank cars and is used over and over, every drop of it being carefully saved until the exposition is over.  It is passed through a coil which brings it to the proper temperature and is then introduced into the tanks, the overflow being caught by troughs beneath the tanks and returned to the large reservoir beneath the floor of the building.  After passing through a filter which removes all the foreign matter, it is pumped into a large reservoir above the aquarium, and thence through the temperature coils to the tanks.  In the tanks the water is aerated by means of rubber tubes fitted with wooden ends.  Air is forced into these tubes and finds its way out through the pores of the wood, permeating all of the water.  About 40,000 gallons of sea water is required to keep the tanks full and supply the system of reservoirs used in connection with the plant.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FOR FRESH WATER FISH.</head>
                            <p>The fresh water is fed into a reservoir and passes from this through cooling coils where the temperature is lowered to the proper point <choice><sic>fo rthe</sic><corr>for the</corr></choice> cold water fish, such as brook trout, etc., or through other coils which changes the temperature to such point as may be required.  It then passes into the glass tanks, <choice><sic>an dfrom</sic><corr>and from</corr></choice> thence into a waste pipe which carries the overflow to the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The tanks in which the fish will be shown are in Omaha, having been shipped here from Nashville when that exposition was closed.  They will be put in position very soon.  The machinery for the plant is expected daily and this will be installed as soon as received.</p>
                            <p>The display of live fish is not the only showing that will be made by the Fish commission.  In the space enclosed by the sides of the tunnel will be shown stuffed fish and casts of all kinds of fish and marine monsters.  Models of vessels used by the commission for investigating the depths of the ocean and models of fish hatcheries and numerous other appliances used by the commission will be shown.</p>

                            <head type="sub">First Installment from the East Comes in Unexpectedly.</head>
                            <p>The first installment of exhibits has arrived.  Several prospective exhibitors from New York shipped a number of show cases which arrived to perplex the Exhibits department.  None of the buildings on the grounds are in shape to receive exhibits, as the painting of the interior is yet to be done.  Contracts for this work has been executed, but it will be several days before the first building is completed.  The Mines building is in the hands of the painters and will be finished on the inside in a short time, but in the meantime the goods in question will <choice><sic>ha evto</sic><corr>have to</corr></choice> be stored down town.  The warehouse of the Transportation department has not yet been located, and no plans have <choice><sic>ben</sic><corr>been</corr></choice> made for it, but the arrival of <choice><sic>th eexhibits</sic><corr>The exhibits</corr></choice> referred to will probably hasten this work.</p>
                            <p>In the same connection Superintendent E. D. Johnson of the Agricultural bureau of the Nebraska commission, appeared at exposition headquarters and <choice><sic>aske dto</sic><corr>asked to</corr></choice> be shown the space assigned to Nebraska in the Agriculture building.  As that building has not been accepted from the contractor he was asked to wait a little longer before beginning his work of installing the Nebraska exhibit.</p>

The Indian bureau is proceeding in its preparations for the great Indian congress as though the bill had been passed, the officials having assurances that it will become a law very soon.  The officers of the mint at Philadelphia are preparing the dies for the exposition medals and the Postoffice department is rushing work on the special exposition postage stamps, which will be issued about May 15.  Negotiations are pending for the services of the Marine band and no doubt is entertained about this famous organization being seen at the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben Willing to Give Up Their Den.</head> 
                            <p>The Coliseum may be transformed into a huge convention hall to accommodate the bigger gatherings to be held here during the coming summer.  This possibility is a result of a joint meeting of members of the exposition board, Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben and Commercial club yesterday afternoon.  The meeting was attended by Mayor Moores, G. D. Wattles, W. R. Bennett, J. E. Utt, G. A. Andreesen, C. A. Wilhelm, Clement Chase, J. E. Baum and Major Wilcox.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was called for the purpose of devising some means of securing or building a large hall.  All the discussion centered about the Coliseum building, however, from the fact that the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben offered to turn it over for the purpose on condition that they were provided with suitable quarters for the construction of floats and for their meetings.  These quarters will be in the shape of sheds about the building.</p>
                            <p>No conclusion was reached, but Major Wilcox and President Wattles of the exposition were appointed a committee to visit the Coliseum and its surroundings for the purpose of making an estimate of the cost of transforming the building into a convention hall and of erecting sheds.  This committee will report at a meeting to be held this afternoon at 4 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that the Coliseum will afford a suitable and big enough hall if the cost of putting it into shape is not too large.  The building will seat about 10,000 people.</p>

                            <p>Dr. George L. Miller has received a letter from Allen Blacker of El Paso, Tex., which indicates the remarkable interest of Texas people in the Transmississippi Exposition.  Mr. Blacker was thirty years ago a prominent citizen of Omaha and is now as prominent in the southern state.  During the last presidential campaign he was the political editor of the El Paso Tribune.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Blacker wrote to Dr. Miller for the purpose of securing some facts about the exposition and cuts of the main buildings to be used in a special exposition edition the Tribune proposes to issue.  His request was turned over to the Department of Publicity of the exposition which will supply the Tribune with everything wanted.  In the letter Mr. Blacker writes:</p>
                            <p>"Texas proposes to attend largely and is now organizing for the work.  The publisher of the El Paso Tribune is contemplating a Nebraska-Texas edition and asks me to assist him in the work.  We calculate upon an edition of 20,000.  There will be a large attendance from Texas at the exposition if it is not too expensive, and a very creditable contribution, whatever it may cost.  Texas has surpluses to exchange with Nebraska, besides a large coast which Texans fondly compare with the Mediterranean."</p>

                            <p>Arrangements for the congress of Woman's clubs, to be held in connection with the exposition, are in an advanced stage, and the preliminary details have been worked out.  The presence in Omaha of Mrs. Henrotin, president of the National Federation of Woman's Clubs, has contributed very materially to the efforts of the congress committee to perfect the details of this meeting.</p>
                            <p>The congress will be held June 18 and 19.  Arrangements have been made, whereby the special trains from Boston, New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and other points, carrying their loads of delegates to the meeting of the National Federation of Woman's Clubs at Denver, will stop in Omaha, June 18, for the purpose of enabling all these women to attend the congress and visit the exposition.  The morning will be given up to a visit to the exposition and in the afternoon the first session of the congress will be held in the Auditorium on the exposition grounds.  In the evening a session will be held at some point downtown.  Both sessions will be devoted to the discussion of economic questions, and the congress committee have well grounded hopes that Mrs. Clara de Graffenreid, assistant to Carroll D. Wright, United States commissioner of labor, will address one of these meetings.</p>
                            <p>June 19, being Sunday, no meeting of the congress will be held in the morning, but in the afternoon there will be a session at some point downtown, which will be addressed by Mrs. Celia Parker Wooley and Mrs. Caroline Bartlett Crane.</p>
                            <p>The congress committee has also made progress with the formation of a Woman's Christian Temperance Union congress.  The general committee of arrangements and the local committee have been appointed and the work of arranging the program will be taken up.  The general committee consists of these women:  Mrs. Helen M. Barker of Chicago, treasurer of the National <choice><sic>Waman's</sic><corr>Woman's</corr></choice> Christian Temperance union; Mrs. Louise S. Rounds of Illinois, Mrs. Mary J. Telford of Colorado, Miss Bell Kearney of Mississippi, and Mrs. Mary C. Upham of Wisconsin.  This committee is charged with the duty of preparing the program for the congress and fixing the date for the event.  The local committee which will have charge of the entertainment of the congress, comprises the following women:  Mrs. S. M. Walker of Lincoln, president of the Nebraska Woman's Christian Temperance union; Rev. Mary Girard Andrews of Omaha, president of the Omaha union; Dr. Freda Lankton and Mrs. George Tilden of Omaha, and Mrs. E. B. Towle of South Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Government Officials Do All They Can to Aid the Work.</head>
                            <p>Congressman D. H. Mercer has written to President Wattles regarding securing from the War department the tents necessary for the military encampment which is to be maintained in connection with the exposition.  It is proposed to equip the camp grounds with tents and various other necessaries and an effort is being made to induce the War department to loan the exposition the necessary tents for the occasion.  Mr. Mercer writes that the matter can probably be arranged.  He says Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn has taken hold of the matter and the prospect for securing the tents is promising.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer also writes concerning the projected special trains from Washington to Omaha for bringing to the exposition on the opening day the Washington correspondents of the great metropolitan newspapers and the members of both houses of congress.  The congressman says that E. C. Snyder, the Washington correspondent of The Bee, has been commissioned by the Department of Publicity and Promotion to take up the eastern end of the negotiations with the railroads and has the matter well in hand.  Mr. Mercer says he is lending the movement all the assistance in his power and believes it is the best move that could possibly be made.  He says that Washington is the temporary home of the brightest and brainiest newspaper men in the world, and they are enthusiastic over the idea of making such a trip to Omaha under such circumstances, and have made many inquiries regarding the matter.  Mr. Mercer declares that such a move would be the best advertisement that the exposition could possibly secure, and he urges that nothing be left undone to carry it to a successful issue.</p>
                            <p>Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn urged this same matter upon the exposition officials when he was in Omaha and emphasized very strongly the great advantage the exposition would derive from the widespread advertisement given the opening of the great show in all the big papers of the country.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Campbell Makes an Explanation to the Public.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Campbell of the Nebraska Exposition commission is greatly annoyed by reports which are being circulated by unknown parties to the effect that the Nebraska commission is charging for exhibit space in the Nebraska building on the bluff tract.  Mr. Campbell wants it distinctly understood that no exhibits are allowed in the Nebraska building under any circumstances and consequently no charge can be made for space in the building for exhibits.  The building is intended solely for social functions and to serve as headquarters for Nebraskans and such others as desire to avail themselves of Nebraska's hospitality.  The Nebraska Historical society and the owner of the extensive collection of Indian curios gathered by the late General Crook have been given space in the building in which to exhibit the rare and curious articles comprising these collections, but these are in the nature of decorations rather than exhibits in the ordinary sense.  With these exceptions no exhibits will be allowed in the building.</p>
                            <p>The secretary also wishes to remind those desiring to exhibit Nebraska products that space is furnished free in the main exposition buildings by the Nebraska commission upon application to the proper superintendent and free transportation is furnished by the railroads to and from the exposition.</p>

It is eight feet long, six feet wide and four and one-half feet thick.  It is bituminous coal and weighs five tons.  The slab of copper matte is from the Anaconda works at Anaconda.

                            <p>The negotiations which have been pending for the use of the den of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben as a convention hall for the large conventions, which will be held in Omaha during the exposition have been dropped and another method for providing for these conventions will be adopted.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles, who has been acting as a committee to represent the exposition by virtue of the fact that the executive department is charged with the duty of providing such accommodations, visited the old Coliseum building yesterday, in company with an architect, to examine the building and determine the extent and cost of the changes necessary to fit the place for use as a convention hall.  It was found that it would be necessary to make a number of changes in the interior of the building, and also to meet the requirements of the knights by erecting a temporary shed for housing the floats during the construction of these adjuncts to the fall festivities.  The total cost of the work necessary to be done was estimated by the architect at about $8,000.  It was estimated by the architect that the construction of a temporary auditorium at some convenient point down town would cost about $20,000.</p>
                            <p>After receiving this information, President Wattles decided that neither method could be carried out by the exposition management alone, and as no assistance is in sight, he decided to adopt another course.  He will endeavor to secure a large tent, which will be erected at some convenient point down town, where it will serve for the largest gatherings.  Mr. Wattles says that there will be but three or four gatherings of great size and the tent could be made to answer for these, while the smaller conventions can be cared for in the halls and theaters down town and in the auditorium on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>By adopting this course President Wattles hopes to accommodate all of the conventions without friction.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Serves Notice that the Wage Agreement is Being Violated.</head>
                            <p>A rumble of impending trouble with organized labor was heard at the meeting of the executive committee yesterday afternoon, when a formal notice was received from the officers of the Building Trades council announcing that at the last meeting of the council a resolution was adopted declaring that the exposition management had violated the agreement with organized labor by employing laborers to do carpenter work and paying electrical workers less than the union scale.  The exposition officials were notified that unless action was taken within forty-eight hours to right these alleged grievances the Building Trades council would take action under its rules.</p>
                            <p>This matter was referred to a special committee, consisting of Managers Kirkendall and Rosewater and President Wattles, to confer with the committee of the Building Trades council and report upon the situation and the remedy which should be adopted.</p>
                            <p>The grievance of the Building and Trades council is understood to be that laborers are employed by the electrical construction bureau to make rough board boxes to be used for underground conduits for electric wires, it being claimed that this work should be done by carpenters at the regular scale.  Another alleged cause for complaint is that Superintendent Rustin of the electrical bureau is employing men to do electrical work and compelling them to work ten hours for $2.50 per day, whereas it is claimed that the union scale calls for eight hours' work at 30 cents per hour.</p>
                            <p>Certain of the exposition officials say, concerning the last named grievance, that at the time when the exposition decided to pay the union scale of wages the schedule submitted by the representatives of organized labor did not contain any mention of electrical workers, and it is claimed that the Electrical Workers' union was not in existence at that time.  It is further stated by these same officials that inquiry among the electric construction companies reveals that $2.50 per day is more than was paid by them for labor at the time the exposition directory fixed the scale of wages.</p>
                            <p>In addition to considering this matter the executive committee was presented with a request from the Woman's Board of Managers, asking to be given the control of the main court for two hours on a date to be afterward fixed, the women desiring to work up a great celebration in honor of the inauguration of work on the Girls' and Boys' building.  They proposed to have a short program of exercises in honor of the occasion, consisting of speeches by two or three well known men and speaking by three young people, one to be chosen by the schools of Omaha, another by the schools of South Omaha and the third by the schools of Lincoln.  The program included a grand march about the grand court behind a brass band, with High school cadets as marshals to see that the youngsters kept in line.  The women proposed to turn a neat little sum of money into the building fund by charging each child 10 cents for a vote for the speakers, the 10 cents to pay for a ticket to the grounds.  The gates were also to be turned over to the women, according to the proposition, and in this way a considerable sum was expected to be realized.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee thought the element of danger in the scheme was too great to consent to it, however, and the request of the women was denied.</p>
                            <p>Plans were ordered drawn for the Transportation warehouse and work on them will be pushed and the building erected at once.  The structure will be 50x100 feet and will stand on the north tract east of the Transportation building.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Nebraska Press association will meet in Omaha Monday afternoon, arriving on the Burlington at 4:05 p. m.  The committee will confer with the exposition authorities regarding accommodations on the grounds for members of the association during the exposition.</p>
                            <p>When the Nebraska Exposition commission designated the use to which the rooms in the Nebraska building should be devoted they set aside a room on the main floor, 16x33 feet in size, for the use of the Nebraska Press association, but some of the members of the association think this is not sufficient and they will ask the exposition management to arrange for more commodious quarters.  In the preliminary plans made for the Service building to be erected on Twentieth street just north of the Administration arch, a large room was shown on the second floor for representatives of newspapers, and it has been proposed to turn this over to the Nebraska Press association for the use of its members and of visiting newspaper men.  These matters will be discussed with the executive committee of the association on its arrival and ample accommodation for all newspaper representatives will be provided.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Kansas Commission Will Be Named on Monday.</head>
                            <p>Governor Leedy of Kansas has at last given positive and definite assurances that he will name an exposition commission for that state and announced that fact to the Department of Publicity and Promotion by telegraph yesterday as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Kansas commission at the Omaha exposition will be appointed next Monday.</p>
                            <ab>J. W. LEEDY.</ab>
                            <p>The governor has said all along that he would appoint a commission as soon as he had assurances that a sufficient amount of money would be forthcoming to enable the state to participate in a creditable manner.  After considerable agitation of the subject three Kansas railroads agreed to contribute $5,000 each, making $15,000, provided the citizens of Kansas would raise a like amount.  Governor Leedy refused to not, however, until he knew that the money would be forthcoming from both sides and his pertinacity in this report has prevented the appointment of a commission.  It is presumed that the money has been raised or that the governor has positive evidence that it will be forthcoming at the proper time or he would not have made the announcement contained in the telegram heretofore quoted.</p>

                            <p>The last issue of the National Journal of Education, one of the leading educational publications of the United States, includes a very flattering editorial comment on the latest work of State Superintendent W. W. Stetson of Maine, who has been secured as one of the general speakers for the Transmississippi Educational congress.  The Journal says:  "State Superintendent W. W. Stetson's report of the schools of Maine for 1897 is one of the greatest educational documents of the day, as it is of all time.  There has never been a greater contribution to the cause of rural schools than that section of the report which is entitled, 'A Study of the Schools of Northeastern Maine.'  No other man in any land or age has treated rural schools more intelligently and more helpfully than is here done.  This ought to be printed in large quantities that all may have it who need it.  Indeed, it should have as large a circulation as the famous fifth annual report of Horace Mann.'</p>

                            <p>President Wattles received a telegram from Senator Pusey of Council Bluffs, a member of the upper house of the Iowa legislature, announcing that the senate had passed the exposition bill appropriating $20,000 additional for Iowa's participation in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>This will necessitate returning the bill to the house for concurrence, that body having passed the bill with an appropriation of $30,000.  The friends of the measure hope to have the amount increased to $25,000 before the bill finally becomes a law.</p>
                            <p>Iowa has already appropriated $10,000 for participation in the exposition, the last legislature having made a preliminary appropriation of this amount.  The Iowa Exposition commission appealed to the legislature at the beginning of the session to make an appropriation of $47,400 in order to enable the commission to erect a suitable building on the exposition grounds and make a creditable showing.</p>

                            <p>Exposition authorities have considered the proposition of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben to permit the exposition to use the Coliseum for assembly purposes providing that buildings be furnished in which the work on floats and other preparations for the pageant could be carried on.  Estimates as to the cost of constructing temporary sheds for the floats and repairing the Coliseum building so that it will be suitable for conventions show that an expenditure of $8,000 would have to be made and the exposition authorities do not feel like putting so much money into a building which will be used for only a few of the very large conventions.  At present it seems that it will be necessary to get along with the auditorium at the grounds and such halls and churches as can be secured downtown.</p>

                            <head type="sub">A CONTRACT WITH HIMSELF.</head>
                            <p>If the executive committee of the exposition proposes to permit one of its members to recommend a contract with himself, and then permit him to carry that contract into effect with himself, it should develop the plan to the limit.</p>
                            <p>A good start has already been made.  For instance, one of the first discoveries made by Manager Rosewater was that he could very profitably rent an office in his building to himself as exposition manager.  The other managers had their offices in the Paxton block, but Manager <choice><sic>Rosewatr</sic><corr>Rosewater</corr></choice> preferred to deal with himself, so he rented an office from himself for himself in the Bee building at $20 per month.  In doing this he is reported to have had a violent debate with himself, but finally agreed with himself as to the terms.</p>
                            <p>When, however, it came to the $3,200 item, Mr. Rosewater had little difficulty in getting together with himself.  He was unanimously of the opinion that it would be a good thing for himself to pay himself $3,200 for advertising the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The only question was whether he would make it $5,000.  His discussion with himself on this point was interesting but brief.  "Why," said he to himself, "should I pay myself more than $3,200 now?  I can make another deal with myself at any time.  This is good for a starter."  So it happens that Mr. Rosewater only recommended expending $3,200 on himself.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee should now make a deal with each of its members for some nice fat contract.  Let the plan be carried to its legitimate conclusion.  Mr. Rosewater might like a concession or two.  Give him the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the grounds.  Let Mr. Reed have something, Mr. Lindsey and the others on the committee.  Carry to its legitimate conclusion and natural end the idea of dividing the swag so happily entered upon in permitting Mr. Rosewater to do business with himself.</p>
                            <p>If the committee follows out this program it will at least be consistent.</p>

                            <p>One of the great questions in exposition matters now is whether the members of the executive committee propose to rest under suspicions raised by their action or whether they will rescind the resolution voting $3,200 into the pockets of one of their members?</p>
                            <p>Another great question in exposition matters is whatever the executive committee proposes to shut of all free advertising heretofore given in western newspapers by subsidizing the newspaper belonging to a member of the committee.</p>
                            <p>Heretofore the public has had confidence in the executive committee.  Such errors as it has committee have been overlooked because errors of judgment are always likely to occur.</p>
                            <p>This, however, is not such an error.  It is an immoral act and a breach of trust for six trustees to vote trust funds into the pockets of one of themselves.</p>
                            <p>If this act stands, confidence falls and the exposition suffers.</p>
                            <p>Every member of the executive committee knows he has done wrong.  Every member knows it was done for Rosewater's benefit, and not for the good of the exposition.  Every member of the committee except one did it reluctantly and only because Rosewater bullyragged it through.</p>
                            <p>Why not reconsider?</p>
                            <p>The exposition can stand the loss of $3,200, no doubt, but the management cannot stand the loss of public confi-<unclear reason="cut off"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">They Are Expected to Look After the Social Functions in Connection with the Great Transmississippi Show.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles has taken up a matter in connection with the social features of the exposition which has heretofore received no attention, but which has an important bearing upon its ultimate success in certain directions.  Up to this time no arrangements have been made for providing for the entertainment of distinguished guests, except such entertainment as would be afforded by a visit to the grounds and participation in the exercises attendant upon the ceremonies which may be held there.</p>
                            <p>The social functions which are a necessary adjunct to the complete success of the entertainment of distinguished guests of the exposition city will be taken in hand at once and an organization effected for formulating plans for this feature of the exposition and carrying out these plans.  The president has determined to call upon the women of Omaha to lend their valuable aid in this work and in order to get the work started he requested authority of the executive committee to appoint ten women as the executive committee of the Bureau of Entertainment.  This authority was granted and President Wattles will make his appointments known within a few days.</p>
                            <p>The Bureau of Entertainment will form an important auxiliary to the Executive department of the exposition.  On this bureau will devolve the duty of providing suitable entertainment for distinguished visitors, especially the wives of the governors and other distinguished dignitaries who will visit the city during the exposition.  This will include the holding of receptions, the giving of dinners and such other social functions as the exigencies of the occasion may seem to require.  The members of the bureau will be expected to hold themselves in readiness to lend their presence at any and all times as may be required for receptions and other events of a social nature and also to throw open their homes for the entertainment of honored guests.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Working on Exposition Music.</head>
                            <p>Musical Director Kimball has spent a busy week after his return from St. Louis, where he entered into negotiations for some strong attractions.  The musical department of the exposition is growing in magnitude and attractiveness every day.  With the orchestra of forty men, direct from Theodore Thomas, and under the directorship of Arthur Mees, Mr. Thomas' assistant, there will be no difficulty in regard to instrumental forces, and this orchestra is assured now beyond doubt.</p>
                            <p>Those who predicted failure in securing an adequate chorus if $5 had to be paid have been incorrect in their prophecies.  The five months of free concerts have loomed up before the musical people, and many have felt that they were receiving the amount of their fee back again from what they learned at rehearsals, not only by reason of the instructions of the conductor, but also on account of the extraordinary opportunity of singing with such a large body of good musicians.  Some of the most prominent local musicians have been at rehearsals and have expressed themselves as pleased and surprised.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kelly, choral conductor, has now announced that owing to the large number of good voices received during the last ten days that at Tuesday night he will state that he will receive just six more contraltos, four tenors and five bassos.  No more sopranos will be accepted for the present.</p>
                            <p>The rehearsals have been open to the public for the last few weeks, but Mr. Kelly has enforced a new rule, which is that no outsiders will be admitted into the rehearsal room, in defense whereof he says that strangers come in and receive an unfair impression of the work if the singers are engaged in extricating tangled skeins of harmony.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Taylor of the Horticulture bureau of the Exhibits department has been interested in learning the effect of the recent cold snap on the fruit trees of this section, as the destruction of the budding crop would seriously interfere with a successful display of Nebraska fruit.  He was especially anxious concerning the peach crop, as one of the events of the fruit carnival is to be a peach day, when the luscious morsels will be distributed free to all comers, and any blight to this crop would be a serious blow to the success of this feature of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A few days ago Prof. Taylor wrote to J. M. Russell of Wymore, Neb., the owner of the largest peach orchard in the state, and asked about the effect of the cold on the peach trees.  A reply to this letter has just been received, in which Mr. Russell says that the frost touched a very few of the buds, but he remarks that it was a good thing for the trees, as there were too many buds coming to assure a good crop of desirable fruit.  He says there will be a very large crop of peaches beyond question.</p>

They say their first duty will be to provide a stopping place for their 250 Chinamen who will begin arriving in Omaha very shortly.  The first bunch, consisting of fifteen or twenty artisans, mechanics and artists, will arrive some time next week, and in the meantime they say a lodging house for them must be found.  Wong Chin Foo, the principal in this exhibit, will arrive in Omaha early next week and the active work of erecting the Chinese building on the bluff tract will commence at once.</p>

                            <p>The Woman's Board of Managers has received a proposition from Miss Helen D. Williams of Nashville, Tenn., to place on exhibition at the exposition a lace handkerchief valued at <choice><sic>$$1,500</sic><corr>$1,500</corr></choice>, and the women are considering the advisability of securing the precious article.</p>
                            <p>The <choice><sic>handkerchiew</sic><corr>handkerchief</corr></choice> has quite a history.  It was made in Neufchatel, Switzerland, about 1850, by two poverty-stricken women whose eyesight was destroyed by the severe strain of the work.  It was intended as a gift to Empress Eugenie, but after its completion is passed into other hands than those of the empress, and was exhibited at the Paris exposition of 1850, and at the London exposition of 1862.  It finally came into the family of Miss Williams, and was shown at the World's fair and at the Nashville exposition.</p>
                            <p>The handkerchief is eighteen inches square and the lace work is said to be of remarkable fineness and delicacy.  In each of the four corners is a small house.  This is out one-quarter of an inch square, but the vines running over the cottage are shown with exactness and the shrubbery about the house is worked out in all the details.  Wild animals in the woods surrounding these houses are perfect in every detail, the hair on the boars and the spots on the leopards being shown with distinctness.  A tropical forest extends entirely around the handkerchief, and numerous wild animals are shown running about between the trees.  <choice><sic>Bananna</sic><corr>Banana</corr></choice> and cocoa trees are shown in full bearing.

                            <p>The Woman's Board of Managers is considering the matter of securing an old manuscript bible as an exhibit in the educational section.  The precious document belongs to the estate of the late Dr. Louis Loewe, member of the Royal Asiatic association, Oriental languages to the Royal College of <choice><sic>Perceptors</sic><corr>Preceptors</corr></choice>, etc.  The date of the ancient manuscripts composing the book is unknown, except in one instance, where it is related that the writer of the text finished his labors in 1496, but the absence of illuminated initial letters leads scholars to conclude that the manuscript is very old.  The book is bound in tortoise shell covers with silver clasps and ornamentation.  It contains 493 leaves and is of the following dimensions:  Seven and three-quarters inches long, five and one-half inches wide and two and one-half inches thick.  The arrangement of the books is different from that adopted for the modern editions of the bible.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Detailed plans for the illumination of the exposition grounds have been completed.  They disclose a comprehensive scheme in harmony with the architecture and surroundings of the exposition.  The general plan is unique in character and unlike anything heretofore done.  This work has been in the hands of Luther M. Stieringer of New York, one of the foremost electricians in this country.  He has been connected with the illumination features of all the great expositions in this country and is known in electrical circles for the magnificent effects he has accomplished in the illumination features of all the great expositions in this country and is known in electrical circles for the magnificent effects he has accomplished in the illumination of beautiful settings.  He is attached to the Transmississippi and International Exposition as consulting electrical engineer and has spent several weeks in this city deciding upon the plans for the illumination of the entire grounds.  Mr. Stieringer was especially captivated with the magnificent opportunity for electrical illumination afforded by the beautiful setting of the main court.  He declared repeatedly and enthusiastically that no electrician had ever been offered the grand opportunities for enchanting effects that are embodied in the arrangement of the buildings constituting this portion of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>No words can adequately convey the beauty of the scene which will open before the visitor to the exposition grounds.  Incandescent lights will form the sole source of illumination in the main court.  The soft glow of these fairy lamps will make every nook and corner, every pillar and pilaster, each arch and dome glow with a soft light, bringing out all the latent beauty of the classic architecture and making the whole scene resemble a dream of beauty.  No cold glare from an arc light will disfigure the scene and add a harsh element to the soft and rhythmic beauty of the picture.  The arc lamps used for illuminating the interior of the main buildings will be so placed that no direct rays from them will pass out of any of the windows to strike the visitor like a discordant note.</p>

                            <head type="sub">OUTLINED IN LIGHT.</head>
                            <p>Incandescent lights will be everywhere.  Each building will be outlined with glowing bulbs.  The architectural features of each classic structure will be emphasized with an array of lights.  Along the cornice, around each window, about the cap of each column and pilaster, outlining each dome and pinnacle, will be seen the electric firefly, its soft glow bringing out the beauty of the architecture of which it will appear a compotent part.</p>
                            <p>Surmounting the posts of the railing around the lagoon will be clusters of the tiny bulbs and neat standards placed near the fronts of the main buildings will support similar clusters, all throwing a radiant glow over the scene.  The bridges across the lagoon, the island in the center, the colonnades between the buildings, all will be outlined with light.</p>
                            <p>A striking feature of the illumination will be the fountain at the west end of the lagoon.  At the base of the west lobe of the trefoil forming the Mirror will stand a handsome column supporting a statue of the water god, Neptune.  This column will be of artistic design, its base being formed of four prows of Norse vessels.  The figure of Neptune will be of heroic size, and the entire decoration will be in keeping with the beautiful and stately Government building, which will form the background for the column.  About the base of this column will be innumerable jets of sparkling water, rising and falling at the command of the sovereign.  Standing guard about these varying forms will be a chain of water lilies, each bud bearing within its petals a bulb, which will glow and flash when darkness covers the scene, keeping watch that none of the sparkling fluid passes out of the confines of the chain.  At night this fountain will be a marvel of beauty.  Beams of varicolored light will bombard it from a hidden source and the glittering globules will assume all the hues of the rainbow at the bidding of Neptune's rival, the god of Electricity.</p>

                            <p>Adding to the enchanting beauty of the scene will be the effects produced by searchlights.  Powerful rays will glance and glitter on surrounding objects, making them stand out in the darkness with startling distinctness.  The beautiful gilded dome of the Government building, surmounted by a gigantic state of Liberty Enlightening the World, will be made to sparkle and glow in the rays of the searchlight like a ball of fire, and other starling effects will be produced in various parts of the grounds by means of the searching rays of these powerful creations of recent invention.</p>
                            <p>The electrical effects in the other parts of the grounds will be exceedingly pretty and every portion will be brilliantly lighted.</p>
                            <p>The illumination of the grounds and buildings will be made on a scale unexcelled even by the effect obtained at Chicago in 1893.  Not less than 2,155 kilowatts in dynamos and transformers have already been ordered from the General Electric company for purely illuminating purposes.  In detail the contract covers four 125 2,000-candle power light brush are dynamos of the multi-circuit type; four 120-kilowatts and two 180-kilowatt alternating current, high periodicity dynamos, operating at 1,040 volts, together with 840 kilowatts in transformers of different sizes.  Current for various power purposes will be supplied from a generator of 225-kilowatt capacity, operating at 500 to 550 volts.  The arc lamps will number 600, of 2,000 candle power each.  These are to be either the double or single carbon type, at the option of the General Electric company, but if the latter are used they are to be arranged for fourteen-hour service.  The contract also calls for the necessary exciters and all the switchboard appliances for the operation of the above machines.</p>
                            <p>Some idea of the size of the dynamos called for may be obtained by comparison with the dynamos called for may be obtained by comparison with the dynamos running at the Nineteenth street power house of the street railway company.  These ponderous pieces of machinery are of 100-kilowatts, 500-volts capacity.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Portland People Head the Movement for State Representation.</head>
                            <p>Henry E. Dosch of Portland, Ore., a member of the Oregon Exposition commission, who visited Omaha recently to make arrangements for participation by his state in the exposition, has imparted to his colleagues a measure of the enthusiasm which he imbibed while in Omaha.  Mr. Dosch is an expert in exposition work, having been at the head of movements in his state for showing to the world the resources of Oregon and the expedition with which he transacted business in Omaha was a proof of his familiarity with the subject.  He came with full power to decide whether his state should take part or not.  He looked over the ground and within twenty-four hours had determined upon the plan and scope of that state's participation, had selected his space in the several buildings, aggregating 6,000 square feet, selected a site for the Oregon building, telegraphed the Portland papers what he had done and started for home.  That he did not rest when he reached home is shown by the reports in the newspapers.  As soon as he reached home a meeting of the Oregon commission was called at Portland and Mr. Dosch submitted his report to his colleagues.  Concerning this meeting the Portland Oregonian has this to say:</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dosch, who will have general superintendency of the Oregon display at the Transmississippi fair, has returned from a flying trip to the exposition city.  He is fully enthused about the fair and when he had made his verbal report to the committee their collective and individual stock of knowledge was greatly increased.  Mr. Dosch, by good luck and friendly assistance, got hold of the best available space left which had been set aside for certain states, but for which contracts had not been closed in time.  Oregon secured the site allowed for Iowa, but as Iowa's representatives did not show up on time the preference was given to Oregon.</p>
                            <p>H. B. Hardt, a former Portlander, now of the Department of Exhibits, had a warm place in his heart for Oregon and was anxious to give this state the best advantages at his command.  Five minutes after Mr. Dosch had conditionally bargained for a desirable site for an "Oregon cabin"&#8212;for headquarters&#8212;and space for the mining display the governor and secretary of state of Iowa walked into the room and announced they would complete the arrangements for Iowa's space.  The feelings of the executive can be better imagined than described when Mr. Dosch informed him that Oregon was to have representation there.  It afforded the executive committee no small amount of satisfaction to ascertain that this state had secured reserve room on the ground floor of the department of mines and horticulture.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dosch said that the Kansas delegation, which came after him, was forced to go up into the gallery for space.  The gallery is not by any means nearly so desirable a place.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee of the state commission has ratified Mr. Dosch's acts at the Omaha fair and has notified President Wattles at Omaha to that effect.  It now remains&#8212;indeed, it becomes incumbent upon the people of the state&#8212;to come to the rescue and back up the commission in its work.</p>
                            <p>The state building, it has been decided, will be a characteristic log cabin.  The place where it will be situated is very central and it will be an excellent spot for the state headquarters.  It is opposite the Horticultural buildings, on one of the main thoroughfares and convenient to the Twentieth street cars.  It is designed to provide the "cabin" with Oregon papers, plenty of Oregon literature and Oregon views.  The cabin, plans for which have already been discussed, will be a unique resting spot.</p>
                            <p>Careful consideration has been given to the question of finances by the committee.  Today a representative body of the commission will start upon a tour of Portland banks to solicit their subscriptions, which will head the list.</p>

                            <p>The exposition grounds continue to present a scene of the greatest activity and the changes which are being made in the general appearance of every part of the grounds are being wrought with great rapidity.  A large force of men is employed in the main court, large gangs being busily engaged in setting electric light standards, planting shrubbery, making roadways, and doing the thousand-and-one things which are necessary to furnish a proper setting for the beautiful buildings which stand out in bold relief on every side.</p>
                            <p>The contractor for the docking about the lagoon has covered each post of the railing with a handsome form of staff and the heavy iron rail between the posts has been painted black.  At the east end of the lagoon a heavy balustrade is being put in place and a coping one foot in width will soon extend all around the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>Work has been commenced on the bridges which will span the lagoon at Twentieth street.  The planking has been torn away from the banks at this point and solid concrete piers will be constructed at each side of the lagoon and at each side of the island.

                            <p>The statuary on the Administration arch is all in place.  This is the first building to be thus adorned and the handsome figures which are seen above the cornice of this building form a striking addition to the appearance of the structure.</p>
                            <p>The calsomining of the interior of the Mines building is well advanced and this building will be entirely completed within a very few days and ready for occupancy.  The staff contractors are cleaning up a few odds and ends about the base of the building and the concrete for the floor of the main entrance is being put down.</p>
                            <p>The contractor, who will calsomine the interior of the other main buildings, is installing his compressed air machine in the Machinery and Electricity building and will commence work at once.  By the aid of these compressed air machines the exposed woodwork of the large buildings will be covered at a very rapid rate with a coat of white paint, giving to the interior a very pleasing appearance and increasing the amount of light to a remarkable degree.</p>
                            <p>It has been decided to gild the dome of the Government building, and Superintendent Farnan opened bids for this work yesterday.  The bids were as follows:  Alexander &amp; Sons, $635; George Moore &amp; Sons, $525; Henry A. Kosters, $448; Henry Lehmann, $176.  These bids were forwarded to Washington for the action of the supervising architect.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Farnan has received instructions to make provision for the handling of two pieces of heavy ordnance, which will constitute a part of the War department exhibit.  There will be two of these guns, one or both being provided with disappearing carriages for coast defense use, and it will be necessary to change the railway tracks at the south side of the grounds in order to unload the guns from the cars to the building, and it will also be necessary to take out a section of the south wall of the Government building to allow the passage of the guns.</p>

                            <p>The Midway is beginning to take on a most animated <choice><sic>apearance</sic><corr>appearance</corr></choice>.  As a rule the structures which will appear along this portion of the grounds are of such character that they may be erected within thirty days, and for that reason little has been done heretofore in this direction, but work has now started and the West Midway is one of the busiest places in the entire exposition.  Lumber and workmen are on every side and within a few days the whole appearance of this part of the grounds will be changed.  Work has been commenced on the Pabst pavilion, the Cyclorama, Shooting the Chutes, the wild west show and Cosmopolis.  In addition to this, work is being pushed on the big Transportation and Agricultural Implement building and the lumber for this covers the ground for a considerable distance on all sides.</p>
                            <p>On the bluff tract there is another scene of bustle and activity.  The viaduct leading from the north tract to the bluff tract is nearly completed and the same is true of the Power plant.  Two more buildings in the Moorish village have been started, the mystic maze and the illusion buildings.  The restaurant buildings at the east end of the main viaduct are growing rapidly and the viaduct is making good progress.

                            <head type="sub">Exhibit for the Exposition is Already Well Provided.</head>
                            <p>Special Commissioner C. E. Llewellyn of the Publicity and Promotion department of the exposition returned Sunday from New Mexico and Arizona, where he went to arouse those sections from the apathy which seemed to have overtaken them.  He met with encouraging success in both territories and says that both of these sections will be handsomely represented at the exposition.  The governor of Arizona appointed a strong commission of representative men and has agreed to ask the legislature to reimburse subscribers to a fund for making a state exhibit.  In this way it is believed that no difficulty will be encountered in raising all the money that is needed.  The magnificent exhibit of mineral and other imperishable articles shown at the World's fair is still intact and is stored in <choice><sic>Phenix</sic><corr>Phoenix</corr></choice>.  This will be augmented by additions in all lines and will make a splendid nucleus which will be shown together with samples of agricultural and horticultural products.</p>
                            <p>A prominent feature of the Arizona exhibit will be a large collection of onyx from a large mine of that precious stone owned by B. Heyman of <choice><sic>Phenix</sic><corr>Phoenix</corr></choice>.  The stone taken from this mine is of exceptional excellence and Mr. Heyman has promised to make a special collection of samples for the state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>In New Mexico Mr. Llewellyn found matters in a somewhat tangled condition owing to the peculiar tactics of the vice president of that territory, who has been running things without the knowledge or consent of the other commissioners.  The difficulty was adjusted, however, and a working organization perfected.  Mr. Llewellyn says that the exhibit made by this territory will be a most creditable one.</p>

                            <p>The conference yesterday between a special committee representing the exposition, Messrs. Kirkendall, Rosewater and Wattles, and a committee from the Building Trades council, Messrs. Breen, Shrum and Bell, resulted in an amicable agreement on all points of difference.  The Building Trades council had charged that the electrical bureau was employing laborers to make the boxes for underground conduits and that the wages being paid electrical workers did not comply with the union scale.</p>
                            <p>After a conference lasting but a short time all differences were adjusted and it was agreed that carpenters should be employed for all work that can be classified as carpenter work, those employed to receive the regular scale for carpenters.  Regarding the electrical workers a compromise was agreed on.  The men who have been employed have been working ten hours and have been receiving $2.25 and $2.50 per day, according to their efficiency.  It was agreed that those working on the outside shall receive $2.50 per day and those working inside shall receive $2.25 per day, eight hours to constitute a day's work, and overtime, not exceeding two hours, to be paid for at the same rate.  The contention of the labor representatives was that these men should receive 30 cents per hour and that eight hours should constitute a day's work.</p>

                            <p>Secretary W. D. Mathews of the Arkansas Exposition commission writes most enthusiastically regarding the progress in exposition work that is being made in his state.  He says the commission is meeting with the most encouraging responses in all quarters to its efforts to arouse the people and secure funds and <choice><sic>maerials</sic><corr>materials</corr></choice> for exhibits and the state will be on time with an extensive exhibit in all lines.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Mathews and George Sengel of Fort Smith visited St. Louis recently and interested the officials of the Missouri Pacific and the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco <choice><sic>railwasy</sic><corr>railways</corr></choice> in the Arkansas exhibit, inducing those roads to join with the state <choice><sic>comisison</sic><corr>commission</corr></choice> in making a fine showing.

                            <p>Mr. Dodge writes that he will have charge of the display made by the Agriculture department, which he says will be one of the finest displays ever made by that branch of the government.</p>

                            <p>Charles Richards Dodge, the special agent of the Department of Agriculture in charge of fibre investigations, writes to President Wattles that he has been granted authority by the secretary of agriculture to loan to the exposition the thirty-two panels in the possession of the department which show all the commercial fibres of the world.  These panels are contained in glass cases and will be shipped in their cases with the other material contained in the exhibit made by the Agriculture department in the Government building.</p>
                            <p>These panels will be displayed in the Agriculture building in connection with the extensive exhibit of commercial <choice><sic>bre</sic><corr>fibre</corr></choice> and fibre machinery which has <choice><sic>ben</sic><corr>been</corr></choice> arranged for.

                            <p>At the conclusion of the reading of the message, Mr. Davis (Minn.), chairman of the committee on foreign relations, amid a buzz of whispered conversation, rose and requested that the findings of the court of inquiry be read.

                            <p>Mr. Lodge, (Mass.) introduced a resolution that 2,000 additional copies of the message, findings and testimony be printed for use of the senate.  The resolution was agreed to.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GETS READY FOR THE INDIAN CONGRESS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Appropriation for the Great Ethnological Exhibit is Anticipated by the Authorities and Preliminaries Are Arranged.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Indian bureau of the Interior department and the Department of Publicity and Promotion of the exposition are actively engaged in working out the details of the Indian congress which is provided for by an item in the Indian appropriation bill, carrying an appropriation of $45,000 for the congress.  Captain W. A. Mercer, U. S. A., who will have direct charge of the congress under the direction of the Indian bureau, will be in Omaha tomorrow to select the ground for the encampment and to consult with the exposition officials regarding the arrangements for this noted gathering of the tribes.  There is every reasonable assurance that the appropriation for the congress will be made and preparations are being made on this theory.  Commissioner Jones is expected to be in Omaha in the near future on business in connection with this congress and other matters of vital concern to the people of this section.</p>
                            <p>A letter which is being sent by Indian Commissioner W. A. Jones to the agent at each Indian agency gives an idea of the manner in which the Indian office is preparing for the greatest ethnological exhibition ever attempted in the world.  This letter has reference only to the permanent encampment of Indians during the entire time of the congress; other details are being considered which contemplate the assembling at Omaha, for short periods, of other features of the congress which are not covered by this letter.  The following is the full text of the letter:</p>
                            <p>There is now pending in congress, as an amendment to the Indian appropriation bill for the next fiscal year, an item authorizing and requiring the secretary of the interior to cause to be assembled at Omaha, Neb., as a part of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held from June 1 to November 1 next, representatives of different Indian tribes of the United States.  An appropriation of $45,000 is proposed to carry said provision into effect.</p>
                            <p>It is the purpose of the promoters of the proposed encampment or congress to make an extensive exhibit illustrative of the mode of life, native industries and ethnic traits of as many of the aboriginal American tribes as possible; to that end it is proposed to bring together selected families or groups from all the principal tribes, and camp them in tepees, wigwams, hogans, etc., on the exposition grounds, and there permit them to conduct their domestic affairs as they do at home, and make and sell their wares for their own profit.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">TO MAINTAIN PRISTINE PURITY.</head>
                            <p>It is represented that the Indian tribes are rapidly passing away or modifying their original habits and industries by adopting those of civilization; that there are yet many tribes within our borders whose quaint habits and mode of life, which have remained poetically unchanged since the days of Columbus, are little known to the majority of our own people; and that an assemblage of the kind proposed would not only be beneficial to the Indians participating, but would be supremely interesting, as well as profitable, to the large body of people in attendance, both by portraying to them the arts and characteristics of savage life, and by showing them the difficulties of the problem confronting the Indian department in its efforts to educate and civilize the Indian.</p>
                            <p>This department is in hearty accord with the plan of holding such a congress of American Indian tribes, and it is the earnest desire of the office, and of the secretary of the interior as well, that the same should be a complete success in every feature.  There is little doubt that the appropriation for the purpose will be made, and as the time left within which to arrange for a creditable exhibit is very short, I deem it most desirable that the preliminary preparations should be commenced at once.</p>
                            <p>The first step will be to select the families or groups of Indians who are to represent their respective tribes at the encampment.  This you will proceed to do without delay, so that the Indians may begin the collection of such articles and materials as they may wish to bring with them.</p>
                            <p>It is desired that the encampment should be as thoroughly aboriginal in every respect as practicable, and that the primitive traits and characteristics of the several tribes should be distinctively set forth.  This point should be constantly kept in view in the selection of the Indians and in the collection of materials.</p>
                            <p>The Indians chosen to attend must be full bloods and should be good types of their respective tribes, consisting preferably of leading men or chiefs and their families.  The latter should be made up of man, wife and one or two (never more than three) minor children.  Should it be impracticable to so select the families as to make the required delegation, several single young men may be included.  In other words, while it is desirable that family groups and family life should be portrayed, it would be preferable that at least a majority of the delegation consist of adults.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CARE IN SELECTION.</head>
                            <p>Only Indians of good morals and habits should be selected and, most important of all, they must be strictly temperate.</p>
                            <p>They should bring native dress, if possible.  They should also bring their native domiciles or the materials with which to make them.  If this is impracticable as to some of the materials, the Indians should know how and be able to construct their dwellings from materials to be furnished on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>They should also bring the necessary articles with which to furnish and decorate their tepees or other domiciles.  As this will be a most interesting part of the exhibit, the furnishings should be as attractive and complete as possible.  The necessary materials for carrying on their native arts should also be brought, so that they may engage in making articles for sale on the grounds.  Where this cannot be done they may bring things illustrative of their craft in reasonable quantities for sale.</p>
                            <p>A collection of implements and emblems of warfare would also be extremely interesting and where it can be arranged with any degree of completeness it is suggested that such collection be brought.  Articles to which a historical interest attaches for any reason should also be brought, if practicable.</p>
                            <p>The Indians will not, of course, be at any expense for transportation to or from the exposition or for expenses of living while in attendance there, and they will be well cared for.</p>
                            <p>It is hoped that your interest in this congress of Indians may be fully enlisted and that the representation from your agency may be thoroughly attractive and typical of the native mode of life and dress of the tribe or tribes.  You will, if necessary, assist the Indians in collecting and arranging the things to be taken to the encampment.  It is felt that the success of the congress must depend, in a large measure, upon your own interest and zeal.</p>
                            <p>This letter is but preliminary, and it is expected that you will proceed without delay to select the Indians to attend and make other necessary preparations.  Captain W. A. Mercer, U. S. A., will have charge of the encampment on the part of this department.  Any inquiry or communication on the subject should be addressed to him at Omaha, Neb.</p>
                            <p>At least one member of the tribe selected should be able to speak English; if necessary, however, a mixed-blood interpreter may be sent instead, to serve, of course, without compensation, although his expenses will be paid as a member of the delegation.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion is in receipt of information from Special Commissioner Bickford to the effect that the legislature of New York has appropriated $7,500 for the use of the New York Exposition commission in participating in the exposition.  This sum is understood to be simply for the incidental expenses of the commission in concentrating the efforts being made in various parts of the state to make exhibits of various kinds.  The commission is reported to be actively at work with every indication that

                            the showing made by New York will be a <choice><sic>representaive</sic><corr>representative</corr></choice> and creditable one.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Bickford will now turn his attention to Rhode Island and endeavor to induce the government of that state to take decisive action.  The governor has indicated a disposition to take action if it is desired by the people of the state and Mr. Bickford expresses confidence that good results may be secured.</p>
                            <p>An agent of the Promotion department will be sent into Maryland and New Jersey to spur those states to action.  Commissions have been appointed in both states, but a little more ginger seems to be required and this will be supplied by a departmental agent.</p>
                            <p>Special Commissioner R. W. Richardson will be sent to California to undertake the awakening of the northern part of the state.  The southern counties, and especially Los Angeles county, are making active preparations for a most extensive exhibit of the resources of that section, including a fine exhibit of minerals.  The Santa Fe railway has offered free transportation over its lines for minerals and a collection is being made.</p>
                            <p>Reports from Los Angeles show that the design for the fruit display of that section of California has been decided.  It will represent an old southern California mission.  The main archway will be surmounted by an elephant made of walnuts.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Suggestion as to How the City May Be Beautified.</head>
                            <p>OMAHA, Neb., April 1.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  I arrived in the city from the east during the course of the state fair last year.  Viewed from the Tenth street viaduct the flags floating from the tops of many buildings presented a most attractive sight.  So much so that nearly every one in the crowd of passengers had some remark to make about it; residents to congratulate each other on the gala appearance of the city and strangers to inquire what the occasion was.  Still, probably not more than one prominent building in five was decorated with a flag.</p>
                            <p>The people who come to the exposition will mostly enter the city by way of the Tenth street viaduct and from that point get a birdseye view of the city.  The first impression is going to be good or bad, and whichever it may be it will take a good deal to wipe out this first impression.  If when visitors enter the city they see flags and banners waving from the tops of all the high buildings, it will be taken by each as a sort of welcome to him or her; while, if the town puts on no external appearance of welcome it is sure to have a depressing effect on the newcomer.</p>
                            <p>One may talk all one pleases about the educational design of the exposition, but the fact remains that the vast majority of the visitors will come for a good time.  The educational effect will be very great, but it will be incidental.  From an artistic standpoint the exposition is going to be the most beautiful ever held.  The design and arrangement of the buildings on the grounds have not been approached in any former exposition, but this will not satisfy the people.  Five or six hours a day at most will be spent there.  The city must put on its holiday garb and keep it on from June to November.  No decoration is so effective, so artistic and at the same time so dignified as flags and banners waving from the tops of high buildings.  Many of the highest buildings in the town are not supplied with flag staves.  Every building of three stories and upwards should float a flag or banner of some king during the exposition.  Nothing will give the visitor such a favorable first impression (and the first impression of the city is of first importance) and nothing will tend more to keep in his mind the idea of a hearty welcome.</p>
                            <p>If anyone has any doubt as to what the appearance would be if such an arrangement were carried out, let him stand on any of our principal streets and imagine a flag waving over every building of three stories and upward, but from no point can as good an idea of the effect be gathered as from the Tenth street viaduct.</p>

                            <p>T. Mizutany is in Omaha in the interests of the Central Japanese Tea association, which is building the Japanese tea house and garden on the bluff tract, east of the Moorish Palace.  This company is supported by the Japanese government and is engaged in introducing Japanese teas in America and teaching their proper uses.  The same company operated the tea garden in Chicago and the Omaha exhibit will be a reproduction of that one.  Everything used in the tea house and garden will be brought directly from Japan, and it is expected that the bamboo, flags, lanterns and <choice><sic>othe</sic><corr>other</corr></choice> materials required will arrive in a short time.  A Japanese curio house will also be operated in connection with this concession.</p>

                            <p>Among the exhibits of minerals to be made at the exposition by Missouri will be specimens of ore from a mine in Madison county which has a peculiar interest just at this crisis in the history of the world.  The mine is the only on in the United States producing nickel and cobalt, both of which are essential in the manufacture of the Harveyized steel used as armor for the battleships of this country, and every such plate used on the vessels of the navy has in it a portion of this product of Missouri.</p>
                            <p>The peculiar feature of the matter, just at this time is the fact that this mine was discovered and opened by the Spaniards when the section constituting Missouri was a part of the Spanish possessions.  It is known as Mine Lamotte, and has been in operation over a century.</p>
                            <p>Citizens of Madison county are urging that the products of the mine be exhibited because its history is coincident with the history of the country which is most interested in the Transmississippi exposition.  Mining Commissioner David T. Day and H. A. Stuckey, chairman of the mining committee of the Missouri commission, have been urged to include specimens from Mine Lamotte in the mining exhibit, and this will probably be done.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commodious Structure Which Will Be Devoted to the Uses of the Working Forces on the Grounds.</head>
                            <p>The architects' drawings for the Service building on the exposition grounds are about completed and will be issued from the office of the architects-in-chief tomorrow.  Bids for the construction of the building will be asked at once and work on it will be pushed.</p>
                            <p>The drawings for this building show a two-story structure, simple and dignified in design.  The architecture is strictly classic and of the Ionic order.  A broad porch will stately columns forms the main entrance.  The building will stand on the west side of Twentieth street, just north of the Administration arch, facing east.</p>
                            <p>The north wing of the building will be devoted to the emergency hospital.  The hospital proper will be on the main floor, with an entrance at the center of the north side, where every convenience is afforded for removing patients brought in by ambulance.  The hospital will be provided with every modern appliance for the care of the sick and will be in charge of a corps of physicians under the direction of Dr. E. W. Lee.  Sleeping apartments for the nurses and attendants, a kitchen, etc., will be located on the upper floor.  The hospital will be closed against communication with the rest of the building, there being no openings in the wall separating it from the other parts of the structure.</p>
                            <p>The lower floor of the main portion of the building will be devoted to offices for the various departments.  On this floor will be the general offices, including the secretary and his office force, the Admissions bureau, the Concessions and Exhibits departments and the Bureau of Public Comfort.  A central rotunda will give light to the interior of the building and afford a means of reaching the upper floor.</p>
                            <p>On the upper floor will be the offices of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Publicity and Promotion.  A large part of this floor will be devoted to quarters for the accommodation of representatives of newspapers and after publications.  Two large, well lighted rooms, with a wide archway between, are set aside for the exclusive use of the "literary fellers."  One room, 77x25 feet, is in the center of the west front of the building, and the other, 39x58 feet, is in the southwest corner.  Both have an abundance of light and ventilation and both open directly from the hallway.  These rooms will be fitted up with partitions extending half-way to the ceiling, and the stalls thus formed will be supplied with desks and other conveniences where the busy correspondents may prepare their copy undisturbed.  Every facility will be afforded for the accommodation of the representatives of the press and the location of the building is especially well adapted for their purposes.  It is almost exactly in the center of the grounds, and is convenient of access from all parts of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ITS RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REASONABLE</head>
                            <head type="sub">For the Opening Day One Fare for the Round Trip is the Maximum, with One-Cent Fare for Nearby Points.</head>
                            <p>CHICAGO, April 4.&#8212;Western roads will meet tomorrow to consider rates for the Transmississippi Exposition, to be opened June 1.  The roads met in that city last Tuesday and Wednesday and appointed a committee to take up the matter.  That committee has prepared a report making the following recommendations:</p>
                            <p>Omaha to be made a regular tourist point for 1898, on the 80 per cent basis, tickets to be sold between June 1 and October 15, with return limit to November 15, from territory east of Colorado common points and Cheyenne at the rate of a fare and a third for the round trip, with a return limit of thirty days; the fare from Chicago to be not less than $20; for the opening day a rate of 1 cent a mile to be made from points from fifty to 150 miles from Omaha; beyond that radius the rate to be one fare for the round trip, holders of all through tickets to be given stopover privileges for ten days upon deposit of ticket with joint agent.</p>
                            <p>Among the passenger officials left in Omaha there is a general feeling of hopefulness that the rates recommended by the local committee for the Transmississippi Exposition will be adopted by the Western Passenger association.  The general meeting of the passenger officials of western lines that is now in session at Chicago will probably continue during the remainder of the present week.  Several other rate matters are to be brought, and it is doubtful if the meeting can dispose of its business before the end of the week.  Among those who are in attendance at the meeting in Chicago are:  John Francis, general passenger agent of the B. &amp; M.; S. A. Hutchison, assistant general passenger agent of the Union Pacific; J. R. Buchanan, general passenger agent of the Elkhorn, and J. O. Phillippi, assistant general passenger agent of the Missouri Pacific, all of this city.  These gentlemen, backed up by the general passenger agents of the other lines entering Omaha, will make a strong fight for the lowest rates to Omaha during the exposition that there is any possibility of securing.  The principal opposition comes from western lines that have no lines into Omaha, but emphasize low rates to Omaha during the exposition that there is any possibility of securing.  The principal opposition comes from western lines that have no lines into Omaha, but emphasize low rates for travel to Kansas City and St. Paul.  It is not believed, however, that this opposition is so great that it cannot be overcome.</p>
                            <p>Said one passenger man to The Bee: "The rates as published in your paper are about the ones that have been agreed upon by the committee.  The report is fuller than your dispatches indicate and goes into the question of the proper scale of rates more thoroughly.  The Omaha delegation will put up a strong fight for its adoption.  There can be no doubt but that the rates are very favorable.  They are much lower than were made for the start of the World's fair, and are upon a more even basis.  Of course, if it should be found that these rates do not move travel the roads will undoubtedly make rates that will do so."</p>

J., has notified the Department of Exhibits that he will occupy two large beds on the bluff tract and will display in one a handsome variety of geraniums and in the other a large variety of rare cannas.  He writes that his display of these two annuals will be very fine and he promises to eclipse anything ever seen in that line in any exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ARCHITECTURAL GLORY IS SHINING.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Finishing Touches on the Exterior Bring Out the Hidden Ideas of the Designers of the Great Temples.</head>
                            <p>The recent wet weather interfered somewhat with the rapid progress which was being made in the main court, but now that the moisture has somewhat disappeared, active work has been resumed in preparing the ground for the finishing touches.  A large quantity of brick has been hauled to the west end of the main court and the paving of the broad promenade which will surround the lagoon will be commenced as soon as the bed of sand is prepared.</p>
                            <p>The staff work on the west colonnades is almost completed and work will be commenced on the elaborate colonnades at the east end of the lagoon.  The carpenters have about finished their work at the east end and the casting of the staff for the colonnades and pavilions is well advanced.</p>
                            <p>Good headway is being made on the Art building, the last one in the main court to be finished.  The interior is plastered, that part of the work having been completed first in order that it might be thoroughly dried before the pictures are placed in it.  A large force of workmen are engaged in putting the exterior covering on the building, and this will be completed within a short time.</p>
                            <p>Remarkable progress continues to be made on the Government building, and the great beauty of the ornamentation of this building is increasing with each addition to the staff decoration.  The wings of the building are practically finished and all work is being concentrated on the central portion of the building and the handsome dome.  The dome is nearly finished and is already a landmark from all parts of town.</p>
                            <p>The statuary for the Agriculture building is being put in position.  The colossal figures of women and sturdy boys make a striking addition to this handsome building.</p>
                            <p>On the bluff tract the Horticulture building is rapidly nearing completion.  Staff Contractor Alexander has a large force of men at work and the elaborate decoration of this handsome building is being rapidly put in position.  The frieze which extends entirely around this building consists of a succession of semi-nude figures of children bearing garlands of fruits and flowers.  The artist who modelled these figures has achieved the most pleasing results.  The wings of the building are about completed and the central mass is being rapidly developed.  The embellishment of this handsome building calls for a large number of groups of statuary and when these are in place the Horticulture building will be one of the most elaborately decorated structures on the grounds.  Architect Beindorff makes frequent visits to the grounds to inspect the building and he is more than pleased with the manner in which the development of the structure is being carried out.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Macadam at Exposition Grounds Torn Up by Ditches.</head>
                            <p>The macadamizing of the walks and drives on the bluff tract is about completed and the cutting of ditches for underground conduits, sowers, etc., has commenced.  A macadam walk is no sooner completed than a gang of men comes along and cuts a ditch across or along it, digging up the macadam which has just been so carefully laid, and mixing the broken stone and gravel with the earth from the ditch.  Electric conduits are now being laid all over the bluff tract.  These are boxes about four inches deep and about eight inches wide.  A ditch a foot wide is excavated for them and these ditches are run "across lots," or directly through the center of a nicely paved walk, regardless of the consequences.  As an example of this kind of carelessness, the broad street passing through the Midway, an avenue fully seventy-five feet in width, had scarcely been left by the heavy steam roller before a gang of electric men came along and excavated a ditch exactly in the middle of the smooth roadway from end to end.  The same thing is being done all over the middle portion of the bluff tract, the laying of these conduits being absolutely necessary to furnish lights to the numerous buildings which will dot this tract.</p>
                            <p>The small sections of the macadam left untouched by the conduit men will be torn up by the sewer gangs.  The Midway sewer on the bluff tract extends the full length of the street on the west side of the paved roadway.  To make connection for the concessions on the east side of the street it will be necessary to run a connection across the paved street.  On the portion of the bluff tract devoted to state buildings the main sewer is in the middle of the broad central avenue.  The only connections that have been made with this sewer for the state buildings are those for the Nebraska and Illinois buildings.  The connections for the other buildings will have to extend across or along one or more of the paved roadways<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The unrest in the business world incident to the war rumours has not had any appreciable effect upon the Department of Exhibits of the exposition.  April 2 the department sent to all prospective exhibitors, whose applications for space had been accepted, a notice to the effect that the last 25 per cent of space money was due and payable at once, under the rules of the department.  Returns from this notice began coming in almost immediately, and in the twenty-four hours ending at 5 p. m., of the 4th inst., there was received at exposition headquarters the sum of $2,082.25 on account of this space charge.  Since that time the money has been coming in at a correspondingly rapid rate, and there has been no indication on the part of any exhibitor to avoid compliance with his agreement.</p>
                            <p>The Exhibits department is beginning to forge ahead in the matter of bustle and activity.  The approach of the time for the gates to open is making the work of the department more burdensome, and it has been found necessary to <choice><sic>increasethe</sic><corr>increase the</corr></choice> office force in order to dispose of the work incident to the closing up of the preliminary details.</p>

                            <p>The station being erected in the main court by the Life Saving service of the government is beginning to assume form.  The building stands just south of the circular colonnade surrounding the Mirror and is opposite the center of the broad pool.  It will be a two-story structure with quarters in the second story for the crew of the station.  The posts for the side wall are in position and the roof is being put on.  The building is a small one, and but little time will be required for its construction.  A mast will be erected about the center of the Mirror to represent the mast of a wrecked vessel, and this will be used to illustrate the practical operation of the life saving service.  A track will be constructed from the door of the station through the colonnade to the edge of the Mirror, and the life boat will be launched from this point.  Exhibitions will be given each afternoon, and these will form one of the most interesting features of the government exhibit.</p>

The southern counties of California are working industriously to make a fine exhibit of their resources, including minerals as well as fruits, nuts, etc., but the northern part of the state has done nothing.

                            <head type="sub">Proposes that Money Left at the End of the Fair Be Used to Assist in Establishing New Enterprises.</head>
                            <p>A scheme to promote the introduction of manufacturing establishments in this city after the exposition and in that way to continue the prosperity which has been started by the big show has been presented to the executive committee of the Commercial club for approval.  After some consideration it has been referred to a special committee for further investigation.  This committee consists of Martin, McHugh, White, Baum and Utt.</p>
                            <p>The plan, as outlined in a report presented by Secretary Utt, provides for the employment in this direction of any moneys which may be in the hands of the exposition directors at the close of the exposition.  The money will form a fund to be handled by some board of governors similar to the exposition directory, to be elected by the stockholders.  If advisable another company may be formed, the exposition subscribers holding stock in it pro rata, according to the amount of their subscriptions to the exposition.  All of this stock shall be nonassessable.  A subscriber will not be compelled to keep his money in the new company.  He will be allowed to draw out his share of the profits if he desires.</p>
                            <p>The plan has not been worked out in detail, but the outline has been given.  It is proposed that the board of governors in charge of the money shall investigate manufacturing enterprises, with a view of inducing them to come to this city.  None of the money will be given as a bonus.  It will be used in buying stock in such establishments, either as a matter of assistance or for the enlargement of the plant.  No money will be invested in any enterprise which has not been thoroughly investigated.</p>
                            <p>The promoters of the plan look upon it as a good scheme of investment and as certain to bring new manufacturing concerns to Omaha.  The need of something of the kind is now being felt.  For example there is at present a good business proposition regarding a flouring mill offered.  The mill is of considerable capacity, but additional capital of $60,000 is required to put it on the desired basis.  About half of this amount has been subscribed by Omaha moneyed men, but the remainder is still lacking.  If there was some such company as the proposed plan provides for the money would be available and the establishment could be secured.</p>

The committee that waited on Mr. Gould consisted of Managers Lindsay and Rosewater and Treasurer Kountze.</p>
                            <p>This contribution by the Missouri Pacific was regarded as very liberal, and the executive committee and all connected with the exposition management were greatly gratified at the announcement.</p>
                            <p>This closes the list of railroads entering Omaha with the exception of the Kansas City, Pittsburg &amp; Gulf road.  The Burlington subscribed $30,000, the Northwestern system, $30,000; the Rock Island, $20,000; the Milwaukee road, $10,000; the Union Pacific $25,000 and the Missouri Pacific $15,000, making a total contribution by the railroads of $130,000.</p>

At that meeting the treasurer will report the exact amount of money in his hands and this money will be the guide in determining the extent of the exhibit.  The commission has issued a notice that it will take no promises but must have the cash in hand.  The money will be apportioned among the several departments of the commission, and no department will be allowed to exceed the amount at its command.  In the meantime every commissioner is endeavoring to raise as much money in his district as possible in order to swell the fund at the command of the commission.  The Missouri commission now numbers 120 members and every section of the state is well represented.</p>
                            <p>The colored members of the commission have been especially active in working among all the people of their race in the state.  Each school teacher and each preacher in the state has been asked to contribute 25 cents to the cause and each pupil and each church member is asked to give 5 cents.  With the fund thus created an exhibit is to be made of everything the colored people have made that is worth showing.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Assurances from Governments and Individuals of More Than the Contemplated Structure Can Comfortable Contain.</head>
                            <p>Arrangements for the foreign exhibits which are to occupy the International building have been completed by the Department of Exhibits and it is now assured that there will be a representative collection, which promises to exceed the capacity of the large building now in process of construction for this purpose.  Extensive exhibits are assured from Mexico, Russia, Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, France, Austria, China, Canada and Great Britain, with still more to hear from.</p>
                            <p>A letter was received by the Department of Exhibits from the minister of agriculture of the Canadian government, expressing the satisfaction of the government with the arrangements which have been made for the Canadian exhibit.  The action of the Department of Publicity and Promotion in sending the resident British vice consul, M. A. Hall, to Ottawa, resulted in arousing the interest of the Canadian officials and an extensive exhibit of the resources of that country is assured.  The Canadian exhibit will occupy 5,000 square feet of space in the International building.</p>
                            <p>The French section will occupy 4,000 square feet of floor space and will include about seventy-five manufacturing firms of Paris and other sections of France.  Frederick Mayer of Paris is the French commissioner and he writes to the Exhibit department that the shipment of their exhibits by the various firms will be commenced at once.</p>
                            <p>The Mexican exhibit will occupy 3,000 feet of space and all arrangements for an extensive exhibit by the Mexican government were concluded some time ago.  The government will have charge of this exhibit and a good showing is assured.</p>
                            <p>The Italian section will occupy 1,000 feet and will be in charge of De Caro Frascollo, the Italian commissioner.  At least forty-two different exhibitors will occupy space in this section and a fine collection of high grade manufactured goods and articles of virtu will be exhibited.</p>
                            <p>The Swiss exhibit will occupy about 600 square feet and displays will be made by about twenty-two firms of manufactures.  Joseph Benno is the Swiss commissioner.</p>
                            <p>One thousand feet has been set aside for the Russian section and Denmark, Austria and Great Britain will occupy space in the building.  A fine showing is assured in each of these sections and the International building will compare favorably with any other display on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese government will be officially represented by representatives and an exhibit, but the latter will be made in a separate building to be erected on the bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Hardt of the Exhibits department declares that the International building is too small to accommodate the great demand which is being made for space for foreign exhibits and must be enlarged.</p>
                            <p>Frederick Mayer, the French commissioner, has notified the Department of Exhibits that he has secured and has ready for shipment forty paintings for the art exhibit, and also <unclear reason="torn"/> the Winged Victory ready for shipment.  Mr. Mayer encloses the application of H. Fromont of Troyes, France, for space in the Manufactures building for an operating exhibit showing engraving on glass.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Captain Ward on the Ground to Look After the Receipt of Goods.</head>
                            <p>Captain H. C. Ward, the army officer who is in charge of the exhibit to be made in the Government building by the War department, and Lieutenant-Commander L. C. Logan, the naval officer who has charge of the exhibit of the Navy department, are in the city.</p>
                            <p>Captain Ward expects to remain in Omaha until after the exposition unless called away by future developments in the Spanish situation.  He will be in direct charge of the shipments of all material for exhibits shipped here by the various governmental departments.  Lieutenant Commander Logan is here temporarily at this time, having came to arrange a few preliminary matters in connection with the Navy <choice><sic>deaprtment</sic><corr>department</corr></choice> exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Captain Ward and Lieutenant Commander Logan both say that the present activity in army and navy circles promises to interfere with the display of both departments.  It has been the intention all along to include in the display of each department modern arms of all kinds, including a 6-inch gun used by battleships and an 8-inch coast defense gun with disappearing carriage, as well as a large number of weapons of offense and defense of smaller calibre.  In the event of open hostilities or a continuation of the present threatening aspect of affairs, these materials will not be shipped to Omaha, and their absence will materially affect the completeness of the exhibits of these departments.  If a peaceable solution of the present crisis is reached in the near future, these weapons will be shipped immediately.</p>
                            <p>The shipment of portions of the government exhibits has been commenced.  A car loaded with material for the exhibit of the Agricultural department is now enroute from Washington, and should reach Omaha about April 12, and another car of exhibits for the same department has been shipped from Nashville, where the material has been stored.  This car should arrive about the same time as the first one, and Captain Ward says he expects the exhibits to continue coming at the rate of two or three cars per week from that time until about May 10.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commissioner of Horticulture Now Making Final Arrangements.</head>
                            <p>Mrs M. A. Shute, state commissioner of horticulture for Colorado, has arrived in Omaha to confer with the exposition management regarding the exhibit to be made by Colorado.  She has direct charge of all matters in connection with the display to be made by the horticulturists of Colorado and has been vested with authority by the other interests of the state to make full arrangements for the entire display to be made by that state.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Shute declined to discuss the probable extent of Colorado's display until after she had concluded her negotiations with the exposition management and had made definite arrangements.  She says, however, it is practically settled that Colorado will make no mineral display, as the $8,000 demanded by Mining Commissioner Lee as an expense fund for making the exhibit had not been forthcoming.</p>
                            <p>It was learned from Special Commissioner Llewellyn, who visited Denver very recently, that the magnificent mineral collection belonging to the state is stored in the capitol building at Denver ready for shipment at any time, but Mining Commissioner Lee says that $8,000 will be required to add to the collection certain material which is lacking and to meet the cost of shipment to Omaha and the cost of installation and care.  Letters to people in various parts of the state failed to bring this money and it is now announced that no mineral exhibit will be made by that state.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MRS. SHUTE LAYS SOME GREAT PLANS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Centennial State to Lead All Others at the Exposition in Variety and Magnificence of Its Exhibit.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Mrs. M. A. Shute, Colorado's commissioner of horticulture, has gone east, after visiting the exposition grounds and making arrangements for a horticultural exhibit, which, she says, will eclipse in the extent and variety of the display anything that may be undertaken by any other state.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Shute spent all of Thursday afternoon at the exposition grounds and only returned to her hotel when there was nothing more to examine.  To Prof. Taylor, superintendent of the Bureau of Horticulture, who accompanied her, Mrs. Shute said, "I can only paraphrase the remark of Senator Gallinger regarding Cuba, 'You may draw any picture of the magnificence and grandeur of your exposition, and I will sign it.'"</p>
                            <p>To a representative of The Bee Mrs. Shute said,  "I was prepared to see a few pretty buildings, and expected them to be white, but I cannot express the amazement and astonishment which filled me when I saw the magnificence and the extent of the preparations which are being made.  I went all over the grounds and made a complete examination of every building.  I have in my mind a bird's-eye view of the whole exposition and I cannot express my pleasure at the promise of a magnificent exhibition, and my regret that my state may not be fully represented in every department of her resources.</p>
                            <p>"'When I left Denver Colonel Bishop, one of the Colorado commission, said the action of the commission would be guided very largely by my advice after I returned.  I can assure you that I shall use all my powers to bring this matter before them in the proper way and urge them to not let this opportunity pass for laying before the people of this great country the advantages we have to offer to settlers.  I regard this exposition as a business proposition which offers to the people of Colorado the best opportunity they have ever had to advertise the resources of that state.  We have plenty of room for more horticulturists in our state and I believe some of the other industries are not overcrowded.  I am convinced that a display at this exposition would result in great good to Colorado and I intend doing all in my power to make the entire Colorado commission and the people of the state see it that way.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">COLORADO'S FRUIT.</head>
                            <p>"I have reserved 1,898 square feet of space in the Horticulture building," said Mrs. Shute with a quiet smile as she mentioned the number of feet; "of this amount the Department of Exhibits has very kindly donated 800 feet.  In this space we will have as fine an exhibit as it is possible to make.  I have completed all arrangements for having the very best specimens of horticultural products collected at our various county fairs and these will be shipped to Omaha.  Our strongest showing will not be made until about September, but we will occupy our space with a fine exhibit of dried and preserved fruits and fresh fruits in their season.</p>
                            <p>"One of the most attractive features of Colorado's horticultural display will be the 'fruit days,' which will be held during the entire season.  We will commence during the very early days of the exposition by having 'strawberry days' on June 9.  On that day the people of Glenwood Springs, a strawberry district in Garfield county, on the western slope, will bring hundreds of crates of the most delicious strawberries the people of this section ever tasted, and these will be given away to all comers.  The next great day will be the Feast of Watermelons on September 3.  Colorado beats the world at raising watermelons and we propose to bring these juicy morsels to Omaha in carloads just to make the people who visit the exposition sorry that they don't live in Colorado.  The people of Grand Junction will come out strong September 9, with their peaches.  There is no place on the footstool which grows such large, juicy, delicious morsels as the Grand Junction district and we will convince everybody within reach of our peach stand that this is a fact.  September 15 and 16 will be our fruit day, and then is the time when the people will have an opportunity of eating their fill of the finest pears and apples grown anywhere in the world.  There will be other varieties of fruit, but the apples and pears will be most in evidence.  It is no uncommon thing for the fruit trees in some portions of our state to produce pears which weigh twenty-seven ounces, and apples measuring seventeen inches in circumference.  I have in my office in Denver photographs of fruit of these dimensions, and can testify that they are not unusual in size.</p>
                            <p>"We are not going to expend all out energies in these fruit days, however," continued Mrs. Shute, "but we will keep our display in the Horticultural building fully up to
                            
                            <pb n="69" xml:id="TMISB04-069"/>
                            
                            the highest standard.  This display will be in charge of men from the western slope and the Arkansas valley who are experts in such matters.</p>
                            <p>"Out state will make a good showing in the educational department and the state department is making extensive preparations in this direction.  The agriculture display will also be a creditable one, and I believe we will have a good mining exhibit.  I intend to use my best efforts to bring about a display of our minerals and believe this can be accomplished."</p>

                            <p>George R. Dean, a Chicago architect who represents the industrial art department of the Central Art association, is in the city to carry out still further the work started by Mrs. T. Vernette Morse, the secretary of the association, who was in Omaha about a week ago.  Mr. Dean comes for the purpose of obtaining definite data on which to base a recommendation as to just the form the display of the association shall take.  These matters have been referred to the department of which Mr. Dean is the head, and he is in consultation with the exposition authorities and architects.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dean stated that it has been definitely decided by the Central Art association to make an exhibit which shall illustrate the artistic furnishing and decorating of a complete American house, according to the most approved artistic principles as an object lesson in the practical application of art education to the home life.  American furnishings will be used as far as possible and arrangements have been partially completed for carrying out this plan.  The only point that is yet undecided is whether the exhibit shall be made in the gallery of the Liberal Arts building, as has been contemplated, or in a separate building to be erected on the bluff tract.  Mr. Dean says a two-story structure is desirable although not absolutely necessary, and this could not be constructed in the gallery of the Liberal Arts building.  He says it is not the desire of the Central Art association to profit by the undertaking in a financial sense, but simply to forward its mission of education by educating the taste of the people.  A number of decorators have offered their services in carrying out the plan, asking that their actual expenses be paid, and several dealers in furnished goods of various kinds have applied for space in the building.</p>

                            <p>Five of the six members of the Kansas Exposition commission arrived in Omaha yesterday and spent the day in visiting the exposition grounds and making arrangements for space for the Kansas building and for the magnificent showing of the resources of the state which is to be made in the exposition buildings.  Those constituting the party were:  John E. Frost of Topeka, vice president and treasurer of the commission; Mayor A. C. Fellows of Topeka, exposition vice president for Kansas; A. H. Greef of Pittsburg, secretary; A. C. Lamb of Wellington, and A. W. Smith of McPherson.</p>
                            <p>The entire morning was spent in visiting the exposition grounds.  Dudley Smith acted as escort for the party and every portion of the exposition ground was visited and thoroughly inspected.  Commissioners Greef and Lamb had been over the same ground about a week before, and they pointed out to their colleagues the site for the Kansas building, directly east of the Horticulture building.  The site is a most desirable one, being but a short distance from the edge of the bluff overlooking the river.  The commissioners were all greatly pleased with it, and they expressed still further satisfaction when they were shown the space in the exhibit buildings which had been reserved for Kansas.</p>
                            <p>The visitors returned to the Millard hotel for luncheon, after which they proceeded to exposition headquarters, where they closed arrangements for the space reserved by Commissioners Greef and Lamb on their former visit.  The total amount of space taken by the commission, aside from the building space on the bluff tract, is 6,000 feet.</p>
                            <p>The commissioners, individually and collectively, said that their state will have an excellent exhibit.  The $15,000 subscribed by four of the railroads has been paid in, and a call has been issued to the people of Kansas by Governor Leedy, asking them to contribute liberally to a fund for a state exhibit, with the understanding that the legislature will reimburse all subscribers at its next session.  This plan was followed in the case of the World's fair, and the commissioners say no difficulty is anticipated in carrying out the same plan in this instance.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Frost, who is land commissioner of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroad, said the prospects for an extensive exhibit are most excellent.  He expressed great surprise at the grand scale on which operations are being carried on at the grounds and confessed that what he had seen had surpassed all his expectations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lamb, who visited the grounds about a week ago on a similar errand, said that he had been surprised at the progress which had been made in the meantime.  He said the commissioners had brought with them a plan for their state building which had been adopted by them.  This plan will be submitted to the architects-in-chief for approval, and contracts for the erection of the building will be let at once.  Mr. Lamb says the people all over the state are greatly interested in the idea of making a fine exhibit of the resources of the state, and he anticipates no difficulty in raising all the money that will be needed.</p>

Carr, president of the State Exposition commission, and also a number of the Board of Trustees of Knox college, that a day be set for a gathering of Knox college men at the exposition some time in September.  The idea, if worked out, would include the reunion of the graduates throughout the northwest, an address by some prominent orator, an excursion from Galesburg of almost the entire body of students in attendance there.  President Finley is considering the practicability of the plan and has talked it over with the local Knox men, all of whom are favorable to it.  President Finley expects to spend some time at the exposition himself, and at the same time bring Knox college into closer relations with the people of this section.</p>

                            <p>The committee of the Oregon Exposition commission, which is traveling about over the state asking the several districts to assist the commission with funds to make an exhibit, is meeting with flattering success.  At Pendleton a few days ago the committee appeared before a meeting of the executive committee of the Commercial club and asked that organization to assist in raising $3,000 for the purpose of making a state exhibit.  The committee took the matter up at once and a public meeting was called at which the matter was started and it is announced that the money will be raised without difficulty.</p>

                            <p>Reports from South Dakota are to the effect that over twenty counties have joined in the movement to assist the State Exposition commission by raising funds for a state exhibit.  The plan is to have each county lend the state commission $200 for each member that county has in the legislature, the understanding being that the legislature is to reimburse the counties at its next session.  The counties are taking up this scheme and it seems assured that a sufficient fund will be available for the work of the commission.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Joint Resolution Instructing the Governor to Name the Men and Prescribing Their Powers is Adopted.</head>
                            <p>Special Commissioner R. W. Richardson reports to the Department of Publicity and Promotion that the Ohio legislature has passed a joint resolution directing the governor to appoint a commission of four persons to "encourage and promote commercial, industrial, educational and artistic exhibits by the citizens of Ohio," and to solicit contributions for the preparation of such exhibits.  The commission is required to serve without pay, and the sum of $3,000 is fixed as the limit of expenditures to be incurred by the commission.</p>
                            <p>Governor Bushnell has announced his intention to appoint a commission within a very few days.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Richardson reports that the interest in Ohio concerning the exposition has been steadily growing and the manufacturers and other lines have manifested a desire to take an active part in the movement to have the state officially represented.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion is greatly pleased at the success of the effort to add Ohio to the list of states which will be officially represented at the exposition, and said that the creation of this commission will give an opportunity for the collection of funds from the large cities in Ohio which have already manifested a desire to take action of this kind, provided joint action could be secured.  With the commission as the head of such a movement it is practically assured that the state will be represented in a manner which will be creditable alike to itself and to the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Casper E. Yost, president of the Nebraska and Iowa Telephone companies, has just returned from an extended trip to Chicago, New York and Boston.  While in the east, he made arrangements for an exhibit of telephone apparatus for the Electricity building at the Transmississippi Exposition here this summer.</p>
                            <p>In speaking of his trip to The Bee he said:  "One finds a great deal of interest in the exposition throughout the east.  It is really surprising the number of inquiries one hears regarding the exposition.  In all the big cities and on the railway trains I heard many inquiries and much discussion concerning it, and there seems to be a general desire to attend and participate in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"The Bell Telephone company has decided that it will exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition a complete set of instruments showing the first telephone inventions that were used, the gradual improvements made, and the later growth and development of telephone instruments.  This, I think, will prove to be one of the most interesting exhibits at the exposition.  The progress made in telephone work from the earliest inventions will be represented by lines and instruments in charge of a competent attendant.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="70" xml:id="TMISB04-070"/>
                            
                            <p>"The long distance telephone people have agreed to place their lines between Omaha and Washington at the disposal of the exposition directory on the day of the opening of the exposition.  Arrangements will be made for through service from the exposition grounds to the White House at Washington, and communication may be had between the officers of the exposition and President McKinley.</p>
                            <p>"The question of putting in a telephone plant at the exposition grounds to render service among the various buildings and from the grounds through our local exchange to outside points will be taken up at once, and in all probability some decision will be reached at an early date.  There is nothing definitely decided about the matter as yet.  The exposition directory and our company will take up the matter at once.</p>
                            <p>"In the exhibit to be made at the exposition, there will be one of the latest and most improved switchboards every built.  At the close of this exposition this switch board will be sent to Sioux City, Ia., and placed in the local exchange there.  A new switch board has also been ordered for the South Omaha exchange, and will probably be put in place there about July 1."</p>

                            <p>The <choice><sic>meting</sic><corr>meeting</corr></choice> of the Council Bluffs <choice><sic>Transmisissippi</sic><corr>Transmississippi</corr></choice> association at the Grand hotel last evening was devoted chiefly to the discussion of the financial problems that have always been inseparable from the deliberations of the association.  President Graham reported that he had received some unsolicited additions to the building fund and that many inquiries had been made by business men and others, which showed a growing interest in the objects of the association.  Dr. Barstow thought the present subscription was worth about $3,000, or could be made to represent that amount of available cash.  Secretary Judson reported that he has experienced little difficulty in making the collections upon the subscription lists given him for collection.</p>
                            <p>Word was sent by the women who have undertaken to assist the association in its work of raising funds that they had practically completed arrangements for giving four entertainments.  The first will be given two weeks from last night.  It will be in the nature of a stereopticon entertainment, showing recent pictures of things in Cuba, accompanied by a lecture.  The name of the lecturer was not given, but it is understood that Mr. Fitch will be the person.  A meeting will be held in the ordinary of the Grand hotel on Saturday afternoon at 4 o'clock to perfect the arrangements for this entertainment.  The next entertainment will occur four weeks hence and will be given by the Rosedale club, a very enthusiastic association of young people who have demonstrated their ability to give a high class show.  The Mandolin Glee club will be the feature of the next show, which will be given in about seven weeks, and the final entertainment of the series will be a "Pottawattamie pow-wow," in which the society young people of the city will take part.  It is believed that this series of entertainments will result in turning into the treasury of the association not less than $1,000.</p>
                            <p>The button question was reverted and the secretary stated that several hundred buttons were in the hands of the juvenile selling committees under the charge of the women, but no reports had been made.  Dr. Barstow thought it would be a good plan to have another committee appointed to assist in this work and at his suggestion George F. Wright was appointed as chairman of such committee with instructions to appoint from the members his co-workers.</p>
                            <p>General Test reported that he had been in conference with insurance companies relative to getting their assistance in helping along the wigwam business and had received favorable replies from a number of them.</p>
                            <p>Applications were presented from the manufacturers of two acetylene gas making devices, offering to light the wigwam free for the privilege of showing their apparatus.  The association will meet again on Monday evening.</p>

                            <p>The machinery for the live fish exhibit to be made by the fish commission in the Government building has arrived and is being installed in a room constructed underneath the floor at the northwest corner of the Government building.  This machinery consists mainly of an ice making plant, which is used for cooling the water in which the live fish are displayed.  The plant is capable of turning out four tons of ice in each twenty-four hours.  In addition to the ice plant there is an electric pump capable of raising 1,200 gallons of water per hour.  This pump is used in connection with the salt water supplied to the tanks for the ocean fish.</p>
                            <p>A large tank having a capacity of 10,000 gallons is being erected beneath the floor of the building near the machinery room.  The salt water will be stored in this tank and the electric pump will raise it to a 1,000-gallon tank placed above the fish exhibit, from whence it will pass through pipes to the glass tanks containing the fish.  About 100,000 gallons of salt water is used per day, the water being made to pass through the circuit of tanks again and again, passing through a filter after leaving the fish tanks, in order to remove all foreign matter, and being charged with air before reaching the fish tanks again.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit of salt water fish will contain many different varieties.  About the time the fish are wanted a vessel of the fish commission will make a special trip to some point along the Atlantic or gulf coast to be hereafter determined and a big seine will be let down into the depths.  When it is hauled in its contents will form the major portion of the exhibit of salt water fish at the exposition.  No one can foresee what monstrosities this haul may include.  There may be a large proportion of freaks of nature, or there may be an utter absence of unusual forms.  At any rate, there will be a variety of salt water fish which will form a source of amusement and a means of information to exposition visitors.</p>
                            <p>Ten tanks are set apart for the salt water fish, and in addition to these there will be shown the apparatus and the methods used by the department to propagate cod and one or two other varieties of salt water fish, with the plant in full operation.</p>
                            <p>No machinery will be required for the tanks of fresh water in which will be shown the various varieties of fish which inhabit the fresh water streams and lakes of this country.  There are fifteen of these tanks, and the water will be supplied to them from the city mains, after passing through cooling coils and filters.  In addition to the fifteen tanks there will be two large, oval pools, each about thirty inches deep and about ten feet in the long diameter.</p>
                            <p>A number of stuffed figures of sea lions, seals and other specimens were received at the Government building in the same car with the machinery, and these will be placed in position within a few days.</p>

Although the lagoon has been drained of all its water, the excavation made for the piers fills constantly with water, and it seems impossible to make a footing for the piers.  The temporary wooden bridge on the north side of the island is directly in line with the permanent bridge and it is being removed, thus cutting off all communication between the sides of the lagoon except by passing around either end of the long basin.</p>

Mr. Kimball was considerably elated over his success in securing this organization, as it is regarded as one of the best musical organizations in the country.</p>
                            <p>During a recent visit to St. Louis Mr. Kimball met the management of the St. Louis Apollo club and negotiations were opened looking to the appearance of this organization at the exposition.  The St. Louis club is composed of about eighty men, all singers of a high order, and it ranks very high among the musical organizations of the country.  Mr. Kimball says the management of the club expressed a desire to have the organization visit Omaha and the exposition and it is expected that arrangements for their doing so will be concluded in the near future.</p>
                            <p>An exposition chorus book is being prepared by the Musical department.  It will be issued at once and will probably be placed in the hands of the members of the chorus within the next ten days.  The book will contain twenty choruses covering a wide range of selection.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Calfornian Arrives and Has a Novel Scheme.</head>
                            <p>C. H. Holbrook, jr., of San Francisco is in the city for the purpose of making final arrangements for a novel exhibit which he proposes to install in connection with the Mining building.  This exhibit will be an exact reproduction of a gold mine.  The upper works will be installed in the gallery of the Mines building and here will be shown the machinery which is used to the operation of a gold mine, including air pumps, water pumps, elevators, etc.  The visitor will enter the elevator and the car will descend rapidly, the mechanism being so arranged that the visitor will think he is going down an immense distance.  At the 500 foot level the car will stop and a small gallery will be seen where a gold miner is at work digging the precious ore.  Leaving this the car will descend another 500 feet, where the visitor will alight at the bottom of the shaft.  Here will be side galleries and all the other ramifications of a well worked mine where the visitor may roam for hours.  The earth beneath the exposition grounds will be honeycombed with these passages, illustrating the various processes of mining, and guides will be in attendance to explain the purpose of the various appliances.</p>
                            <p>Some time will be required to construct this elaborate exhibit and Mr. Holbrook is here for the purpose of getting the work started.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Governor Urges Citizens of the State to Make an Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>Special Commissioner R. W. Richardson returned yesterday from a trip to Indiana and Ohio in the interest of the exposition.  He reports that a great deal of interest is being manifested in both states regarding the matter of state participation in the exposition.  In Indiana, especially, a great interest has been aroused and Governor Mount has given notice of his intention of appointing a state commission of about fifteen or twenty members.  Before Mr. Richardson left Indianapolis Governor Mount gave him the following document:</p>
                            <p>"EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 30, 1898.&#8212;Hon. R. W. Richardson: Dear Sir&#8212;You are authorized to say to the managers of the Transmississippi and International Exposition that in pursuance of action taken in my office this day I will immediately appoint a commission to represent Indiana at your approaching exposition.  The people of this commonwealth wish for you abundant success.  Very truly,</p>
                            <ab>"JAMES A. MOUNT, Governor."</ab>
                            <p>Mr. Richardson says there is no legislative appropriation in Indiana, but the governor was so strongly impressed with the benefits which will accrue to the state from having an exhibit that he has agreed to ask the next legislature to reimburse contributors to a fund to enable a showing to be made.  With this arrangement, Mr. Richardson says, the people in all parts of the state feel that a considerable sum can be raised without difficulty and an excellent showing made.</p>

                            <p>A request for exposition postage stamps has been received by Secretary Wakefield from a school boy in England.  The letter is dated "The Park, Harrow-on-Hill," a school town not far from London.  The letter is as follows:</p>
                            <p>"I am an American boy staying in England.  Could you send me some of the exposition postage stamps, used or unused?  I have heard that they are very pretty.  All of the boys here are trying to get them.  They had hardly heard of Omaha until the stamps came out."</p>
                            <p>The letter was written in a straggling, school-boy hand and was signed "L. W. Bates, jr."  Carefully pasted on the sheet below the letter was a 10-cent stamp and eight 2-cent stamps, all United States stamps, presumably in payment for the exposition stamps.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield notified the youthful collector that the exposition stamps are not yet issued, but promised to keep his letter at hand and forward a set of the stamps as soon as they are issued.</p>

Several engines managed to flounder to that part of the grounds, the driveways being in bad condition, but their assistance was not needed, as no property was endangered by the fire.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Chase Writes Briefly to the Department of Exhibits Concerning the Plans for Hawkeye Participation.</head>
                            <p>The first communication received by the exposition management from the Iowa Exposition commission since the passage of the bill appropriating $25,000 for a state exhibit was received yesterday by the Exhibits department.  This communication was a letter from Secretary Chase, dated at Cedar Rapids, Ia., and was very brief.  It stated that the Iowa commission still has about $5,000 of the preliminary appropriation of $10,000, which, with the $25,000 just appropriated, gives the commission a fund of $30,000 with which to make an exhibit.  The secretary says the commission is actively at work and will be prepared with an exhibit when the exposition gates are opened.  Architects are now at work on the plans for the state building, and Secretary Chase says the contract will be let just as soon as the drawings can be made and bids asked, probably within the next ten days.</p>
                            <p>Up to this time Iowa has applied for very little space.  No formal application of any kind has been made for any space, nor has any written request for space been made.  When a delegation of the commissioners visited Omaha about a year ago they made a verbal request that 1,200 square feet of space in the Agriculture building, 1,200 feet in the Horticulture building and one of the most desirable spaces for a state building on the bluff tract be held in reserve for Iowa.  This space has been held in accordance with this unofficial request on the part of individual members of the commission, notwithstanding the clamors of numerous state delegations, which were ready and anxious to take the space and pay the full price for it.  The space reserved in the Agriculture and Horticulture buildings by Iowa is very small, compared with the space which will be occupied by other and less important states, but the demand which has been made for space in these and all of the other main buildings will preclude any additional space being granted, unless it be in the galleries of the buildings in the main court.</p>

                            <p>The pile driver being used to drive piles for the foundation for the piers to support the permanent bridges across the lagoon at Twentieth street took a tumble into the lagoon yesterday.  The machine, which includes a "donkey engine" on a broad platform and a tall, derrick-like arrangement technically known as "the leads," in which the heavy hammer travels up and down, was standing on the southern edge of the island.  The machine lost its balance and toppled over into the empty bed of the lagoon, smashing the "leads" and disabling the engine.  The smokestack of the engine was mashed and broken and the platform was torn loose.  A pile driver operated by a horse was obtained and the work of driving piles proceeded, a derrick being sent for to raise the steam driver and apparatus out of the lagoon.  No one was hurt by the accident.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Morse Consults with the Woman's Board of Managers About a Prospective Educational Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>Mrs. T. Vernette Morse of Chicago, executive secretary of the Central Art association, is in the city for the purpose of making arrangements for an exhibit which will be unique and attractive in its nature and a new departure in exposition displays.  The Central Art association is a national organization whose purpose is to promote the love of the artistic among the people of the nation; to interest the public in the importance of educating the hand to execute what the mind has conceived; to acquire a knowledge of the properties, capabilities and value of raw material and its possibilities as a means of artistic expression, and to do a host of other things which the members believe will result in elevating the taste of the people.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Morse has come to Omaha to arrange for an exhibit to be made under the direction of the association, which shall be educational along the lines covered by the plan of organization of the association.  She is conferring with the officers of the Woman's Board of Managers regarding the matter.  The plan outlined by Mrs. Morse contemplates the occupancy of a space of about 1,500 feet in the Liberal Arts building.  In this space she proposes to establish a house, either dividing the space into appropriate rooms or erecting a building.  The rooms will be furnished in the most artistic manner.  This does not imply that the furnishings will be elaborate or expensive.  Mrs. Morse takes especial pains to impress upon her hearers that the object of the association is not to educate people in the desire for expensive things, but rather to instill into the public mind a knowledge of how to distinguish between the artistic and the crude.  Nothing will be admitted to this house unless it is made in an artistic manner and put together in a substantial and workman-like way.  The furniture will be artistic and complete harmony will exist between the many articles of furnishing which will be installed in this model house.</p>
                            <p>The members of the Woman's board, who have been consulted in the matter, are inclined to look with great favor on the scheme and some of them express the conviction that its execution will mark the beginning of a new era in expositions and raise them above the level of commercial exhibitions or county fairs.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sings from the Stage and His Companions Pronounce it Good.</head>
                            <p>The exposition auditorium has been dedicated and pronounced perfect by a board of experts.  This may be surprising news to the exposition officials and those having direct charge of the auditorium and of the music of the exposition.  To the Bostonians belongs the credit of giving the first performance in the handsome structure.</p>
                            <p>It all happened this way:  When H. C. Barnabee began his career as the head of a traveling musical organization Colonel D. H. Elliott was his manager.  Colonel Elliott is now a resident of Omaha and is a special commissioner of the Transportation department of the exposition.  He invited Mr. Barnabeen and several other members of the Bostonians company to visit the exposition grounds and they quickly made up a party.  When the grounds were reached the members of the party were simply overwhelmed with the magnificence of the preparations being made for the great transmississippi fair.  They could scarcely  express their astonishment at the magnitude of the scheme and the beauty of the entire grounds and buildings.  They visited each building and inspected it with minute care, all the while reiterating their astonishment at finding such <choice><sic>magnificenc</sic><corr>magnificence</corr></choice> and evidence of enterprise in the west.  Some of the women of the party succeeded in smuggling kodaks into the grounds in spite of the watchfulness of the gatekeepers and snapshots at several of the buildings were taken as mementos of the visit.</p>
                            <p>All this time Colonel Elliott had a scheme "up his sleeve" and he guided the party into the Auditorium.  The huge structure has been finished inside and is ready for painting, but piles of debris are in evidence at many points.  The sight of the stage was all that was needed to round out Colonel Elliott's plan and Mr. Barnabee took possession of the wide platform, telling the others in the party to distribute themselves over the house while he warbled.  This was quickly done, and then Mr. Barnabee sang "Palm Branches."  As he finished the others applauded and all declared that the acoustics of the building were most excellent, even the emptiness of the house having no perceptible effect.  Mr. Barnabee sang a few more snatches and was joined by Marie Stone, who sang several short snatches from familiar works.  Others of the party joined in and an impromptu concert was held for a few moments, all joining in praising the excellence of the place for musical and oratorical purposes.</p>
                            <p>After passing upon the excellence of this structure the party visited other portions of the exposition grounds and were loud in their praise of the exposition and everything connected with it.  Each member of the party voluntarily offered to become a walking advertisement of the exposition and to come with all his friends to see the show.</p>

These data include figures as to the number of rooms in the house, the number of people who may be accommodated in addition to the regular guests, the regular rates for room or board or both and whether these rates will be changed during the exposition.</p>
                            <p>It has been nearly a week since these letters were sent out and up to this time, with one or two exceptions, the leading hotels in the city have not made any reply.  Chairman Dudley Smith says a second letter will be sent out at once, urging all to reply to these questions who have not already done so.  He says this information is absolutely necessary in order to conduct the Information bureau along intelligent lines.</p>
                            <p>A few of the replies which have been received indicate that the regular rates now in force will be increased within the near future.  In reply to the question, "Will the rates remain the same during the exposition?" these replies contain a vigorous "No."</p>
                            <p>Chairman Smith says he will not commence making a canvass of the city until about May 1, as he believes that a great many people will change their residences about that time, and a canvass before that time would be worthless.  Early in May he says he will put on a force of men and have a careful <choice><sic>housce-to-house</sic><corr>house-to-house</corr></choice> canvass made for the purpose of securing a complete list of all places where board or lodgings may be had.  He has been <choice><sic>correspondin gwith</sic><corr>corresponding with</corr></choice> those having charge of similar bureaus in former expositions, and is culling from their replies the data which applies to Omaha in order to profit by the experience of these officials.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Nebraska Press association is holding a meeting in Omaha for the purpose of seeing what arrangements are being made by the exposition management for the accommodation of the members of the fraternity.  This committee consists of Editors Simmons of the Seward Reporter, Dayton of the York Republican, Bowlby of the Crete Democrat and Saunders of the Columbus Argus.  The committee visited the Nebraska building at the exposition grounds in company with Major Clarkson, but the members were unable to determine just which room in that building had been set aside for their association.</p>
                            <p>The committee passed a resolution, which will be laid before the executive committee of the exposition, asking that headquarters for the newspaper representatives be supplied on the grounds.  The committee also waited upon Manager Kirkendall and had a short talk with him upon the question of accommodations and admission to the grounds.  Mr. Kirkendall agreed to lay the whole matter before the <choice><sic>xecutive</sic><corr>executive</corr></choice> committee at once and promised early action on the matter.</p>

                            <p>The Odd Fellows of Omaha, South Omaha and Florence have joined in a movement to establish an information bureau for the benefit of visiting members of the order who may be in the city during the exposition.  A building will be erected on Fourteenth street between the Odd Fellows' temple at Fourteenth and Dodge and the Hall association building immediately north of it, and in this will be established a committee of members of the order who will be ready at all times to care for the needs of visitors.  In addition to the information bureau, the parlors of the temple and the rooms in the Hall association building will be open at all times and these will be supplied with stationery and reading matter for the entertainment of any who wish to avail themselves of the opportunity to rest and refresh themselves.</p>

This band stand will stand at the east side of the grand plaza, opposite the viaduct leading from the main court to the bluff tract.  The design for it has not yet been completed, but it has progressed far enough to make it certain that the structure will be a very handsome affair, resembling the proscenium arch and stage of a theater, although the arch and the back portion of the stage will be of a most peculiar shape, designed to act as a sounding board and throw the sound towards the people.</p>

                            <p>very unique exhibit is being prepared under the direction of the New Mexico Exposition commission.  When completed this exhibit will be a model, in clay, of the city of Albuquerque, N. M., as it was fifteen years ago, showing its quaint adobe houses and the methods of life of the inhabitants.  In contrast to this will be the Albuquerque of today.  This work will be done by Mrs. J. N. Vogelgesang and her daughter, Mrs. Idalia Perkins.  These women made similar models of New Mexican towns for the World's fair, which attracted great attention.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SUNFLOWER STATE WHEELS INTO LINE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Governor Leedy Names a State Commission with Instructions to Proceed at Once with All Necessary Arrangements.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Kansas has an exposition commission and there is no longer any doubt about the resources of that state being represented in the exposition in the most creditable manner.  Governor Leedy has appointed a commission of five members and the railroads have contributed $15,000 toward a fund for a state exhibit.  An equal amount will be raised among the people of the state and a state building will be erected and exhibits made in the various main buildings.</p>
                            <p>The commission was appointed by Governor Leedy Tuesday, consisting of the following members:  Former Governor George W. Glick of Atchison, A. W. Smith of McPherson, John E. Frost of Topeka, A. H. Greef of Pittsburg and A. C. Lamb of Wellington.  Governor Leedy notified these appointees to meet in Omaha today and organize for business, making their arrangements for space on the spot and acquiring all necessary information at the outset.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with these instructions Mr. Greef came to Omaha and at once made himself known at exposition headquarters.  He said the other members of the commission would arrive at once and the organization of the commission would be effected at once.  He made a flying trip to the grounds in the morning and returned there in the afternoon in company with Major Clarkson.  After the first trip, although not able to go through the main court on account of the mud, Mr. Greef was most enthusiastic regarding the outlook for a big exposition and was very emphatic in his declaration that his state will be represented in a manner which will be a credit to both the state and the exposition.  Mr. Greef is secretary of the Commercial club of Pittsburg and intends to devote all of his time to pushing the work of the commission.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DETERMINED TO SHINE.</head>
                            <p>"We are going to have a state building," said Mr. Greef, "and we will have a good exhibit in the main buildings.  Our state building will be mainly for headquarters and offices and our exhibits will be placed in the main buildings.  Our commission has not had a meeting, but some of the details have been talked over in a general way by the governor and he is strongly in favor of having a state building where our people can gather.  The $15,000 which has been contributed by the railroads will be augmented by a similar amount to be raised among our people.  I do not believe there will be any particular difficulty in raising this amount and an effort will be made to have the legislature reimburse the contributors.</p>
                            <p>"Our exhibits will be in the Mining, Agriculture and Horticulture buildings.  We have very large mineral interests in the southeastern part of the state which will be well represented and our extensive agricultural and horticultural interests will be represented in a very creditable manner.  The plan which has been considered is to divide the state into districts and give each member of the commission full charge in his district.  In this way we will accomplish a good deal in a short time.  Our people in the southeastern part of the state have been awake to the importance of being represented at this exposition and there will be no delay in that section of the state.  We realize that the exposition is gong to be one of the greatest affairs of the kind ever held in this country and of great importance to all the people of the west.  We will make a big showing and our people are coming to the show in large numbers.</p>
                            <p>"I was prepared to see some extensive preparations at the grounds, as I have been receiving large amounts of advertising matter from the Publicity department of the exposition, but I must confess that I was greatly astonished when I saw the buildings themselves.  I took it for granted that the pictures sent out were somewhat flattering, but I find that they do not convey an adequate impression of the reality.  The main court is a thing of great beauty and the effect of the grounds is going to be most magnificent."</p>

                            <p>The exposition management has concluded all arrangements for furnishing meeting places for the numerous conventions and meeting of various kinds which will convene in Omaha during the coming summer and Major Clarkson says that ample accommodations will be afforded all comers.</p>
                            <p>The large gatherings, such as the meeting of the National League of Republican Clubs and the meeting of the delegates enroute to the annual meeting of the Christian Endeavor society, and the annual meeting of the Travelers' Protective association, will be held in the Creighton or Boyd theater.  Boyd's has been secured for the traveling men May 31, and for the Republican League meeting June 28, 29 and 30.  The Creighton has been secured for the Christian Endeavor meeting July 3.  The congresses and the smaller meetings will be held in Creighton hall or some of the numerous smaller halls down town, several of which have been secured for that purpose.  In the case of gatherings too large for the theaters down town, the Auditorium on the exposition grounds will be utilized.  This has a seating capacity of about 4,000 and will hold many more by filling the lobby.</p>
                            <p>In this way Major Clarkson says that there will be no difficulty in caring for all of the meetings.</p>

                            <p>The Cozad Irrigation company has made a formal application for 180,000 square feet of space in the irrigation field on the north tract, on which it proposes to construct a relief map of Dawson county, showing the rivers and waterways of the county and the plant and ditches of the irrigation company.  In this space will be established a number of orchards and fields showing the practical operation of irrigation.</p>
                            <p>The latest accession to the group of buildings on the bluff tract is a handsome structure to be erected by the Bemis Omaha Bag company.  The building will occupy a very sightly location at the west side of the bluff tract, directly east of the Auditorium building.</p>

                            <p>Manager Babcock of the Transportation department has completed arrangements for the freight warehouse on the exposition grounds and plans for the building will be completed in a few days.  The warehouse will stand at the extreme northeast corner of the north tract and will be reached by a switch from the main line of the Missouri Pacific.  Engineer Bush of this road has located this switch and it will be laid as soon as the material can be placed on the ground.  This same switch will also serve as a means of getting into the Transportation building with the locomotives and trains of passenger cars which will form some of the exhibits in this building.</p>

Leo Bonet has the contract for this building and he received these instructions from Vice President Sutherlin.  The material was already ordered, the contract having been made before Mr. Sutherlin left for home last week, and no time will be lost by Mr. Bonet in getting started.

                            <head type="sub">Appropriates Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars for the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The telegram announcing that the Iowa legislature had appropriated $25,000 for the erection of a building and for delaying the expenses of a state exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, was received with considerable satisfaction in this city, especially around exposition headquarters.  All along there had been a feeling that when the time came, Iowa would do the right thing by the exposition, but there were some who feared that the legislature would put the matter off until the last minute and that then it would be so late that the state could not be represented in a creditable manner.</p>
                            <p>The fact that the legislature has appropriated the sum of $25,000 put Iowa well up in the front ranks of transmississippi states, this sum being exceeded by only Nebraska, which appropriated $100,000, and Illinois, which appropriated $45,000 for a building and an exhibit.  With the appropriation that has just passed the legislature, Iowa will have the sum of $35,000 available for a building and an exhibit, the sum of $10,000 having been appropriated by a former legislature.  With the money now available, the Iowa commissioners will begin active operations and will have the building and the exhibit ready for the opening day of the great show.</p>
                            <p>While the Iowa commissioners have done little in the way of preparing to build, they have gone so far as to secure plans for the state building and now they will advertise for bids at once.  They expect to award a contract within the next fifteen days and begin work upon the building immediately thereafter.  They have made considerable headway in securing an exhibit, having already worked up an interest among the farmers, manufacturers and business men of the state.  In addition to this, they have the exhibit that was displayed at the last state fair and much of the exhibit that was shown at the World's fair.  With this and what they can gather within the next sixty days, it is certain that the state will be represented in a manner that will be satisfactory to the residents of the great commonwealth.</p>
                            <p>The site for the Iowa building was selected months ago and has been held by the exposition managers, they believing that the legislature would make a good sized appropriation.  This site is regarded at the choicest upon the grounds.  It is located just west of the Nebraska building, facing the grand plaza, surrounded by large trees and flowering shrubs.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Vice President of the Exposition Awakens Great Enthusiasm.</head>
                            <p>Vice President Sutherlin of Montana is arousing the people of his state to the pitch of enthusiasm reached by him during his recent visit to Omaha and is quoted at great length by the local papers.  A recent issue of the Helena Independent contains a column interview with Mr. Sutherlin, in which he speaks in the most enthusiastic terms of the exposition and the many benefits which Montana will gain by the exhibit which will be made.  In this connection it may be noted that a check in full payment for Montana's space was received yesterday at exposition headquarters in this city.</p>
                            <p>Among other statements made by Mr. Sutherlin in the interview printed in the Independent is the following:  "Space is in great demand at the exposition.  The people of the east are awakening to an appreciation of the importance of the exposition, and double the space available could be disposed of before the exposition opens.  I could have sold the space assigned to Montana in the Agricultural building for $5 a foot, such is the demand for more room.  Some of the states were indifferent and slow, but now they're running to get lots for their state buildings and space for exhibits, and already the space in some of the buildings has all been taken.  This is especially the case in the Agricultural building.  This is one of the largest buildings, about 90x700 feet, with a thirty-foot gallery all around, and every foot of the main floor has been allotted, while some of the states have had to go into the gallery.</p>
                            <p>"The rapid advance made by the exposition management during the last three months is ample assurance that the exposition will be ready to open June 1.  A person must see the work that is going on there before he can appreciate the immensity of the enterprise.  The success of the exposition is assured.  The interest in it is increasing every day.  I am satisfied that Montana will be benefited for the money expended on its behalf and I feel sure that every dollar will be put where it will bring the best results."</p>

                            <p>Garbagemaster MacDonald has notified the exposition authorities that he has the sole right to haul away the garbage and all offal from the exposition grounds, and serves notice that he proposes to protect his rights by not allowing any other person to do any hauling.  As there will be a very large quantity of garbage to be disposed of the exposition authorities are estimating the cost of disposing of it at the enormous figures contained in the remarkable contract between the garbage contractor and the city.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Preparations <choice><sic>eBing</sic><corr>Being</corr></choice> Made for Its Decoration in Colors.</head>
                            <p>Preparations are being made for commencing work on the interior decoration of the Government building.  A force of decorators from Washington is now enroute to Omaha, and these men will commence work on the building as soon as they arrive.</p>
                            <p>The main walls of the building have been covered with sheathing and will not be plastered.  The sheathing will be covered with maroon colored burlap with black bands at the top and bottom of appropriate design.  On this background a decoration of white and gold will be painted, forming a beautiful setting for the various exhibits.  The national colors will be used freely in the decoration, and those who have seen the designs for this work declare that the effect surpasses any former attempt made by the government at any exposition.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Farnan has been in consultation with the exposition management regarding the <choice><sic>moivng</sic><corr>moving</corr></choice> of the railroad tracks at the south side of the main court nearer to the Government building in order to facilitate the handling of the heavy ordnance which will form a part of the exhibit to be made by the War department.  There will be two heavy guns in this exhibit, one a six-inch and the other an eight-inch gun.  These toys, with their carriages, will weight thirty-eight and forty-two tons respectively.  Superintendent Farnan has asked the exposition management to have the south railway track moved to within forty-five feet of the south door of the Government building, to which point he proposes to construct a heavy platform for hauling the guns into the building.</p>

                            <p>In order to get the guns into the Government building it will be necessary to take out a section of the south wall on either side of the south doorway and replace it after the guns are in position.  Arrangements have been made for doing this.</p>
                            <p>The government exhibits are not expected to arrive until about May 1.  But a short time will be required for installation, as all preparations are being made before the exhibits are shipped and the assembling of the various parts is the work of but a short time.  The government exhibits have always been ready on time at every exposition and there has been no indication that this exposition will be any exception to the rule; on the contrary, everything has been moving with the greatest speed and nothing has occurred to indicate the least hitch in the program.</p>

                            <p>HELENA, Mont., March 29.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The recommendation of Commission Southerlin that Montana should have a building at the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha have met the approval of Governor Smith and the other members of the commission.  Governor Smith said today:  "We have decided to follow Mr. Southerlin's recommendations.  I think that about $4,500 will be spent on the building.  That amount judiciously expended will give us a commodious structure.  From what Mr. Southerlin said it was very apparent that the state should have a building.  The commissioners all favor it."</p>
                            <p>This will be welcome news to Montanans who are anxious to have the state make a good showing at Omaha in a modest way without lavish expenditure, as was the case at the World's fair.  The first load of Montana's exhibits, consisting of a very fine collection, left yesterday in a special car over the Great Northern road.  Shipments hereafter will be made at regular intervals.</p>

The last issue of his paper might almost be designated an Omaha edition, as this city was brought into such prominence.  In the first place there were several pages devoted to a careful and very full report of the doings of the lumbermen of Nebraska at their recent meeting in this city, and several more pages descriptive of the Nebraska lumbermen's excursion to the northern mills.  Considerable space was also given to a description of the exposition, full page engravings accompanying the descriptive matter.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Governor's Agent Gets Ocular Evidence of Exposition Greatness.</head>
                            <p>D. M. Parry of Indianapolis is in the city as the representative of Governor Mount of Indiana, who sent Mr. Parry here to make a personal investigation of the exposition situation and report whether the roseate stories told in that state by emissaries of the exposition are based on fact or are mere figments of a vivid imagination.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Parry visited exposition headquarters yesterday afternoon and made his errand known to Major Clarkson and Secretary Wakefield.  The latter showed the Indiana investigating committee a statement showing the financial condition of the exposition and contracts and other evidence of what had been done.  The magnitude of this showing surprised Mr. Parry, who admitted that it showed that operations were being conducted on a much larger scale than he had supposed.  After this portion of his examination has been completed, Major Clarkson escorted Mr. Parry to the exposition grounds.  This was the traditional "last straw," and Mr. Parry was amazed beyond expression.  He looked the grounds and buildings over completely and when he returned to exposition headquarters he confessed to the greatest astonishment at the immense amount of work that had been accomplished for the money expended.</p>
                            <p>"The thing that is worrying me the most," said Mr. Parry, "is how I am going to convey an adequate impression of this thing to Governor Mount.  Words will not express the wonderful things you folks have accomplished.  It is far beyond the conception of anyone who has not seen it.  I cannot find language that will convey to another the grandeur and magnificence of the work you are doing.  I do not believe the governor will hesitate much longer when I tell him as best I can what has been done here.'</p>

                            <head type="sub">Special Act Will Not Be Passed by the Legislature.</head>
                            <p>A telegram from Senator Pusey yesterday announced that there was no possibility of securing the passage of the special bill allowing Iowa counties to make appropriations of $5,000 and less for exhibits at the Transmississippi Exposition, and one source of income that was looked forward to by the Council Bluffs Exposition committee with considerable confidence has been effectually closed.  The bill would have been pushed through the legislature long ago had it not been for the fear that its introduction would have interfered with the appropriation for the Iowa exhibit.  Both houses had been carefully canvassed and the fact ascertained that a large majority of the members would have voted for the measure.  It was also ascertained that a large number of counties throughout the state would have taken advantage of it and installed expensive and attractive exhibits.  The opponents of the exposition measure were aware of the situation and purposely delayed the general appropriation in the hope that the friends of the special bill would not be able to overcome their impatience and would introduce it.  There would have been no opposition to its passage, but it would have effectually killed the appropriation.  Senator Pusey was urged to make the effort to get it before the legislature, and when he returned to Des Moines on Tuesday he promised to take it up at once and if there was any chance for its enactment to push it through.  His telegram yesterday simply stated that owing to the fact that the legislature was on the eve of adjournment and the great mass of unfinished business on hand it would be impossible to secure any consideration for a new measure.</p>
                            <p>The result is disappointing to the local association, but not at all discouraging.  Enough money is in sight to build the wigwam.  The appropriation that was practically assured from the county would have been of material assistance in the work.  The changed situation will not call for any material modification of the original plans for raising the money necessary to pay for the big building.  Three floors will be placed in the structure, and the space leased to exhibitors.  Enough applications have been received to make a fund that will go a long way toward defraying the cost of the building.  One new proposition comes from a maker of pumps and windmills, who offers to furnish the power necessary to operate the hydraulic elevator that a local firm has <choice><sic>offere</sic><corr>offered</corr></choice> to install.  The proposition will probably be considered at the meeting of the association at the Grand hotel this evening.</p>

                            <p>The exposition management is now beginning to see the end of the list of buildings which must be erected in order to complete the preparations for the greatest American exposition ever held, and within a short time building operations on the part of the exposition will have been completed.</p>
                            <p>Little remains to be done in the main court except to construct the fountains, complete the colonnades and install the vases, statuary and other decorations which will contribute to the general beauty of the scene.</p>
                            <p>There will be a number of fountains, the largest one being in the Mirror.  Two of large size will be at either side of Twentieth street just inside the main entrance to the main court, and others in the small parks at the eastern part of the main court.  The only buildings in the main court yet to be constructed are the International building and the Girls' and Boys' building.  Both are under contract and will be ready for occupancy before May 1, the contractors being required to complete the work before that time.</p>
                            <p>No additional buildings are to be constructed by the exposition on the bluff tract.  The Horticulture building and the two restaurants at the east end of the viaduct are well under way, and all the other buildings on this tract will be erected by state commissions or private parties.</p>
                            <p>On the north tract the Transportation and Agricultural Implement building is making very rapid progress.  The lumber for the immense structure is all on the ground and a large force of men is at work making the chips fly.  The Dairy and Apiary buildings are also under way and the freight warehouse will be commenced in a few days.  These complete the list on the north tract, with the exception of the stock sheds.  The latter will not required until early in the fall and will probably not be erected until that time.</p>
                            <p>On the narrow neck of land connecting the main court and the north tract will be erected the Service building and the Fire and Police building.  The latter is being advertised for bids and the former will be ready for advertisement within a few days.  The Service building will furnish a place for the office force of the exposition, and one end of the lower floor will be arranged as a hospital with all the modern improvements for caring for the sick.</p>
                            <p>If the Indian bill is passed by congress, and there is every assurance that it will become a law in the near future, some kind of a large building will be required for the gatherings which will be occasioned by the Indian performances.  No plans have been made for this, but the matter has been considered and no time will be lost when the necessity arises for such a building.</p>
                            <p>Bids for the construction of the Girls' and Boys' building were opened at the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds as follows:  Carpentry&#8212;A. G. Wahlstrom, $6,896;  Westlake Construction company, $7,180; Thomas Herd, $7,400; George Moore &amp; Sons, $7,477; William Goldie &amp; Sons company, $7,740.  Staff work&#8212;Alexander &amp; Son, $2,750; Smith &amp; Eastman, $1,975; F. A. Sieffert, $2,344.  The lowest bids on these two branches of work make a total cost for the building of $8,471.  These bids were laid before the executive committee by Manager Kirkendall yesterday afternoon and contracts ordered drawn with Wahlstrom and Smith &amp; Eastman.</p>

The first meeting of the commission will be held in Topeka tomorrow and it is the general understanding that the members will come to Omaha in a body within a few days, for the purpose of seeing just what has been done to make definite arrangements for space for the Kansas exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lamb joined his colleague, Mr. Greef of Pittsburg, as soon as he arrived, and together they visited the exposition headquarters and held a conference with the officials of the Exhibits department.  Desirable space was shown them in the main buildings and it was agreed that about 3,000 feet should be held for Kansas until the commission organizes and decides just what shall be done.  After examining the plats Messrs. Greef and Lamb selected the following spaces in the buildings named: Mines, 960 feet; Agriculture, 720; Liberal Arts, 640; Horticulture, 378.  The space in the Liberal Arts building will be occupied by an educational exhibit.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the space in the main buildings the two commissioners visited the grounds in company with Major Clarkson and selected a site on the bluff tract for the Kansas building, securing a most desirable location.</p>
                            <p>All of the action of the commissioners relating to the full commission when it meets tomorrow in Topeka for ratification, but Messrs.

                            <p>"It is now so near the opening of the exposition," said Mr. Lamb, "that we will be unable to make as fine a showing in agricultural and horticultural products as we would like to make, but we will be able to do better as soon as we can utilize our new crops.  We have some material on hand in the way of grasses and grains and these will be utilized to the best advantage, but in vegetables and fruits we will be compelled to wait until the new crop is ready for use.  My community is in the wheat belt, and out showing will be in the agricultural and horticultural lines; when we are prepared to make a showing in those lines it will be a fine one."</p>
                            <p>After visiting the grounds Mr. Lamb was in the same state of mind as every other visitors who comes from abroad his astonishment knew no bounds.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Greef and Lamb returned home this evening.</p>

                            <p>The Midway is the busiest place on the grounds and as the time for opening approaches the activity on this section of the grounds increases.  A large number of the concessionaires are now on the ground overseeing the construction of their buildings and more are coming every day.  By the latter part of next week every concession on the street will be under construction.</p>
                            <p>The Moorish village is growing rapidly.  The handsome palace is nearing completion and a number of minor buildings have been started.  The lumber for the Streets of Cairo is on the ground and works will be started at once.  "Shooting the Chutes" is under construction, and the same is true of the Pabst pavilion, the Wild West show, Haegenbeck's Animal show, the Big Rock, the Cyclorama, Cosmopolis and the Concessionaires' club.</p>
                            <p>Several other concessionaires are on the ground and will commence work early next week.  Among these are the Scenic railway, the Giant Seesaw, the Birth of Our Nation, the Chinese village and the German village.</p>
                            <p>So great has been the demand for space on the Midway that it has been necessary to extend that portion of the exposition south on Twentieth street toward the main court and attractions are being located all along the east side of the street as far south as International building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Campbell of the Nebraska Commission in a Quandary.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Campbell of the Nebraska Exposition commission is in a quandary regarding certain instructions given by the commission at its last meeting.  The commission found that it had room in various nooks and corners of the rotunda of the Nebraska building for twenty desks, and it was decided to allow twenty of the secret fraternal benefit societies of the state to use these locations for headquarters, each society to furnish a desk and such other furnishings as they desired.  The secretary was instructed to notify each of these societies of this action and inform them that space would be assigned to those applying as long as the space lasted.  This instruction is the cause of the secretary's uneasiness.  He has sent notices to all of the societies he could think of or learn about, but is afraid some of them may have been overlooked and feel slighted at not receiving a personal notice that the space may be had for the asking.  He has received ten applications, leaving ten spaces which have not been assigned or applied for.  He wishes all fraternal benefit societies to understand that they are welcome to room in the building for a desk to use as headquarters, but application must be made to him in person or by mail.  The available space will be assigned as fast as applications are received and an influx of applications is looked for.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Detailed Statement Showing the Advantage of the Plan from an Advertising Standpoint and the Expense of Printing and Mailing.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Directors of the exposition was held yesterday afternoon.  The session was rather short and a small amount of business was transacted.  The most important matter considered was the advisability of borrowing money to tide the exposition over the rough places before the opening of the gates and the executive committee was authorized to negotiate a loan if is becomes necessary.</p>
                            <p>The first business presented to the meeting was the Sunday closing question.  It came up in the form of a protest of the Omaha Ministerial union against opening the gates of the exposition on Sunday.  Along with this came the vigorous protests of the labor unions of the city against closing the gates on the only day in the week the working men and their families would have an opportunity of visiting the show.  There was very little discussion of the matter, the consensus of opinion being that the time had not arrived to take this subject up for serious consideration, and all the papers relating to it were laid over.</p>
                            <p>Another matter which has caused the good people of this vicinity considerable food for discussion was brought up and disposed of by the adoption of the following resolution introduced by General Manderson.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the directors that the same policy be pursued by the management that was pursued at Chicago, Philadelphia and other expositions and that is, that the selling of beer and various light drinks be allowed, but that bars and the sale of whisky, liquors, etc., on the grounds be prohibited.</p>
                            <p>When the reports of departments were called for Manager Rosewater presented a written report of the Department of Publicity and Promotion and spoke briefly of the work which has been done during the last month by that department.  He then asked the indulgence of the directors while he spoke of certain reports which have been industriously circulated regarding the alleged breach of trust perpetrated by the executive committee in voting $3,200 into the treasury of The Bee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater read extracts from an editorial in the World-Herald in which charges were made that $3,200 had been voted by the executive committee to Mr. Rosewater as a gift, and said that the executive committee had been accused of committing a breach of trust in voting the funds of the exposition into the pockets of a member of the committee.  He said he wished to explain certain things in connection with this matter in order that the executive committee might not be placed in a false light.  Railway passenger men who recently met in Omaha to make rates for the exposition had said that fully 80 per cent of the people who will visit the exposition will come from a territory within a radius of about 250 miles from Omaha and the question which the executive committee had been considering was how to best reach all the people within this radius.  It was the opinion of the committee that exposition literature should be placed in the homes of these people and the most important point to be decided was how this could best be accomplished.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">EXPLAINS THAT SUPPLEMENT.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said he regretted that Mr. Hitchcock was not present, as he wished to give him an opportunity to call in question the accuracy of the figures he should quote.  He then stated that the Department of Publicity and Promotion had had little difficulty in reaching the people in the towns and cities all over the country, but difficulty had been encountered in reaching the farmers and people living in rural districts.  Packages of pamphlets could be sent cheaply to the cities and towns and distributed without expense by railroad agents, but the rural districts could only be reached by mail and the element of cost was an important one.  After full consideration of the matter, he said, he had recommended, and the executive committee had authorized, the issuance of 200,000 copies of a four-page exposition supplement of The Weekly Bee at a cost of $3,200.  Mr. Rosewater then proceeded to draw a comparison as between the cost of printing and mailing 200,000 illustrated newspapers.  The amount of matter in the four-page supplement of The Weekly Bee would be equal, he said, to the matter contained in the thirty-two-page pamphlets which have been issued by the department.  In lots of 100,000 these pamphlets have cost from $745 to $750, making the cost of 200,000 copies $1,500.  The agreement with The Bee Publishing company provides that the 200,000 copies of the regular issue of The Weekly Bee and the proposed illustrative supplement shall be mailed to farmers residing within a radius of 250 miles from Omaha.  In order to send the same number of pamphlets through the mail would require the procuring of a list of 200,000 names, the cost of which would be at least $200, and the envelopes and work of addressing the pamphlets would cost at least $500 more, while the postage on the pamphlets at 1 cent each would amount to $2,000, making a total cost of $4,200, or just $1,000 more than was to be paid for the 200,000 copies of The Bee.  As to the reasonableness of the charge made by The Bee Mr. Rosewater quoted still other figures.  He said it would be necessary to have the work of the illustrated supplement done in a job office, because such fine work cannot be done by newspaper presses.  For this work he presented competitive bids from the local job offices.  He quoted these bids, the figures running from $1,452 to $2,018.  The paper proposed to be used he said would be of an extra quality, costing from 5 to 6 cents per pound.  The weight of the supplement would be eleven tons, and 200,000 copies of the regular edition would weigh 25,000 pounds, the postage on which would be $470.  The cost of the list of names of farmers, the addressing of the wrappers and the work of mailing, etc., would bring the total cost up to $3,122.  Mr. Rosewater produced a schedule of the figures he had quoted, which he said he would leave with the secretary to be examined by any person who cared to do so.  This statement was as follows:</p>

                            <p>In closing his statement Mr. Rosewater called attention to the further fact that no money is to pass between the exposition and The Bee for this work, but the full amount of $3,200 is to be credited on his subscription of $5,000 to the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Manager Lindsey followed Mr. Rosewater with a report of the Ways and Means department.  He said the recent work of the department had been announced through the newspapers and he had little to add.  Regarding the instruction given him at the last meeting regarding bringing suits against delinquent subscribers of $500 or more, Mr. Lindsey said he had been out of the city so much that he had not had time to take action and he asked further time, saying that he would take action by May 1.  He also requested authority to commence suits against delinquent subscribers of $50 or over.  This was granted and he announced that these suits will be started by May 1.</p>
                            <p>In addition to this Mr. Lindsey, at the request of the executive committee, asked authority for the negotiation of a loan in case it becomes necessary to do so.  After a short discussion this was agreed to and the committee was authorized to use its direction in the matter.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed reported that the Concessions department had made sale of concessions amounting to $47,000, on which payments of $35,000 had been made in cash.  The balance is due before June 1.  He estimates the total receipts of his department up to June 1 at $70,000, being about $20,000 higher than any previous estimates.</p>
                            <p>On motion of Mr. Rosewater the board adjourned until 4 p. m. Tuesday next.</p>

                            <p>A committee headed by President Graham of the Council Bluffs Exposition association held a conference with the members of the Board of Supervisors yesterday afternoon and made a statement of the condition of the building fund designed for the erection of the Pottawattamie wigwam on the exposition grounds.  This statement was of such a character that it indicated the necessity for financial assistance from the county.  The matter had been thoroughly canvassed several weeks ago and the fact made prominent that there was a strong feeling on the part of a majority of the citizens of the county favorable to the board making a suitable appropriation for the purpose of a creditable exhibit of the county's products and resources at the exposition.  The supervisors yesterday listened <choice><sic>kndly</sic><corr>kindly</corr></choice> to the suggestions made by Chairman Graham and no objections or criticisms were offered.  The matter was not presented to the board in such a manner that it would call for any sort of commitment of the members, but merely the necessity for some action was urged.  Every member showed the liveliest interest in the subject, and when the suggestion was made that the board adjourn and accompany the committee across the river for the purpose of viewing the exposition buildings the invitation was promptly accepted and a resolution was passed adjourning the board for the afternoon.</p>
                            <p>At 2 o'clock the members and the committee took a motor car for Omaha.  Nearly <choice><sic>al</sic><corr>all</corr></choice> the afternoon was spent in viewing the sights around the exposition grounds and the board members returned in the evening more favorably impressed than ever with the importance of taking prompt action to assist the wigwam enterprise.</p>
                            <p>So far no particular amount to be appropriated has been suggested, but it has been ascertained that the individual members have fixed amounts in their minds varying from $1,000 to $2,000.  Either sum would be greatly appreciated by the exposition committee, but the latter amount would be received with devout thanks.  The board will take up the matter when it meets again this morning.  One or the other of these amounts will be appropriated unless the board is shown that there is positively no warrant in law for it.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the National Association of Firemen is in the city for the purpose of consulting with the exposition management regarding the inducements which will be offered for the holding in Omaha during the exposition of a national firemen's tournament.  Those constituting the delegation are Fred A. Wood of Cedar Falls, Ia., president of the National association and of the Illinois association; H. S. Salisbury of Whitewater, Wis., treasurer of the National association; C. Hill Porter of Carthage, Mo., secretary and treasurer of the Southwestern Firemen's association; T. Hargiss of Weir City, Kan., director in the Southwestern Firemen's association and chief of the Weir City fire department, and I. E. Alderman of Marion, Ia.</p>
                            <p>This committee was taken in charge by Major Clarkson of the exposition executive department and escorted to the exposition grounds.  Before going to the grounds the committee assembled in the office of Chief Redell in the city hall.  In reply to questions members of the committee stated that before leaving Omaha a meeting will be held to decide whether the tournament shall be held in Omaha or be located at some of the other points which are making overtures for the meet.  They said that Detroit is making strong efforts to have the tournament held in that city, but the members of the committee agree that the prospects for a large attendance at the tournament would be much better in Omaha than in Detroit, on account of the large number of people who will be in the city attending the exposition.  They stated that they expect an attendance of at least 50,000 firemen aside from the large number of people who will be drawn to the city by the tournament.  They expect to hang up large purses as prizes in the different classes and the size of the purses will be very largely regulated by the prospective gate receipts.</p>
                            <p>The committee will meet with President Wattles and Chief Redell, in whose hands the details of arrangements have been put and will then hold a meeting to decide whether the tournament shall be held in Omaha.</p>

                            <p>The Iowa Exposition commission met in Des Moines on Tuesday of this week and decided to confine the expenditures for an exhibit to a few departments.  Every effort will be made to make a fine showing in agriculture, horticulture and dairy, and it is probable that provision may be made for a live stock exhibit when the proper time comes.  All the details of the work will be under the general direction of Secretary Chase, who has had wide experience in exposition matters.  He will open an office in Council Bluffs within a short time and will give his entire time to the work.</p>
                            <p>It was announced at the meeting of the commission that Iowa has been allotted space in the center of the Agriculture and Horticulture buildings, the most conspicuous and desirable space in the building.</p>
                            <p>The Iowa building will be constructed in accordance with the plans of Josslyn &amp; Taylor of Cedar Rapids and will cost about $8,000.  The contract for this building will be let within two weeks and work will be commenced at once.  It is stated that a feature of the building will be the exhibition of paintings of Iowa artists.  A skylight will be placed in the building and Iowa artists will be invited to send their paintings for exhibition.</p>

                            <p>The business men of Houston, Tex, have offered a prize of $100 for the design that will best represent Houston at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Applications have been received from the Remington Arms company for an exhibit of firearms, and from the Shaw Piano company of Cleveland, O., for an exhibit of pianos.</p>
                            <p>Members of the Victoria Diamond Jubilee association and all persons of Canadian birth are requested to meet at the directors' room, sixth floor Paxton block, on Monday night, 8 p. m., for the purpose of perfecting an organization to help entertain British visitors to the exposition this summer.</p>
                            <p>Governor Mount of Indiana writes to the Department of Publicity and Promotion that he is endeavoring to secure members of an Indiana Exposition commission, but is meeting with some difficulty in getting people to serve without remuneration.  He says, however, that he expects to complete the commission within a short time.</p>
                            <p>Dr. E. E. Chivers, editor of the Baptist Union of Chicago, visited the exposition grounds this morning.  He was highly pleased.  The doctor, who had visited Nashville, said the Transmississippi Exposition far surpasses it, presenting artistic effects quite as impressive as the Columbian Fair architecture.</p>
                            <p>J. J. Leeson, the commissioner of New Mexico, who will have charge of the exhibit to be made by that territory, has notified the exposition management that he will be in Omaha about April 15 to <choice><sic>prefect</sic><corr>perfect</corr></choice> further details regarding his exhibit.  A similar notice has been received from Vice President Shurtliff of Utah, who telegraphed that he will be in Omaha Tuesday next, to make final arrangements for the Utah exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The general conference of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at Independence, Mo., considered an invitation extended to the church by the exposition management to be represented at the exposition.  A resolution that the last Sunday of this month be set aside for offerings from the members of the church for the maintenance of an exhibit at Omaha was defeated, and the matter was referred to the president and bishops of the church, who will report their views on the subject to the church.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Six Women Are Named and the Number Will Be Increased to Ten When the Occasion Demands Such Action.</head>
                            <p>The first meeting of the Bureau of Entertainment was held yesterday afternoon in the directors' room at exposition headquarters.  The Bureau of Entertainment is to be charged with the duty of providing suitable social entertainment for the distinguished people who are expected to favor Omaha and the exposition with their presence.  The members of the bureau will be expected to entertain at their homes on state occasions and assist in making the visit of prominent people to Omaha a memorable event.</p>
                            <p>Those constituting the Bureau of Entertainment at present are:  Mesdames C. F. Manderson, C. W. Lyman, H. T. Clarke, G. M. Hitchcock, John L. Webster and F. P. Kirkendall.  These women assembled in the directors' room, where they were addressed by President Wattles, who explained what the bureau would be expected to do and outlined the plan of organization which he believed best suited to the occasion.  The women present were formally appointed by the president as the executive committee of the bureau and were given authority to increase their number to ten.  When this number shall have been reached the ten women will organize by electing such officers as they consider necessary, after which they will still further increase their number to fifty, this number to constitute the full bureau.</p>
                            <p>The matter was talked over informally by the women without any definite action being taken and they adjourned until Tuesday, when a second meeting will be held.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Members of the National Association in Omaha to Talk Business.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the National Association of Firemen is in the city for the purpose of consulting with the exposition management regarding the inducements which will be offered for the holding in Omaha during the exposition of a national firemen's tournament.  Those constituting the delegation are Fred A. Wood of Cedar Falls, Ia., president of the National association and of the Iowa association; C. Hill Porter of Carthage, Mo., secretary and treasurer of the Southwestern Firemen's association and chief of the Weir City fire department, and I. E. Alderman of Marion, Ia.</p>
                            <p>This committee was taken in charge by Major Clarkson of the exposition executive department and escorted to the exposition grounds.  Before going to the grounds the committee assembled in the office of Chief Redell in the city hall.  In reply to questions members of the committee stated that before leaving Omaha a meeting will be held to decide whether the tournament shall be held in Omaha or be located at some of the other points which are making overtures for the meet.  They said that Detroit is making strong efforts to have the tournament held in that city, but the members of the committee agree that the prospects for a large attendance at the tournament would be much better in Omaha than in Detroit, on account of the large number of people who will be in the city attending the exposition.
                            
                            <pb n="77" xml:id="TMISB04-077"/>
                            
                            They stated that they expect all attendance of at least 50,000 firemen aside from the large number of people who will be drawn to the city by the tournament.  They expect to hang up large purses as prizes in the different classes and the size of the purses will be very largely regulated by the prospective gate receipts.</p>
                            <p>The committee will meet with President Wattles and Chief Redell, in whose hands the details of arrangements have been put, and will then hold a meeting to decide whether the tournament shall be held in Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Will Deliver an Address at Opening of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles returned home yesterday from a brief rest at Hot Springs, Ark., and found among the letters on his desk one from Senator Allen, accepting the invitation to deliver an address on the opening day of the exposition, provided matters were in such shape at that time as would permit him absenting himself from attendance upon the sessions of congress.</p>
                            <p>A letter from Secretary L. S. Scott of the Western Editorial association stated that the <choice><sic>associatiton</sic><corr>association</corr></choice> will meet in Omaha July 7 to 9 and asked that those dates be designated as "Louisiana days," in honor of the association.  The president notified the secretary that the request would be complied with.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has sent out letters to the governors and exposition vice presidents of each of the transmississippi states, asking them to select days during the exposition to be designated in honor of each of these states.  Similar letters will be sent to the governors of each of the eastern states, making a like request.</p>
                            <p>The president is in receipt of replies to letters sent to the adjutant general of each state west of Ohio, inviting the militia of each state to camp at Omaha during the summer.  These replies are nearly all favorable but a proviso is inserted that in the event of disturbance incident to the Cuban trouble the militia will probably be otherwise engaged.</p>
                            <p>The Kansas Editorial association has asked the exposition management to designate some day in July on which the members of that association may run an excursion from all points in their territory and visit the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Philip Andres of the Transmississippi Turnfest asked that provision be made for admitting to the drill grounds in the exposition grounds the classes and drill teams of the various Turner societies which will participate in the fest.  It is proposed to hold these drills the afternoon of June 30, the opening day of the turnfest.</p>

                            <p>A well attended meeting of natives of Ohio was held at the Commercial club rooms at noon yesterday for the purpose of taking steps to provide for the entertainment of visitors from that state who may attend the exposition.  Luncheon was served and then the business of the meeting was taken up.  It was decided to reorganize the old club which flourished a few years ago and the rules of that club were followed for the time being.</p>
                            <p>The election of officers resulted as follows: John L. Webster, president; J. C. Denise, first vice president; N. M. Howard, second vice president; N. A.

The election of a board of trustees was deferred until the next meeting.</p>
                            <p>Jonathan Edwards, C. D. Thompson and Harrison were appointed a committee to draft a constitution and by-laws for the government of the club to be presented at the next meeting.  They were instructed to place the membership fee at $1.</p>
                            <p>H. L. Day, G. W. Wright and N. M. Howard were appointed a committee to secure permanent headquarters for the club.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles has been overwhelmed with poems of all sizes and shapes, dedicated to the exposition and designed to be read as a part of the opening exercises of the great show.  These have all been carefully filed away and the president puts in his leisure time perusing them and passing upon their literary merits.  The latest addition to this collection was on the president's desk when he returned from a brief vacation.  It was very handsomely gotten up, being neatly printed on silk bolting cloth with a typewriter.  At one side of the writing was a tuft of golden rod, done in oil, and at the other side was a cluster of oats and a stock of corn.  The whole was made in the form of a banneret, with a chain and rod to suspend it.  The work was the production of Harriet W. Leighton of Lincoln, Neb.</p>

                            <p>The outlook for a New York building on the bluff tract is becoming very bright.  The New York commission has an appropriation of $7,500 and a balance of $5,000 from the Nashville appropriation.  The commission asked Dunnavant &amp; Thompson of this city to submit a sketch of a building and this has been furnished.  This firm built the New York building at the Nashville exposition.</p>

                            <p>The Logan (Ia.)

                            <head type="sub">Every Division of the Department Has Its Own Particular Plan Worked Out and the Whole is Arranged.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 9.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;While all Washington is actively interested in the preparations going on for the defence of the United States in its war with Spain, should such a thing come about, the various departments included in the government exhibit are earnestly preparing for the coming Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha.  Considerable has been written about the exhibit which the Treasury department will make and also that of the Interior department, but little or nothing has yet been printed about the scope and effect of the Agricultural department show.  Assistant Secretary Brigham, chairman of the government board, called upon the various chiefs of bureaus of his department last week with the request that they outline the subject matter of the exhibit which they will make under the head of agriculture.  As a result a very interesting series of papers have been filed with the assistant secretary, descriptive of the particular exhibits which are now being prepared for transportation to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The Agricultural department exhibit will be located in the southwest corner of the government building in a space somewhat larger than that occupied at the Nashville exposition.  The alcove system of installation will be followed as far as possible, which will give two lines of exhibits; those fronting on the main aisle and those displayed on the rear aisle and abutting upon the walls of the building.  The two exhibits on either end of the space, namely, the exhibits of the Weather bureau and the Bureau of Animal Industry, will have a frontage of twenty feet each, running back forty-two feet to the wall.  The other main aisle of the exhibits are those of the divisions of chemistry, entomology and pomology.  Back of these across the center aisle, running through the space north and south and occupying alcoves, will be installed the exhibits of the divisions of botany, forestry, vegetable physiology and the office of fiber investigations.  The plan of installation will be similar to that at Nashville and the same colors will be used in the furniture and cases and in the fabric backgrounds.  All woodwork will be painted in drop black with an "egg shell polish" and an old-gold scheme of color will be used in the paint and fabrics of interiors.  Colonel Brigham is assisted in the details of preparation and installations by Mr. Charles Richards Dodge.  The exhibit material of the Agricultural department will be shipped about the middle of this month.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DETAILS OF THE EXHIBIT.</head>
                            <p>The exhibit of fiber investigations will illustrate the flax and hemp industries of the world as far as it has been possible to secure the commercial varieties of the different countries.  The specimens will be arranged in panels under plate glass and will be displayed around three sides of an alcove, making a display of forty-four feet in extent and about seven feet high.</p>
                            <p>One of the most interesting exhibits will be that of the Bureau of Animal Industry.  Dr. Salmon, chief of the bureau, is particularly anxious that the object lesson contained in his department will afford ample opportunity for the thousands who will visit the exposition to learn something about this ever widening branch of the government.  A practical demonstration of the inspection of pork, as conducted by the bureau at various packing centers of the United States, will be one of the chief features of the exhibit.  Several assistant microscopists will be transferred from the South Omaha bureau to the exposition, where they will be engaged in the examination of pork samples furnished them daily from the South Omaha packing houses.  There will be models of vats used in the dipping of sheep for scab.  This will include a circular yard and vat attached as used in Australia for dipping sheep.  Near this will be a model of the sheep vat in use at the Union stock yard, Chicago, for the same purpose.</p>
                            <p>In the dairy division there will be shown the composition of milk and its products, comprising eight series.  A cheese weighing ten pounds and with it a series of glass jars, showing water, fat, curd, sugar and mineral matter, which are its component parts.  There will also be exhibits of fowls affected with gape worm disease, samples of wool from various states and various breeds of sheep, a case containing models of horses' feet with various systems of shoeing, and pathological specimens in alcohol of diseased organs, being a portion of those collected by the scientific investigators of the bureau and illustrating the lesions found in animals affected with various diseases.</p>

                            <p>The display to be made by the division of agrostology will be of a character similar to that at Nashville and will consist of a number of pen drawings of grasses and a display of sheaves of grasses principally from the prairie and Rocky mountain regions.</p>

                            <p>Prof. Willis L. Moore, chief of the Weather bureau, is especially anxious that his department give a good account of itself and has arranged for a display of the various instruments and apparatus used in making <choice><sic>meterological</sic><corr>meteorological</corr></choice> observations, including types of the latest devices for reading and recording the elements, such as wind velocity, wind direction, temperature, rainfall, etc.  He will place in position a complete printing and <choice><sic>sterotyping</sic><corr>stereotyping</corr></choice> outfit, by means of which a weather may will be prepared daily by the officials in charge of expert officials, and every effort will be made to fully and personally explain to all interested visitors the various instruments and their uses.</p>
                            <p>The government forestry exhibit planned for the Omaha Exposition will consist of two principal features in indoor and outdoor exhibits.  The outdoor exhibit will show operations in forestry planting as actually practiced at agricultural stations in various western and other states.  The indoor exhibit will consist of three features, monographs of important timber species for the west, a forest botanical display of about 200 or more transmississippi and other tree species, arranged in glass cases so as to reflect the wood, foliage, flowers and fruit, together with the geographical range, etc., and a series of relief models of farms showing the intimate relation of proper farm forest management in maintaining the highest efficiency of arable land.</p>
                            <p>Much is expected from the division of entomology and Prof. L. O. Howard, chief entomologist, in a letter to Assistant Secretary Brigham, states that his division will comprise a series of cases illustrating this growing industry.  Especial exhibits will be made of insects which damage farm animals, fruits and fruit trees, corn and the small grains, forage crops and garden vegetables.</p>

                            <p>The division of pomology will be represented by models, paintings, drawings and descriptions of such variety of fruits as are mainly adapted to the western and northwestern portion of the United State.  There will be a miscellaneous collection of models which will partially represent the semi-tropical fruits of this country.  In addition the division will endeavor to make theirs an educational exhibit by showing various samples of fruits in different grades and also the fruit in original packages as they are put on the market by the packers.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit of the division of botany will be devoted chiefly to pure seeds and poisonous plants, together with seed cleaning machinery and apparatus used for testing the purity and germinating capacity of seeds.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the lack of funds the division of vegetable physiology and pathology will prepare no special exhibit illustrating its work.  An exhibit will be prepared under its direction, however, illustrating the cultivation of mushrooms.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit of the division of chemistry at the Omaha Exposition will relate solely to the beet sugar industry.  On large screens will be shown enlarged photographs illustrating the buildings and portions of machinery and the beet yards of factories now in operation.  Many of the pictures show trains of cars arriving with the raw materials, sheds stored with thousands of dollars worth of the sugar beet and great quantities of supplies, indicative of large disbursements to farmers, farm laborers, quarrymen, miners, etc.  There will also be displayed a historical collection of American beet sugar from its first manufacture.  Statistical charts, models of typical beets and samples of beets from various parts of the country will conclude an exhibit that cannot help but be one of the drawing cards at Omaha this year.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Local Chorus is Gaining in Numbers and Quality.</head>
                            <p>The Musical department of the exposition is now getting well under way, and the local chorus is gaining in numbers and in quality.</p>
                            <p>Arrangements are now in progress with regard to the procuring of copies of "Fair Ellen," by Max Bruch, a work for soprano and baritone solos, chorus and orchestra.  The chorus work of this selection is especially strong.  It is founded on the story of the relief of Lucknow, and the leading theme is the old Scotch melody, "The Campbells Are Coming."</p>
                            <p>Nothing has yet developed in regard to the chorus book, and if it cannot be had at once, it will be abandoned and another arrangement made for the securing of these choruses.  The time is very short for rehearsals and the chorus is well able to do a large amount of work in a short time, so that a varied and extensive repertoire may be looked for.</p>
                            <p>Director Kimball is anxiously waiting for reports from some of the choral societies with which he has been corresponding.  It is thought that a complete list of attractions will soon be given to the public.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SAVED MANY SETTLERS FROM STARVING</head>
                            <head type="sub">Curious Relic of the Early History of Nebraska Offered for Exhibit at the Coming Exposition.</head>
                            <p>A curious old relic of pioneer days in Nebraska has been put at the disposition of the exposition management by S. B. Parks of Scribner, one of the earliest settlers in Nebraska.  It is a corn and cub crusher, which did noble service during the severe winters which marked the early history of the struggling territory.  Mr. Parks wrote to Secretary R. W. Furnas of the Nebraska Historical society and offered to allow the old mill to be exhibited among the precious relics which the society has gathered from all quarters.  He asked that transportation be furnished for the old mill, which is still intact.  Secretary Furnas forwarded the letter to Secretary Wakefield and the latter has turned it over to Secretary O. C. Holmes of the Nebraska Millers' association, with the suggestion that the mill be installed as a part of the exhibit of milling machinery and products to be made under the auspices of the association.  Secretary Holmes will lay the matter before the executive committee of his association at an early day and it is highly probable that the historic old relic will be given a prominent place in the exhibit of modern milling machinery.</p>
                            <p>The letter of Mr. Parks to Secretary Furnas contains a pathetic story in a few words.  Aside from questions regarding shipment the body of the letter was as follows:</p>
                            <p>I have a cast iron corn and cob crusher which I think is the first grist mill in Nebraska territory.  It was brought from Quincy, Ill., to Fontanelle, Neb., in 1855 by a Mr. Richardson.  I bought it of his widow in 1860.  It furnished the meal and "samp" that kept the people of Fontanelle from starving the terrible winter of 1856-7.  It also furnished the principal food for all the pioneer settlers of Fremont, West Point, DeWitt and vicinity and Elkhorn valley as far as settled.  It did good service in the winter of 1861-2.  There was about two feet of snow on the level that winter and we had to grind corn and wheat in the old mill or starve.  The grinding process was very simple&#8212;hitch a yoke of cattle on the end of the sweep, put your corn or wheat in the hopper and pound your oxen on the back.  With a sieve you sifted the ground material.  The course product was ground again.  You could grind about ten bushels a day if you attended to business.  Yet I must give the old mill credit for being industrious, for just as soon as it finished grinding one grain it commenced on another.  Yet it was a great improvement on a coffee mill that we ground sod corn in in the winter of 1858.  The hopper and sweep of the old mill are gone and the stump on which it rests is about two and one-half inches in diameter.</p>

                            <head type="sub">OUTLINE FOR MINING EXHIBIT.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Dr. Day Gives an Idea of How He Hopes to Arrange the Building.</head>
                            <p>Dr. David T. Day, the mining commissioner of the exposition, has started on a tour of the western mining states for the purpose of seeing to it that the magnificent mineral resources of the great west are fittingly represented in the Transmississippi Exposition.  Dr. Day is chief of the Mining bureau of the United States Geological survey and has direct charge of the compilation of the mineral statistics which form such an important factor in the business of <choice><sic>thise</sic><corr>those</corr></choice> who have mining interests.  His position in the government service not only gives him a knowledge of the resources of a given section and of where the best varieties of each mineral are to be found, but it also gives him an influence with the mine owners which makes them very <choice><sic>desirious</sic><corr>desirous</corr></choice> of complying with any reasonable request he may make.  It is, therefore, practically assured that his visit among the mines of the mineral producing west will result in a mining exhibit which will surpass anything in that line ever attempted in any section of the country.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Day's idea of a mining exhibit is not to have the huge Mining building filled with minerals of various kinds, dumped in heaps with a view of realizing as much advertising benefit to the owner as possible, but he proposes, and says he will have, an exhibit in which the classification will be such that the exhibit will be an education in geology and the applied sciences.  The various exhibits will be arranged in such a way that the raw material and the location in which it is found will be shown, followed by the numerous processes, in order, through which the raw material passes in order to produce the finished product.</p>
                            <p>With this idea in view the commissioner will visit the several mining districts to inspect the material that is being collected for shipment to Omaha.  This inspection will probably result, in many cases, in a request for the elimination of some material deemed undesirable and the substitution of other material to make the exhibit more complete.</p>
                            <p>One governing desire on the part of Dr. Day is to make the exhibit of gems a prominent feature of the mineral exhibit.  For this purpose he will endeavor to have displayed a fine collection of the beautiful turquoise found in New Mexico.  A section will be devoted to the Idaho opals, which equal in beauty and value those of Hungary and Queensland.  The beautiful blue sapphires which have lately been found in Montana will be added to the fine collection of lighter shades which is available for exhibition.  Diamonds found in Wisconsin and the <choice><sic>ebautiful</sic><corr>beautiful</corr></choice> topaz found in Utah and Colorado, some of it of a beautiful pink shade, will add variety to the beautiful tints of the gem section.  A number of the magnificent quartz crystals recently found in California will probably appear in the collection and there will be garnets from New Mexico and Alaska and a new semi-precious stone from Utah&#8212;variscite.</p>
                            <p>In the gold section there will be nuggets in profusion.  Alaska will be represented in a collection of huge lumps of the yellow metal and California and Colorado will be strongly in evidence in this section.  Silver will be there, also, and Dr. Day has a pet project which he hopes to realize before his return from this trip, that of having a tall shaft in the form of a Corinthian column in the center of the building made of pure silver.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Commission Issues a Public Declaration of Intention.</head>
                            <p>Exposition matters have reached a crisis in Missouri.  A meeting of the state commission was held in St. Louis Friday of last week at which the treasurer reported that $11,000 had been subscribed, although all of this had not been turned over to him.  After a protracted session the commission issued a general notice to the public that unless $7,500 additional is subscribed by the date of the next meeting, April 22, the idea of having a state exhibit will be abandoned.</p>
                            <p>During the meeting the situation was thoroughly canvassed, and the members of the commission expressed themselves very freely regarding the apathy of several sections of the state.  The "enterprising and rich town of St. Joseph," as one of the commissioners called it, was credited with exactly $7, and its generosity furnished a text for several "complimentary" remarks.</p>
                            <p>Each commissioner reported on the condition in his district, and it was the consensus of opinion that the state will be saved the humiliation of being counted among the absentees at the exposition, but it was agreed that whatever is done must be done quickly and public announcement was made that unless at least $7,500 additional is in hand by the next meeting every member of the commission will resign.</p>
                            <p>It developed at this meeting that there are a number of localities which have raised money for a local exhibit, and none of this money appears in the money collected by the commission.  Individuals all over the state are also making preparations for exhibiting and activity in stock circles is especially noticeable.  St. Louis firms have notified the commission that their exhibit of live stock will be four times as large as at the World's fair and the exhibit of horticulture will be one of the finest ever seen in the country.  From the reports of the heads of the various departments it was evident that the space reserved by the commission will be entirely too small.  Every department has asked for additional space.</p>
                            <p>Plans for the Missouri building have been drawn by L. C. Buckley &amp; Bro., of St. Louis.  It is to be 60x90, and is a very handsome looking structure.  It will cost about $10,000.</p>

                            <p>Natives of New England resident in Omaha have formed a New England association to provide for the entertainment of visiting New Englanders who may attend the exposition and to make arrangements for a "New England day."</p>
                            <p>A meeting was held in Major Clarkson's office at exposition headquarters and a temporary organization effected by the selection of A. P. Tukey of Maine as chairman and W. H. Alexander of Connecticut as secretary.  The purpose of the meeting was discussed at some length and met with hearty approval, a committee consisting of one member from each New England state being appointed to formulate plans of organization and submit a report at an adjourned meeting to be held in the office of the Board of Park Commissioners at the city hall Friday, April 22.  This committee consists of the following:  A. P. Tukey, Maine; Dr. F. Brown, Maine; Colonel C. S. Chase, New Hampshire; George W. Holbrook, Vermont; George P. Bemis, Massachusetts; F. H. Chatfield, Connecticut; W. O. Taylor, Rhode Island.</p>

                            England society, of which Senator Thurston was the last president, and the Congregational club, of which Mr. Tukey was the last president.  Efforts are to be made to induce all natives of the New England states now residing in Omaha to unite with the society in order to make its work more effective.  In this connection all persons eligible to membership in the society are invited to attend the meeting to be held in the city hall April 22 to perfect a permanent organization.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Change in Nature of the Wigwam Comes with County's Help.</head>
                            <p>A special meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Exposition association will be held in the Grand hotel this evening.  It is earnestly desired that every member of the committee of fifty be present.  One of the matters to be considered is the immediate preparation for beginning the work of constructing the big wigwam.  While this work is under the immediate direction of the wigwam and building committees there will be duties connected with its construction that will call for the best energies and hearty co-operation of every member of the committee.  Another matter to be considered is the arrangements for preparation of the exhibits.  The donation of $2,000 by the county board gives every citizen of the county a direct interest in the enterprise and robs it of any distinctive Council Bluffs character that many of the farmers and out of town fruit raisers have felt inclined to attach to it.  It is an enterprise in which the people of the entire county are interested, and the association desires to take some steps tonight that will enlist the people of the county generally in the magnificent exhibit in the strikingly original structure that will be one of the most characteristic features of the entire exposition.</p>
                            <p>Other matters will also be up for consideration, and it is probable that a number of communications will be presented to the association.  The necessity will also be urged for the prompt collection of the $3,000 on the subscription lists, so that the entire fund can be made immediately available.  The work of construction, it has been decided, shall be under the immediate supervision of President A. C. Graham, and the building committee with his approval, will also have the privilege of employing all of the workmen engaged in the construction of the building.</p>

                            <p>McClure's Magazine has notified the Department of Publicity and Promotion that its special artist will visit Omaha within a few days to prepare illustrations for an exposition article to be written by William Allen White.  Mr. Jaccaci, the art manager of the magazine, will also come to Omaha to supervise the work.</p>
                            <p>The model of the battleship Maine, which has attracted a great deal of attention lately, has been removed from its glass case in the corridor near the door of Secretary Long in the State, War and Navy department building at Washington and has been packed for shipment to Omaha, where it will form a part of the exhibit to be made by the Navy department.</p>
                            <p>The funds collected by the various Idaho counties for the state exposition commission have commenced coming into the hands of the commission, and C. W. Moore of Boise has been appointed treasurer of the body.  The Oregon Short Line has taken an active part in the matter of a state exhibit and is lending its assistance in every possible way.  The commission report a good outlook for a fine state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>A report from Massachusetts is to the effect that Governor Wolcott informed a committee representing the various trade and commercial organizations of the state that he believed the time too short for Massachusetts to erect a state building at the exposition, but he favored the idea of having the state formally represented at the opening by a commission, and he is believed to be in favor of an appropriation to defray the expenses of such a commission.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Transmississippi Exposition Buildings to Present a Beautiful and Varied Arrangement of Warm Tones and Rich Tints.</head>
                            <p>Visitors to the exposition grounds during the last few days whose eyes have been dazzled by the glare of the sunlight reflected from the white buildings, will be gratified to learn that preparations are now making for painting the buildings and modifying the garish tone by the use of a soft tint which will be more agreeable to the eye while adding greatly to the effectiveness of the architectural beauty of the scene.</p>
                            <p>The entire exterior of the building in the main court will be painted a rich cream or old ivory tint, and the architectural adornment will be accentuated by the use of colors.  Bids have been opened at the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds for coloring the buildings with this tint of old ivory, and the work of bringing out the ornaments by the use of color has been placed in the hands of Walker &amp; Kimball, the architects-in-chief.</p>
                            <p>The use of color as an adjunct to the architecture of the building will mark a departure from the methods which have obtained in previous expositions in this country.  By this means the exposition buildings will be given a festival appearance in keeping with the uses to which they are devoted, and the monotony which would otherwise prevail will be relieved by the moderate use of subdued tones.</p>
                            <p>The Agriculture building will be the most elaborately decorated of any in the main court, for the reason that its architecture depends upon the use of color.  The main window bays will be decorated with fruits and flowers on a warm background and the tympana, (the flat, plain surface above the windows) will be decorated with repeated yard fowls.  The <choice><sic>ntrances</sic><corr>entrances</corr></choice> will be decorated, warm, rich colors being freely used in the lofty arches of the main entrance, and the half lights in the loggias at either end of the building being relieved by the use of colors.  Gold bronze will be freely used to bring out the important points in the decoration.</p>
                            <p>The ornament of the other buildings will be mostly conventional.  The dome of the Mines building will show the panels in rich colors and the ribs gilded.  The Art building will be "done" in faded tones that will not detract from the architectural adornment.  The domed ceiling of the lower arch in the Administration building, and the loggias back of the columns in the <choice><sic>uppor</sic><corr>upper</corr></choice> portion of the building will be decorated in colors and gold.  The background of the rosettes in the main arches will be gilded and the colors in the half lights will be rich and strong.  On the Machinery and Electricity building color will be used as a background for the ornament and the latter will be "picked out" in bright colors.</p>
                            <p>The colonnades will be treated in tones harmonizing with the buildings adjacent to them and the domes of the <choice><sic>pavillions</sic><corr>pavilions</corr></choice> of the colonnades will be gilded.</p>
                            <p>Preparations are being made by Walker &amp; Kimball to commence work on the color decoration as soon as the buildings are ready for that portion of the work.</p>
                            <p>But one bid was received at the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds for the tinting of the exterior of the buildings in the main court.  This bid was submitted by Smith, Eastman &amp; Allen and aggregated $9,619 for the buildings now erected.  A bid was also submitted for painting the fence which surrounds the exposition grounds, John Woerheide offering to do the work for $1,700.</p>

                            <p>County Commissioner Hoctor and J. P. Findley, who have the concession for the Afro-American village at the exposition, have their plans complete and will begin work next Monday morning with a large force of men.  The village will be upon the East Midway and will be located directly opposite the Moorish village.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hoctor says:  "We will put on a show that will surprise the amusement-seeking people who come to the exposition and at the same time we will show the past and present conditions of the colored people.  We have plans for twenty-one building.  There will be the old plantation cabins, built of logs and chinked with mud.  These will represent the life of the negro in the south as it existed thirty-five years ago.  The cabins will be equipped and furnished with all the appliances as they were at that time.  Then there will be the cotton gin of the old times and the slave market, where daily sales will be held, colored men, women and children being placed upon the block and offered at auction to the highest bidders.  In addition to this we will have a number of neat cottages, enabling us to show the home life of the colored man of the present date.</p>
                            <p>"We do not propose to have northern colored people, but instead we will have the genuine articles from the plantations of the south.  We have arranged to have 150 colored people in the village, where they will render the southern songs and all of the plantation dances.  There will be cotton and tobacco fields, all of which will be worked by colored people."</p>
                            <p>The Afro-American village will cover a tract of ground 170x170 feet.  Aside from the cabins the buildings will be neat and attractive structures, covered with staff.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Postoffice Department Gets Proofs from Bureau of Engraving.</head>
                            <p>Samples of three of the exposition memorial postage stamps have been received at the Postoffice department from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.  These were the 1-cent, 4-cent and $2 stamps.  All of the stamps will be of two colors, the picture in the center being printed in black and the border being in color.  The rules of the International Postal union will be observed as to the color of the stamps, where they apply.  Under these rules the 1-cent stamp will have a green border, the 2-cent will be red and the 5-cent a dark blue.  The colors of the other stamps will be regulated by the Postoffice department.</p>
                            <p>The 1-cent exposition stamp bears a view of Marquette discovering the Mississippi and represents Marquette sitting in his priestly robes in the midst of a group of Indians in war paint and feathers, with the great "Father of Waters" in the background.</p>
                            <p>The 4-cent stamp represents an Indian hunting buffalo and is taken from a steel engraving in Schoolcraft's "Indian Tribes."  A magnificent specimen of the bison is shown in full gallop, with an Indian astride a pony close upon his heels, the savage having his bow and arrow in action.</p>
                            <p>The $2 stamp is entitled "Harvesting in the West," and represents a farmer operating a four-horse plow.</p>
                            <p>The color to be given the 4-cent stamp and the $2 stamp has not yet been determined.  As soon as this is decided the stamps will be printed and put on sale.</p>

                            <p>The loss to the banks of St. Louis on account of the forged drafts on Omaha parties presented to the banks by a man calling himself William Elliott, who was in St. Louis last fall as a representative of the exposition, has been made good by the full payment to the banks by the exposition management of the amount secured by Elliott.  Elliott came to Omaha and succeeded, by means of a good address and oily manners, in securing a berth as the representative of the exposition in St. Louis.  He carried letters of recommendation from numerous Omaha parties and was shown every courtesy by the business men of St. Louis.  In return he presented two drafts, which were cashed, Elliott receiving $400.  The drafts proved to be forgeries, and the exposition management was asked to reimburse the banks for the loss on account of its agent.  The matter was carefully considered, and it was decided, on account of the friendly interest in the exposition manifested by the people of St. Louis, to pay the money, and this has been done.</p>

                            <p>Musical Director Kimball reports that all arrangements have been completed for the band music of the exposition during the first three months it will be open.  The organization which will furnish the outdoor music of the exposition will be among the very finest musical organizations in the world.  Prominent among this class stands the famous United States Marine band, acknowledged to be one of the most efficient organizations of its kind:  This band will play on the exposition grounds for a period of five weeks, an engagement for the full band having been closed by telegraph yesterday.  The Bellstedt-Ballenberg band of Cincinnati, an organization of fifty men, will play a four weeks' engagement.  Phinney's United States band of Chicago will appear for four weeks, with forty-five men, and the famous Mexican band of seventy pieces will play an engagement of six weeks.  This will carry the music to about August 1, and in the meantime negotiations are in progress for other organizations.</p>
                            <p>The Theodore Thomas orchestra has been engaged, as heretofore announced, for a period of five weeks to play in the Auditorium with the privilege on the part of the exposition of extending the engagement.</p>
                            <p>Director Kimball has gone to Chicago on business in connection with the musical department.</p>

                            <p>A meeting of real estate men from all parts of North Dakota has been called to meet at Fargo, April 21, for the purpose of considering ways and means for making an exhibit at the exposition.  The call for the meeting has been issued by Colonel C. A. Lounsberry, vice president of the exposition for that state.  He estimates that the cost of making an exhibit will be from $6,000 to $10,000, of which amount several counties have already pledged a portion.  The six counties in the Red River valley have been asked to contribute $250 each and the western counties according to their ability, while the state is asked to contribute $1,000 from the emergency fund.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><unclear reason="cut off"/>the Ethical Work of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>It begins to look as though one marked feature of the gatherings to be held in this city during the exposition would be a Congress of Religious Activities.  A meeting was held Monday afternoon at the Commercial club rooms, when the general idea of the gathering was presented to the laymen who assembled.  They instantly recognized and heartily approved the scope and breadth of the plan.</p>
                            <p>As stated, the project includes a setting forth, by prominent men of all shades of belief, the various ways in which the religious spirit of the age is making itself felt.  The plan, while exceedingly flexible and capable of contraction or expansion as might seem best, suggested the consideration of these seven departments of religious activity: (1) Missionary, (2) Philanthropic, (3) Social, (4) Interdenominational, (5) Temperance, (6) Educational, (7) General Reforms.</p>
                            <p>The World's Congress of Religions brought into prominence the beliefs of different religious bodies, but the idea now in mind is to call attention to the activities which are the product of the religious spirit.  This is peculiarly a western notion, for here we emphasize deeds more than creeds.  It was conceded by those who conferred that such a congress would interest a very large number in this transmississippi region and might be made the leading feature of the congress work.  It was the opinion of those who met that with such a plan carefully arranged the leading speakers of the country could be brought here and permanent good would result.</p>
                            <p>Another meeting will be held on Friday evening at 8 o'clock in the room of the directors of the exposition, sixth floor of Paxton block, when it is hoped that those interested will be present to consider the whole scheme.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Getting Things in Shape to Begin Work of Construction.</head>
                            <p>The construction of the big wigwam was the sole subject of discussion at the meeting of the Transmississippi association last night.  The chief element of contention was the manner in which the work was to be done.  It was decided that the building committee should make all of the contracts for material, and call for bids from contractors to do the work.  A resolution was passed instructing the building committee to advertise for bids to be in by Monday, in time to present to the meeting of the <choice><sic>associatiton</sic><corr>association</corr></choice> on that evening, and that the bidders should be restricted to residents of this county.</p>
                            <p>The question of the grand stairway contemplated in the original plans was referred back to the building committee, with instructions to decide upon the matter in some way that would permit the contractors to bid intelligently upon the work to be done.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the general character of the wigwam should be "a comfort home" for the use of the people of Pottawattamie county when they visited the exposition, where they could stop and rest, eat their lunches and have packages checked without cost.  It was not definitely decided whether this "general comfort room" should be located on one of the upper floors or be given a prominent location on the ground floor.  This will be definitely determined by the decision concerning the stairway and elevator.  The building committee, however, was instructed to provide offices and check rooms on the ground floor, of easy access to visitors.  Colonel W. F. Baker, member of the Board of County Supervisors, was present and received a vote of thanks of the association to the county board for the liberal donation.  Colonel Baker and President Graham were also added to the building committee.</p>
                            <p>A resolution was passed instructing each member of the committee on exhibits to provide himself with a diagram of the ground floor for the purpose of offering space to exhibitors with orders to make an active canvass for the sale of as much space as possible.  It was decided to require a bond of $500 from each of the contractors submitting bids to do the construction work on the building.</p>
                            <p>General E. F. Test submitted a resolution instructing the association to ask the city council to appropriate $1,000 from the water fund to be used for sprinkling and other purposes in connection with the maintenance of the wigwam.  The resolution was referred to George F. Wright for further consideration.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Judson reported that the women who had generously assisted the association in its work of raising funds had arranged for an entertainment at the Dohany theater on Thursday night, when a series of fine stereopticon views of Cuba and the war ships will be shown.  It was decided that no further action should be taken concerning the other projected entertainments until the next meeting, and to relieve the women of their work if it was found enough money was in sight to meet all of the obligations of the association.</p>

This building is designed for headquarters of each of the departments of the exposition and the north wing of the building <unclear reason="cut off"/> emergency hospital.  The visiting newspaper men are also provided with spacious quarters in the proposed structure.  The bids were as follows: Carpenter work&#8212;Westlake Construction company, $9,890; George Moore &amp; Son, $12,350; John Rasmussen, $12,255.  Staff work&#8212;F. A. Seiffert, $2,793; Smith &amp; Eastman, $3,585.  The bids were referred to a special committee to confer with the architects with a view of cutting down the expense of the building.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed was authorized to make contracts with W. T. Higgins for the sale of sea shells and shell goods in the Liberal Arts building; with George T.

                            <div3>
                            <p>The board of directors of the exposition association held an adjourned session yesterday afternoon which was attended by a bare quorum of the members.  A marked feature of the meeting was an attack upon the executive committee by G. M. Hitchcock in line with the charges which have appeared in the editorial columns of his paper and the refutation of these charges by Mr. Rosewater, who compelled Mr. Hitchcock to acknowledge that he had deliberately misrepresented the matter and was, furthermore, not in a position to cry "fraud" at anyone.</p>
                            <p>When the meeting opened Mr. Rosewater brought up the subject of hotel accommodations, calling the attention of the directors to the necessity for increased accommodations in view of the large numbers of people who will visit the city and who will demand first-class accommodations.  He said it will be necessary to provide such accommodations for fully 1,500 or 2,000 people and he advocated the erection of a temporary building of that capacity in a central location.  He said he had conferred with the owners of the vacant block bounded by Dodge, Douglas, Eighteenth and Nineteenth streets, and they had agreed to allow the property to be used for a temporary hotel 
                            
                            <pb n="81" xml:id="TMISB04-081"/>
                            
                            building at a small rental.  Following this, Mr. Rosewater said he had sent for a Chicago architect who is an expert on hotel construction and this man has inspected the ground and had drawn complete plans and specifications for a temporary building, to be covered with staff or corrugated iron and plastered on the inside, with capacity to accommodate about 2,000 guests.  A large number of the rooms planned for bath rooms, and at a flat rate of $2 per day would easily pay all the expenses of the establishment and leave a profit, without counting the income from the barber shops, restaurants and various other establishments which would be accommodated in the building.</p>
                            <p>In the discussion which followed on this matter Mr. Rosewater said such a building could be erected for about $75,00 and the furnishing would cost about $20,000 more, making a total investment of about $100,000.</p>
                            <p>The matter was very favorably regarded by the directors present and a committee of five was appointed to take up the matter and report at the next meeting of the board, to be held Friday afternoon of this week, the best manner of proceeding to carry out the suggestion.  The chair appointed as this committee Directors Rosewater, Dudley Smith, Kilpatrick, Wilcox and Rector.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HITCHCOCKS RESOLUTION.</head>
                            <p>When this matter was disposed of Mr. Hitchcock took the floor to offer the following resolution:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this board of directors that the executive committee shall not enter into any contract or let any concession in which any member of the committee is directly or indirectly interested.</p>
                            <p>When the resolution was stated by the president Mr. Rosewater said that when the matter which the author of the resolution was firing at was before the house at the last meeting he had made a full explanation of the whole matter, but he said there might be some present who had not heard that explanation and who would like to know whether the executive committee had made a gift to one of its members or whether the committee had violated the rules which obtain in all large corporations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said the transaction referred to was just as legitimate as the transaction when Mr. Hitchcock had voted to purchase from Mr. Kountze, a member of the board of directors, a tract of land for the exposition, or the transaction where the executive committee had paid Mr. Hitchcock three times as much per copy for a lot of his papers as was proposed to be paid for the copies of The Weekly Bee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then again went over the circumstances leading up to the action which has resulted in such extended comment at the hands of Mr. Hitchcock.  He stated that the experience of other expositions had demonstrated that a very large percentage of the expected attendance would come from the territory within a radius of 250 miles from Omaha.  To reach this population several methods had been pursued; the people in the cities and towns along the railroads had been reached by these roads and well supplied with the pamphlets issued by the Department of Publicity and Promotion.  But the farmers living in this territory could only be reached by mail, and this brought the whole question down to a simple problem of cost.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COST OF THE PUBLICATION.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then stated briefly the items of cost in the issuance of an edition of 200,000 copies of the thirty-two page pamphlet which has been issued by the department, including the cost of the pamphlets at $750 for each 100,000 postage at 1 cent each, $2,000; addressing, $200; envelopes and addressing, $300 or $400 more, making the total cost of this method $4,200.  The committee had decided to adopt the method of sending out the exposition matter in the form of the regular edition of a newspaper in order to take advantage of the pound rate of postage and to get more printed matter concerning the exposition.  It had decided to purchase 200,000 copies of The Weekly Bee, including a four-page supplement on fine paper, for $3,200 mailed, or $1,000 less than the cost of the pamphlets.  Mr. Rosewater repeated the items of cost of the supplement in question, showing that a small margin of $60 or $70 would be left the publisher at the price of $3,200.  He refuted the charges made by Mr. Hitchcock in his paper that the purchase of these papers was an act of highway robbery and challenged Mr. Hitchcock to explain how is happened that the exposition had been induced to buy copies of his paper, printed on poor paper, at over 6 cents a copy, when The Bee proposed to furnish a paper printed on superior paper for 1 3-5 cents.  He declared that it might as well be said that no banker who is a member of the board of directors should loan the exposition money, or that no merchant who is a director should sell any material to a third party to be used in connection with the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MR. HITCHCOCK'S ARGUMENT.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock followed Mr. Rosewater.  He exclaimed with great force that the matter had not been fairly presented, charging that the situation and the conditions which had called forth the resolution were radically opposite to the conditions when the exposition purchased from Mr. Kountze the tract of land for a park and for the exposition.  He charged that Mr. Rosewater had used his position as a member of the executive committee to buttonhole the other members of the committee and to threaten and cajole them into doing his bidding.  He said the members of the executive committee had been wheedled and cajoled into accepting Mr. Rosewater's suggestion, after which Mr. Rosewater had left town.  No sooner was his back turned, according to Mr. Hitchcock, than the committee completely receded from this position and rescinded its action.  The day following Mr. Rosewater's return to the city he again wheedled and cajoled and buttonholed his colleagues on the committee, according to Mr. Hitchcock, and they obediently got into line again on the proposition.</p>
                            <p>At this recital Mr. Rosewater demanded that Mr. Hitchcock produce one man whom he had "buttonholed" regarding the matter, or one member of the committee who had been "cajoled" or influenced in any manner.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock "took water" on this proposition and turned the discussion into another attempt on the part of Mr. Rosewater to "raid the treasury," and he charged that if it was allowed to go on no paper could be expected to give the exposition free advertising.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater endeavored to get Mr. Hitchcock to admit or deny the reasonableness of the price asked for the 200,000 copies of The Weekly Bee and supplement, but Mr. Hitchcock declared that the question of cost did not enter into the question, as it was a principle he was contending for.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CORNERS THE KICKER.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then demanded why Mr. Hitchcock had insisted on the exposition taking a lot of copies of the World-Herald at an exorbitant price when he is a member of the Board of Directors.  He said that Mr. Hitchcock was afflicted with an incurable attack of Rosewaterphobia and had endeavored to make capital out of the incident simply because Rosewater was concerned, and if any harm came to the exposition from the circumstance Hitchcock would be responsible for it.  In conclusion Mr. Rosewater said that not a cent had ever been expended by him in connection with the exposition for which a voucher was not on file with the name of the person to whom it was paid, but he challenged Mr. Hitchcock to say the same for the affairs of the department which had been under his charge, asking what had been done with a certain $200 which Mr. Hitchcock to say the same for the affairs of the department which had been under his charge, asking what had been done with a certain $200 which Mr. Hitchcock had drawn and refused to tell any of the committee to whom it went.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock turned white with ill-concealed rage and excitedly exclaimed that the president had approved the voucher, but he failed to state what had been done with the money.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rector asked if the resolution would be retroactive if adopted.  The president ruled that the resolution would not be retroactive.</p>
                            <p>A motion to refer the resolution to the executive committee was followed by a request from Chairman Lindsey that the board act on the matter, instead of referring it to the committee.</p>
                            <p>The matter was finally put to a vote, after it had been amended to provide that the words "without advertising for bids" should be added, and the resolution was adopted.</p>
                            <p>The board adjourned until 4 p. m. Friday of this week.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BARGAIN SALE ON TICKETS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee Devises a Plan to Help Both Sides.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition has authorized the issuance of commutation admission tickets to the exposition and people who desire to profit by the opportunity may now secure tickets to the great fair at a rate much below the price at which tickets will be sold when the exposition opens.  As a preliminary to this movement it has been decided by the committee that the exposition grounds shall be kept open from 8 o'clock a. m. to 11 o'clock p. m., tickets to be on sale from the hour of opening until 10 p. m.  The price of admission to the grounds, either night or day, has been fixed at 50 cents.</p>
                            <p>The commutation tickets which have been placed on the market are in the shape of a book containing 100 single admission coupons.  These tickets are nontransferrable, each buyer of a book being required to have his photograph pasted on the inside of the cover, and the coupon tickets will not be accepted if detached from their book.</p>
                            <p>These commutation tickets are now on sale and can be purchased at $20 each, making the price of admission to a holder of one of these books 20 cents.  The tickets may be obtained of Secretary Wakefield at exposition headquarters until May 1.</p>
                            <p>One object of the exposition management in placing these tickets on sale at this time is to turn into the exposition treasury the money which is expected to be realized in this way.  It is the expectation of the management that there will be a very active demand for these tickets on the part of people in the section of territory adjacent to Omaha, as it offers them an excellent opportunity for securing cheap admission to the exposition and enables them to lend a helping hand to the enterprise at a time when ready cash is most acceptable.  Secretary Wakefield is prepared to receive all comers with $20, either in currency or in the form of a check and he anticipated a rush to take advantage of the great bargain sale.</p>
                            <p>In addition to ordering these tickets placed on sale, the executive committee authorized Manager Reed to enter into several contracts with applicants for concessions.  These were U. G. Graham, who will operate the gondolas and a naphtha launch on the lagoon; Margaret B. Cook of Omaha, who will erect a log cabin on the Midway and operate therein a New England bean house; and the Nebraska Telephone company, which will establish a number of pay telephone stations on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The committee also authorized Manager Kirkendall to contract for another power engine from the manufacturer in Hamilton, O.</p>

                            <p>Fraternal orders are taking a lively interest in the exposition and great preparations are being made by them to be represented in a manner which will be in keeping with their position in the business world.  Many of them are going to contribute liberally to the erection of "Fraternal Building," in which they will have commodious headquarters.  Nearly enough associations have now indicated a desire to have headquarters in the building on the grounds to justify its erection.  Before active work commences, however, F. F.

                            <head type="sub">A REBUKE ADMINISTERED.</head>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the board of directors that the executive committee should not enter into any contract or let any concession in which a member of the committee is directly or indirectly interested without first advertising for bids.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater made a bitter fight, but the board of directors of the exposition yesterday adopted the above resolution.</p>
                            <p>Only three directors joined Mr. Rosewater in voting against it.</p>
                            <p>The effect of the resolution is two-fold:</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;It conveys a censure to the members of the committee for their weakness in allowing Mr. Rosewater to stick his fingers so deep into the exposition treasury.</p>
                            <p>Second&#8212;It will serve to render it difficult to make a similar raid in the future.</p>
                            <p>It is rather extraordinary, to say the least, that it should be necessary for the board of directors to notify the six men on its executive committee not to let contracts to themselves.</p>
                            <p>It is also extraordinary that a member of the committee should stand up before his brother directors and protest against being forbidden to put exposition money into his own pocket.</p>
                            <p>Had the executive committee responded to the World-Herald's warning, and rescinded its action, it might have saved itself being put in this embarrassing position.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Very Warm Argument in Which Mr. Rosewater Is Forced to Listen to a History of His Treasury Raids.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the board of directors that the executive committee should not enter into any contract or let any concession in which a member of the committee is directly or indirectly interested, without first advertising for bids.</p>
                            <p>By the adoption of the above resolution by a practically unanimous vote, the board of directors of the exposition yesterday afternoon expressed their opinion of the action of Mr. Rosewater and his associates on the executive committee in voting $3,200 of exposition money into Mr. Rosewater's pockets.</p>
                            <p>All things considered, it was a very disagreeable afternoon for the manager of the department of publicity and promotion, and forcibly recalled that other afternoon a few months ago when the same Mr. Rosewater was forced to place his abdomen on the ground and wiggle for the satisfaction and edification of the same board of directors.  For some reason or other, the board seems to be possessed of an unholy desire to make Mr. Rosewater do things that he does not want to do, and to restrain him from doing the things which he has set his heart on doing.  What Mr. Rosewater said about it after the proceeding was over cannot be stated, because Mr. Rosewater was too mad to talk, and what he thought about it cannot be reproduced because it was not fit to print.  Some things must be left to the imagination.</p>
                            <p>The matter came up at the adjourned meeting of the board, which had been arranged for by Mr. Rosewater for the purpose of building a hotel and negotiating an exposition loan.  The hotel was not built and the loan has not been negotiated, but neither of these facts is responsible for the load of grief that accompanied Mr. Rosewater to bed last night.  It was due to the fact that the strongly expressed sentiment of one of the most thoroughly representative business bodies in the city threatened to pry him loose from the exposition treasury.</p>
                            <p>The hotel scheme was disposed of by the appointment of a committee consisting of Messrs. Rosewater, Dudley Smith, Kilpatrick, Wilcox and Rector.  These gentlemen will look into the proposition to build a hotel four stories high, covering the entire block, bounded by Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Douglas and Dodge streets.  It was stated that Mr. Frank Murphy has secured the consent of Messrs. Hanscom and Denise to the use of the land for the purpose, and that plans had been drawn on which bids could be secured.  The estimated cost was announced as $75,000, and $20,000 more would furnish the building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ROSEWATER MONEY GRAB.</head>
                            <p>Under the head of miscellaneous business, Mr. Hitchcock brought up the Rosewater money grab.  He spoke of the provision of the by-laws which prohibited any director drawing a salary or receiving any compensation, and offered the above resolution, moving its adoption.  It was promptly seconded, and the president announced it open for discussion.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kilpatrick called for information as to its purport.  Mr. Rosewater found the shoe such a perfect fit that he immediately put it on, laced it up and walked off with it.  He said: "The matter that Mr. Hitchcock is trying to bring in here is a special grievance of his own.  If it had been brought in here in good faith and was of a general character I suppose there would have been no objection to its consideration."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then paused to give someone a chance to raise a point of order by which the obnoxious resolution could be disposed of without further discussion, but he waited in vain, and was forced to go ahead.  He insisted that there was nothing out of the way in paying money to a director, and said that it had been done in the case where Mr. Kountze was interested in the selection of the site for the exposition, and that a number of World-Heralds had been bought by the exposition management.  He was especially emphatic in declaring that the World-Herald had been paid 6 cents each for papers that were "very much inferior" to the one he proposed to get out.</p>
                            <p>He then defended his action in trying to get hold of $3,200 exposition money by saying that the price he charged was not exorbitant he contended that it would cost $4,200 to get out the same matter in pamphlet form, and that the executive committee had "wisely decided to save $1,000 by buying 200,000 copies of the Weekly Bee."  He denied that he had hypnotised the executive committee, and expressed the belief that no director could favor the resolution "under the circumstances."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DIFFERENT PROPOSITIONS.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock replied that the proposition had not been fairly stated.  He said the conditions existing were radically different from those under which arrangements were made with Mr. Kountze for the exposition site.  Mr. Kountze was not a member of the executive committee and he had not stood knocking at the door of the executive committee and he had not stood knocking at the door of the executive committee or buttonholing its members to get them to buy five or ten, or twenty, acres of his land at his own figures and on his own terms.  On the other hand, the board had gone to him to ask for a proposition, and it was the same with the World-Herald.</p>
                            <p>"When I issued the special exposition number of the World-Herald," said My. Hitchcock, "I did not ask the exposition to buy a copy or spend a dollar in connection with it.  Several days after it was issued the secretary, Mr. Wakefield, came to me and asked for a price on a number of them.  I made a price 40 per cent lower than the one at which we were selling to others.  I lost several hundred dollars on that edition, but I was glad to do it for the benefit of the exposition and for the state and city.</p>
                            <p>"Now, how is it in this case?  This man has been buttonholing and cajoling and wheedling his associates on the executive committee until he got their permission to enter into a contract with himself to divert $3,200 of these exposition trust funds to his own use."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater had shown symptoms that his chair was getting hot, and he jumped up and demanded that Mr. Hitchcock name the member whom he had buttonholed.  He was ready to plead guilty to wheedling and cajoling, but he balked at the buttonholing.</p>
                            <p>"You went into that secret meeting," continued Mr. Hitchcock, "and there urged the matter by every means within your power, and secured the assent of the committee.  Then you left the city, and what did the committee do?  The very next day it rescinded its action.  Then you returned, and again you besought it with your importunities, and again you secured its consent to take this money from the exposition.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">A LITTLE SECRET HISTORY.</head>
                            <p>"A number of times since this enterprise was put under way I have had matters suppressed in the World-Herald in the interest of the exposition.  There have been a number of things in connection with the happenings before the executive committee that are probably unknown to a majority of the members of the directory.  More than a year ago, while I was still a member of the executive committee, a representative of the Bee appeared before the committee and endeavored to have the exposition take 50,000 copies of an exposition number of the Bee that it was proposed to issue at 5 cents a copy, making $2,500."</p>
                            <p>Again Mr. Rosewater was unable to restrain his uneasiness, and he hopped to the front and declared that he had not tried to sell the exposition 50,000 copies at 5 cents apiece.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock was emphatically  positive, and reiterated the statement asserting his certainty that the price demanded was $2,500.  Mr. Rosewater looked around the room, but he received no help even from the members of the executive committee, who remembered the interesting occasion fifteen months ago, when Rosewater complained in the meeting of the committee that Mr. Hitchcock was always "picking on him," when Mr. Hitchcock replied, "I am not, and have not been picking on you; I am simply trying to make you let the exposition money alone, and I serve notice on you here and now that whenever I catch you trying to get your fingers into the exposition treasury I shall rap your knuckles."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">RAID HEADED OFF.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater settled down on his hard-bottomed chair and Mr. Hitchcock continued: "When you tried to get that deal through I stated to the committee that it was an indecency for the committee to vote money into the pockets of its members&#8212;money which was placed in the hands of the committee as trust funds, contributed by people of the city who could ill afford to part with it.  A member of the committee stated then that a contract could also be made with the World-Herald, and I retorted that I would not permit it.  I said that such a thing would be gross indecency, and I would not tolerate it.  That raid was headed off.</p>
                            <p>"After that you again brought up the matter of selling the Bee to the exposition, and demanded that the committee subscribe for 400 copies a day for a year, paying for each at the rate of $4 per year, or $1,600."</p>
                            <p>Once more Mr. Rosewater rose to the surface with a denial.  He said he had not demanded the purchase of 400 copies at $4 per year, and called on Secretary Wakefield for corroboration.  The secretary thought a minute and slowly said: "I do not remember exactly about the number, whether it was 400 or not, and I don't know as I could say it was a demand," emphasizing the word "demand."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater again subsided, and Mr. Hitchcock resumed: "It was urged by you on the representation that 400 western papers wanted to get the Bee in exchange and you wanted the exposition to foot the bill.  Now my contention is this: Leaving entirely out of the question the matter of whether this price charged is reasonable or not, the exposition cannot afford to take such a step.  It cannot afford to have it go out to the papers all over this section that they are asked to devote space to the executive committee is paid several thousand dollars for what he prints in his paper about the exposition.  If such a step is persisted in it will result in closing the columns of nine-tenths of them against the exposition.  It will inflict a damage to the exposition that could not be measured by $100,000.  The way this exposition must be advertised in the main is by free advertising, and the only was to secure free advertising is to place all papers on an equal basis and see to it that they are kept there.  If it goes out that the exposition has money to pay one paper and not others, then there will be no more free advertising done."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater stepped off the skillet with alacrity and declared that Hitchcock was afflicted with Rosewaterphobia, and that it was an incurable disease.  He said Hitchcock had already done everything he could to injure the exposition, and had stigmatized the management as scoundrels.  He insisted that he himself had shown all the way through that he had no desire to make a dollar off the exposition, and then, in an injured tone of voice, he said that no one had tried to stigmatize Hitchcock when he was a member of the executive committee.  He wound up with an insinuation that Hitchcock had not accounted for the money that was paid out for the work of his department.</p>
                            <p>"What money do you mean?" demanded Mr. Hitchcock.</p>
                            <p>"Oh, there was $200 expenses at Lincoln that I could never find out about," remarked Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>"It all received the O. K. of the president and he had full information regarding it," was the answer.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Weller moved to refer the resolution to the executive committee, but Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Babcock, who are members of the committee, wanted to unload the responsibility on the full board.  They wanted information as to what the big board thought, and they got it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater made a closing plea against the adoption of the resolution, stating that it would hamper the work of the committee.  By way of illustrating how it would interfere, he said: "Suppose for instance that we wanted to make a contract with a special journal or magazine, say Frank Leslie's.  If we advertised for bids and somebody else bid lower how could we get anything in Leslie's?"</p>
                            <p>Mr. Payne very promptly informed him.  "Frank Leslie is not a member of the executive committee, Mr. Rosewater," he said, "and this resolution is simply designed to prevent members of the executive committee voting the exposition's money into their own pockets."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater explained the disadvantages of the resolution no further.</p>
                            <p>The original resolution did not have the closing words, "without advertising for bids," and these were added by Mr. Smith, with the consent of Mr. Hitchcock.  In that shape the resolution was adopted by a viva voce vote, Mr. Rosewater and three sympathizers voting in the negative.</p>
                            <p>The directors were so well satisfied with what they had done that they concluded to call it a day's work, and adjourned forthwith to meet again next Friday afternoon at 4 o'clock.</p>

                            <head type="sub">REPRESENT ART AND LITERATURE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Mrs. Ford Reports Great Success as the Result of Her Trip to Chicago to Confer on Congresses.</head>
                            <p>Arrangement for the Art congress and the Literature congress have reached an advanced stage as a direct result of the visit to Chicago of Mrs. Frances M. Ford, secretary of the Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition.  Mrs. Ford's errand to Chicago was to consult with Lorado Taft, chairman of the Art congress, and Hamlin Garland, chairman of the Literature congress.</p>
                            <p>The Art congress will be held during the last week in September.  Monday will be devoted to architecture, interior decoration will be considered on Tuesday, ceramics on Wednesday, while painting and sculpting will occupy the remaining three days of the week.  On the program will appear the names of Francis Brown and Mr. Clarkson, well known in the art world, and Mr. Taft will give his well known "clay talk," illustrating his remarks by modelling a bust in clay.</p>
                            <p>The week following the Art congress will be devoted to the Literature congress.  Mr. Garland is about to start for the Klondike, but says he will return in time to take charge of the congress.  The program outlined by him is designed to show the evolution, the present status and future of American literature, with especial attention to the western literary movement.  Mr. Garland announces that he hopes to have on the program James Whitcomb Riley, Opie Reed, George W. Markham, Charles F. Lummis, Dr. Richard Burton, Henry D. Fuller, Harriet Monroe and many other celebrities in the literary world.</p>
                            <p>While in Chicago Mrs. Ford attended a meeting of a very exclusive club or literati and people "who have done something."  The congress was later broached by Mr. Garland, who outlined what is proposed to be done, and Mrs. Ford was subjected to a running fire of questions.  She says that she was greatly surprised and gratified to witness the enthusiasm and interest displayed in the matter by the entire company.  She modestly attributes this to the masterly manner in which Mr. Garland laid the matter before his associates.  All present expressed the most hearty approval of the idea and predicted a large measure of success of both congresses, promising to lend the matter their substantial support and to attend the meetings.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Ford says she has every reason to feel greatly encouraged by the success of her conference with all of these people, and she feels confident that these two congresses will be more than successful.</p>
                            <p>In addition to these congresses, Mrs. Ford has been advised of another meeting which will be worthy of the name of a congress.  Mrs. Longstreth of Philadelphia, a woman with a national reputation in connection with women's clubs, has notified Mrs. Ford that a party of twenty delegates to the biennial meeting of the National Federation of Woman's Clubs to be held in Denver in June, will stop in Omaha en route to Denver, and will spend Saturday and Sunday, June 18 and 19, in this city.  A meeting will be held Saturday afternoon at which three women of this delegation <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> furnish the program.  These will be Mrs. Longstreth, Mrs. Cornelius Stevenson and Mrs. Mary E. Mumford.

                            All are well known in connection with the work of woman's clubs and Mrs. Ford says they will undoubtedly attract a large number of people.  The place of holding this meeting has not been determined.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Groups to Represent a Life that is Now No More.</head>
                            <p>Small sketches in clay have been designed for statuary designed to be placed in the main court.  These statues represent groups of a distinctively western type and they are intended to be placed on the large pedestals afforded by the inclined plane and grand staircase on the south side of the lagoon west of the Mines building and on the north side for the lagoon west of the Machinery building.</p>
                            <p>The groups are designed to represent the red man and the white man as both were known to the rolling prairies of the west twenty-five years ago.  The first group represents a typical Indian chief standing erect at the head of his "cayuse."  The Indian is dressed in buckskin and feathered headdress extending to his heels, and holds in front of him a rifle.  The pony is standing with nose extended and across his back is thrown a dead elk.  The second group represents a typical western cowboy.  He, too, is dismounted and standing at the head of his broncho.  He is dressed in the regulation cowboy garb with huge spurs, buckskin breeches, revolvers, etc.  On the back of his broncho is a huge cowboy saddle with a rifle in the sling and the usual accoutrements of a cowboy strapped to the saddle.</p>
                            <p>These <choice><sic>groops</sic><corr>groups</corr></choice> were modeled by R. W. Bock, a Chicago sculptor, who is now in Omaha making the statuary for some of the main exposition buildings.  They will be submitted to the exposition management for approval, and, if adopted, will be mounted in position when the exposition opens.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plan Suggested by Manager Rosewater Receives Endorsement.</head>
                            <p>The Board of Directors of the exposition will hold an adjourned meeting at 4 o'clock <choice><sic>tomorro wafternoon</sic><corr>tomorrow afternoon</corr></choice> for the purpose of receiving <choice><sic>th ereport</sic><corr>the report</corr></choice> of the special committee appointed to consider the suggestion that the board take up the matter of securing additional first-class hotel facilities for the crowd, which will throng Omaha during the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The special committee has had several meetings and it is the unanimous opinion of the members that it is absolutely necessary to provide additional hotel accommodations, and the plan outlined by Manager Rosewater at the meeting of the board Tuesday of this week will be recommended to the board as a practical and desirable way out of the difficulty.  The plan provides for the erection of a temporary hotel building occupying <choice><sic>teh</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> entire block bounded by Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Dodge and Douglas streets, with accommodations for from 1,500 to 2,000 guests.  The estimated cost of this hotel, including the furnishing, is about $100,000 and the special committee has decided, after full consideration and conference with persons familiar with the hotel business that the plan is not only feasible and practical, but is a good investment.</p>
                            <p>A report to this effect will be made to the board and the committee will urge that the Board of Directors take such action as may seem advisable, either as a board or <choice><sic>individualylly</sic><corr>individually</corr></choice>, to assist in carrying out the plan and providing the accommodations <choice><sic>contemplataed</sic><corr>contemplated</corr></choice>.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant John M. Stotsenburg, military instructor at the University of Nebraska, has submitted a proposition to President Wattles for the encampment at Omaha of the University cadet battalion during eight days, beginning June 1.  According to this proposition the cadets will camp on the old Fort Omaha reservation, shelter, water, wood, straw, etc., to be furnished by the exposition, <choice><sic>to gether</sic><corr>together</corr></choice> with admission to the grounds for the members of the battalion.  On their part the cadets propose to participate in the parade on the opening day and to give the following exercises on the exposition grounds every day except Sundays: Guard mount, one drill either in the morning or evening and a dress parade each evening.  The matter will be considered by President Wattles and laid before the executive committee.</p>

                            <p>Bids for furnishing and installing the plumbing in the main buildings of the exposition will be opened by the Department of Buildings and Grounds tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>Ample space in each of the main buildings has been set apart for the installation of <choice><sic>toliet</sic><corr>toilet</corr></choice> conveniences for visitors to the exposition.

                            <p>No conclusion has yet been reached regarding the matter of making a nominal charge for the use of the toilet rooms.  Manager Kirkendall has this matter under consideration, and says he is inclined to recommend that no charge by made, but the matter has not been laid before the executive committee in a formal way.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission compressed about the entire business of its semi-monthly meeting into one session yesterday afternoon and a considerable grist of small matters was ground out.</p>
                            <p>The request of the six bodies of state societies of Free Masons and their auxiliary societies for a room for their joint use was granted, and the room in the southwest corner of the second floor of the Nebraska building was assigned to those organizations to be decorated and furnished by them.</p>
                            <p>The large room at the north end of the first floor of the building was assigned to the veteran soldiers and sailors of the state and their auxiliary societies.</p>
                            <p>The Woman's Suffrage association, the P. E. O. society, the Women's Christian Temperance union and the Women's Home Missionary society were assigned the joint use of room No. 17 at the southeast corner of the second floor.</p>
                            <p>The eleven fraternal societies which had applied for desk room in the Nebraska building were assigned space in the corners and alcoves on both the first and second floors, leaving about nine vacant space which have not been applied for.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Whitford and Poynter were appointed a committee to confer with Manager Babcock of the Transportation department regarding terminal charges on exhibits installed under the direction of the commission.</p>
                            <p>Commissioners Neville and Boydston were appointed a committee to pass upon the final estimate of the staff contractor, a question having arisen as to whether certain work provided for in the contract had been performed.</p>
                            <p>The Western Electrical company of Omaha was awarded the contract for wiring the Nebraska building for electric light, including the furnishing of the fixture, the price being $330.</p>
                            <p>Fish Commissioner Lew May submitted an estimate, as instructed at the last meeting of the board, showing the probable cost of making a fish exhibit in connection with the exhibit to be made in the Government building by the United States Fish commission.  Mr. May stated that the government commission had offered to allow the Nebraska commission to occupy several of the tanks in the <choice><sic>acquarium</sic><corr>aquarium</corr></choice> and he based an estimate on this fact, saying that $2,500 would be required to make a creditable exhibit of Nebraska fish.</p>
                            <p>Considerable discussion followed the presentation of this report, the members of the board agreeing that the condition of the funds at their disposal would not allow an expenditure of this amount.  Mr. May said, in reply to questions, that he could not promise a creditable exhibit with $1,250, and the board concluded this would be the maximum amount that could be devoted to that purpose.  It was finally decided to refuse to make any appropriation for a fish exhibit.</p>
                            <p>After passing upon a number of bills the board adjourned until April 26.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Building Committee Goes Over the Matter Carefully.</head>
                            <p>The building committee of the Pottawattamie wigwam spent a portion of the day yesterday revising the specifications of the building and getting them in a shape where the contractors can make their bids intelligently.  It was found that the architects had prepared their specifications by using the regulation form for permanent work, and had called for a character of finishing not in cognizance with the kind of a building proposed to be erected, adding greatly and unnecessarily to the expense.  For instance all nail holes were required to be puttied and all knots shellacked; floors finished in hard oil; plate glass windows; quarter-sawed yellow pine finishing, and a lot of other stuff not contemplated in the original plans.  All of this was cut out.  Nearly $300 was saved in the estimated cost of the grand stairway by the same kind of pruning.  The plans and the accompanying specifications were gotten into excellent shape and fully ready for examination by the bidders.</p>
                            <p>There will be no change in the original plans.  The building will be ninety feet high and seventy-five feet in diameter, with not less than three floors.  The upper floors will be necessary for the strength of the building and the additional cost will only involve the laying of the floors.  If it is finally decided to put in the elevator, these upper rooms will be among the most pleasant and frequently visited in the building.  The bids of the contractors will all be ready for consideration at the meeting of the general committee on Monday night.</p>

                            <p>The regular quarterly meeting of the Woman's Board of Managers of the Bureau of Education was held this morning in the directors' room at exposition headquarters.  Twenty members of the board were present.</p>
                            <p>The doings of the executive committee since the last meeting of the board were reported by Chairman Harford and Secretary Ford, who related briefly what had been done and several of the matters in prospect, all of which has been made public from time to time in the newspapers.</p>
                            <p>Reports were called for from the individual members of the board, and some of these were of particular interest.  The report of Mrs. Reed on the work accomplished in Council Bluffs was the most encouraging of all, from a financial standpoint, and drew forth a wave of subdued applause by way of approbation.  Mrs. Reed said the contribution to the Girls' and Boys' building from the women's edition of the Nonpareil amounted to $142.75, with several good accounts still uncollected, which will increase the amount several dollars.  In addition to this substantial assistance, Mrs. Reed reported that the pupils of the Council Bluffs High school had contributed $22 by subscriptions, and had given an entertainment which had netted $64.50, making a total contribution from the school of $84.50.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Towie of South Omaha reported that she had collected $90 by visiting the schools and selling copies of the Hatchet.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Field of Lincoln said 1,000 copies of the hatchet had been sold in that city.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Johnson of Crete reported a marked increase in interest among the people of her district, with small returns up to date, in the way of substantial assistance.</p>
                            <p>Miss Fyffe of Hastings said the president of the Board of Education, the superintendent of schools and the principal of the High school had thrown cold water on her efforts to interest the schools in the matter of contributing to the fund for the Girls' and Boys' building, and little had been secured from that source.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Kimball reported that she was about to send 100 copies of the Hatchet to London to be placed in a bazaar there for sale by the Dovey children, two Nebraska girls whose portraits appear in the paper with a short article regarding them.</p>
                            <p>A vote of thanks was voted by the board to Mesdames Marple, Tilden, Draper Smith and Hunter for their efforts in connection with the publishing of the Hatchet.</p>
                            <p>The balance of the time of the session was devoted to an informal discussion, during which the members of the board plied the executive committee with questions regarding various matters of detail with reference to the displaying of exhibits.</p>
                            <p>Before adjourning it was announced that the time in which entries may be made in the individual competition instituted by the board would be extended to May 1.  It was stated that the pressure brought upon the schools to turn out the work for the state exhibit at once had been so great that the children had had no time in which to prepare work for the individual competition.</p>

                            <p>The women constituting the newly appointed executive committee of the Bureau of Entertainment met in the directors' room at exposition headquarters and organized for the business before them.  Those present were Mesdames G. W. Wattles, F. P. Kirkendall, G. M. Hitchcock, C. W. Lyman, J. L. Webster, Clement Chase, W. A. Redick, H. T. Clarke, J. E. Summers, jr., and George A. Joslyn.

                            Bureau of Entertainment, which is designed to conduct the social features in connection with the proper entertainment of distinguished visitors to the exposition, providing receptions, dinners, etc.</p>
                            <p>The committee will hold another meeting in the directors' room Saturday at 3 p. m., at which time the remaining forty members of the committee will be appointed.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee, accompanied by President Wattles, visited the exposition grounds this morning for the purpose of selecting a desirable location for a suite of <choice><sic>hooms</sic><corr>rooms</corr></choice> to be fitted <choice><sic>u pas</sic><corr>up as</corr></choice> a place for extending to distinguished visitors to the exposition such courtesies as may be desirable on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>After visiting numerous places on the grounds which were suggested, the committee decided that the most desirable place seemed to be the northeast corner of the gallery of the Mines building.  This gallery is thirty-three feet in width and the portion favored by the committee includes the pavillion at the northeast corner of the building, extending from that point westward about 100 feet.  The corner pavillion is in such form that it will lend itself readily to a pretty scheme for decoration, and the portion extending along the north side of the building has long windows opening on the broad balcony, from which is afforded a full view of the beautiful grand court.</p>

                            <p>Governor Mount of Indiana has notified the Department of Publicity and Promotion that he has appointed an exposition commission to see that the interests of Indiana are properly represented at the exposition.  There are no funds available for participation by the state, but the governor writes that he will do all in his power to have steps taken to bring about the desired result.  The following is the list of commissioners: Frank B. Von Behren, Evansville; Mason J. Niblack, Vincennes; W. W. Stevens, Salem; Warder H. Hamilton, Greensburg; Claude Matthews, Clinton; Mrs. Virginia C. Meredith, Cambridge City; D. M. Parry, Indianapolis; Horace E. Kinney, Indianapolis; W. H.

                            <p>Local retail liquor dealers are waxing enthusiastic over the proposed national congress of liquor dealers they are preparing to inaugurate in August.  The most conservative of them figure that their convention will easily attract several thousand of their business associates from all over the country.  The call, which is being generally circulated over the name of William Mittelstodt, president, and Morris Karpeles, secretary of the local organization, reads:</p>
                            <p>To the Retail Liquor Dealers of the United States, Greeting:  There will be held in the city of Omaha, Douglas county, state of Nebraska, August 22 to 27 inclusive, a national congress of retail liquor dealers of the United States, for the purpose of discussing questions of personal and general interest to the retail liquor traffic.  The Municipal Retail Liquor league of the city of Omaha, acting in conjunction with the management of the exposition and Commercial club, has arranged in conjunction a program for the entertainment of all retail liquor dealers attending this congress.  The great Transmississippi and International Exposition will be at its height during the period named, and the railroad rates will be so reduced as to enable all liquor dealers to attend at nominal cost.  No retail liquor dealer should fail to attend, as this meeting is of vital interest to all.  For further particulars, address any member of the correspondence committee, viz.:  Charles Krug, 2601 South Thirteenth street; Morris Karpeles, 112 South Fourteenth street; August Stephans, 1306 Douglas street; Joe McCaffrey, 111 South Fifteenth street; C. E. Fields, 119 South Fourteenth street.</p>

The material is mostly cases, shelving, etc., for the exhibit of the Agricultural department.  Captain Ward, who has charge of all shipments for the Government building, has the bills of lading for about twenty cars of material to be installed in this building.  These are now en route and are expected to arrive within a few days.  Captain Ward says there will be about 300 cars of exhibits for the Government building and the entire lot will be shipped before May 1.</p>

Unless other arrangements be made the exposition terminal charges and the transfer charges for less than carload shipments must be paid by the shipper.  The exposition terminal charge is 6 cents per 100 pounds, and is to be prepaid at point of shipment.  There will also be a transfer charge on less than carload consignments of 6 cents per 100 pounds, with a minimum charge of $1 for any single shipment from one consignor to one consignee.  This transfer charge on less than carload consignments is for hauling goods between the local freight depots in Omaha and the exposition warehouse, and will apply in both directions.  For further information exhibitors and other shippers should see the rules and regulations issued by the Department of Transportation of the exposition under the date of April 1.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Dr. Day Appoints M. H. DeYoung Honorary Commissioner and Two for the State&#8212;Governor Budd Takes a Part.</head>
                            <p>An Associated Press telegram from San Francisco contains the information that Dr. David T. Day, the mining commissioner of the exposition, who is in San Francisco in the interest of the mining exhibit, announces that everything is favorable for an extensive mining exhibit by California.  Dr. Day is quoted as saying:  "From present indications I think I am safe in saying that California will have the best mining exhibit at Omaha that it has ever had at any exposition.  I have asked M. H. DeYoung to accept the office of honorary commissioner of mines and mining for the United States at the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and he has accepted.  Charles G. Yale and Tirey L. Ford have been appointed as mining commissioners from this state and I feel sure that these gentlemen will see that a creditable mining exhibit will be sent from California."</p>
                            <p>It is also announced from San Francisco that Governor Budd will, on Monday of the coming week, appoint a California Exposition commission to represent the state at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>This news was most gratifying to the exposition management, as the indications form California have been that the northern part of the state was disposed to do little in the way of making a display of resources.  The southern part of the state has been making energetic preparations for an extensive exhibit, but all efforts to induce the northern part to take action have heretofore been unsuccessful.  Special Commissioner R. W. Richardson was sent to the coast about two weeks ago and has been arousing the people to the importance of having the state represented in a creditable manner.  The success that has attended his efforts is indicated by the dispatch referred to.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commissioner Leeson Tells of the Display He is Preparing.</head>
                            <p>Commissioner J. J. Leeson, representative of the New Mexico Exposition commission, is in the city to make final arrangements for the installation of the New Mexico exhibit.  He reports a great increase in the interest of the people of his section in the exposition and says he must have more space in which to display the resources of the territory.  Mr. Leeson says the people of New Mexico are going to visit the exposition in large numbers, and their exhibit will be on a scale which will not give them any cause to be ashamed of it.</p>
                            <p>All in the details of the exhibit have been placed in Mr. Leeson's hands by his colleagues on the commission, and he now has thirty tons of minerals collected and ready for shipment.  Three cars have already been loaded and will be shipped within a few days.  The mineral exhibit will be most elaborate and will consist of gold, silver, copper, lead and several varieties of building stone.  Mr. Leeson is a most enthusiastic mineralogist and has a very large private collection, which will form a part of the state exhibit, and in addition to this he says he has a magnificent collection of all the varieties of minerals found in the territory.</p>
                            <p>The prehistoric exhibit from New Mexico will include specimens found among ancient ruins, together with a most interesting collection of relics of the ancient Aztecs.</p>
                            <p>In fruit, Mr. Leeson says the New Mexico display will include apples, grapes, peaches, plums and several other varieties of small fruits, while the agricultural display will include a fine collection of grains and grasses and a splendid display of sugar beets.</p>
                            <p>The territory will also have an educational display, and Mr. Leeson predicts that this portion of the New Mexico exhibit will not be the least interesting feature of the showing made.</p>
                            <p>Before returning to his home, Mr. Leeson will let contracts for the cases, shelving, booths, etc., required to make a fine showing for his territory.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Promoter of the Moorish Village and Manager Reed Get Together.</head>
                            <p>There has been some little friction during the last two weeks between the Concessions department and the concessionaire of the Moorish village, which culminated in the exposition taking possession of the buildings erected by the Moorish Village company.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed states that this action was taken because Mr. Felder, representative of the Moorish Village company, failed to file the bond called for by his contract, although he had been notified several times that a failure to do so would result in his contract being declared forfeited.  Mr. Reed said the filing of this bond was waived temporarily at the time the contract was made, as was done with several of the first contracts for 
                            
                            <pb n="85" xml:id="TMISB04-085"/>
                            
                            concessions, but he said Mr. Felder had been given ample notice that a bond must be filed.  When no bond was filed, after repeated notice, Mr. Reed said he had directed General Superintendent Foster to take possession of the buildings of the Moorish village and the contract was declared forfeited.  Before it is reinstated Mr. Reed will insist upon a clear understanding with reference to several points which have been the cause of difference between the department and the concessionaire regarding the scope of the concession.  Mr. Felder has claimed that his contract gives him the exclusive right for several specialties, chief among them being optical illusions.  The department takes issue on this point and this matter will be cleared up when a conclusion is reached.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Felder declined to enter into any extended discussion of the situation.  He says he intends to stand on his contract, and will insist on his right.  He says the giving of a bond was waived when his contract was executed, his understanding being that no bond was to be required.  He also asserts that the Concessions department has violated his contract by infringing on certain rights granted to him.</p>

                            <p>The Commercial club has started to push its scheme to raise a fund for the purpose of inducing desirable manufacturing establishments to locate in this city.  The fund is to be made up of dividends that may be distributed to subscribers to exposition stock at the conclusion of the exposition.  The scheme was suggested to the executive committee of the club by Secretary Utt and a committee favorably upon it.</p>
                            <p>The fund is to be managed by a company made up of the people who will allow their exposition dividends to be used in this way.  Stock for the amount each member puts in will be issued, but it will be nonassessable.  The fund will be invested in desirable establishments that may be desirous of coming here, but no money will be given as a bonus.</p>
                            <p>It is entirely a matter of option for exposition subscribers to join this company, but it is believed that a majority of the merchants and business men of the city will fall in with the scheme.

                            <div3>
                            <p>Little else was talked about at the annual convention of the Nebraska division of the Travelers' Protective association of America, which was held in this city yesterday, except the national convention which will occur in a couple of months.</p>
                            <p>The convention was held in the headquarters of the Traveling Men's Transmississippi club, at the corner of Sixteenth and Harney streets.  A goodly proportion of the membership of the Travelers' <choice><sic>Protectcive</sic><corr>Protective</corr></choice> association in Nebraska was present.</p>
                            <p>The meeting mapped out the outline of the plan of entertainment of the national Travelers' Protective association.  According to this, the delegates and friends will be expected to arrive in the city on Tuesday, May 31, or before.  On the afternoon of that day the wives of the local traveling men will tender a reception to the visiting feminine friends and relatives of the attend-<unclear reason="cut off"/> the delegates will be taken out to the den of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben in a body and will be initiated into the mysteries of the court of King Mondamin.  On Wednesday the Travelers' Protective association will take part in the opening of the exposition and will figure in that to a considerable degree.  On Thursday evening a reception will be tendered the visitors in the club rooms of the Transmississippi club and following this a grand ball will be given in Creighton hall.  On Friday an adjournment sine die will occur.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GIVEN TO A COMMITTEE.</head>
                            <p>Most of the details were left to a committee consisting of R. F. Hodgin, O. C. Holmes, M. Wulpi and Dudley Smith, which has complete power to make all arrangements.  The only matter of detail decided upon was that the city should be plentifully decorated with large banners of the Travelers' Protective association colors, blue and white.  Some 3,000 of these will be hung up about the city.  The division appropriated a nice sum of money to assist in this work and other entertainment.</p>
                            <p>The national Travelers' Protective association convention will be one of the big conventions of the year and will be the only one in session in the city at the time the exposition opens.  There will by only some 200 accredited delegates in attendance, but there will be thousands of other travelingmen from all parts of the country here in addition.  It is confidently expected that the total attendance attracted by the convention will be over 5,000.  The advantage of the convention will lie not only in the big number of people brought here, but also in the fact that, the majority of those present being travelingmen, they will advertise the exposition all over the country.</p>
                            <p>The division elected the following officers: A. H. Buckstaff of Lincoln, president; Dudley Smith of Omaha, first vice president; Robert Binford of Lincoln, second vice president; R. F. Hodgin of Omaha, secretary and treasurer; M. Wulpi of Omaha, delegate to the national convention; E. S. Streator of Omaha, alternate.  R. Binford of Lincoln, the retiring president, and R. F. Hodgin, secretary and treasurer, are also delegates to the national convention by virtue of their offices.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exposition Committee Disposes of the Camera Question.</head>
                            <p>As the time approaches for the opening of the exposition the letting of concessions is becoming more active and the Concessions department occupies a considerable portion of the time of the executive committee at the daily sessions.  At the meeting yesterday the committee authorized Manager Reed to enter into contracts with various parties for a number of privileges.</p>
                            <p>The exclusive privilege of regulating the use of hand cameras on the exposition grounds was let to F. A. Rinehart.  When the photograph concession was let to Mr. Rinehart the contract provided that it was not to apply to hand cameras using plates or films 4x5 inches or less in size.  The method of controlling the use of these small cameras has been under consideration for several weeks, the Concessions department being uncertain as to the best manner of disposing of the question.  The action of the committee yesterday throws the whole matter into the hands of Mr. Rinehart, who will operate it on a percentage basis.  The price of admission to the grounds for hand cameras has not yet been fixed, but will be a matter for consideration at the hands of Mr. Rinehart and the exposition management.  Pending the settlement of this feature of the matter no hand cameras will be allowed on the grounds and the issuing of "permits" for this purpose will be discontinued.</p>
                            <p>Stephen von Szinnyey was awarded two concessions, one of which will be called, "A Trip to Klondike."  Would-be passenger will enter a railway station and purchase their tickets, which will be collected by the guard and passengers will be invited to enter the train.  A railway car will be in waiting and when the passengers are seated the train will appear to start at a very rapid rate.  As a matter of fact, the car will not advance an inch, but by means of mechanical effects the scenery will appear and disappear before the eyes of the passengers.  Tunnels will be passed and the mountains will be crossed.  With rapidly falling temperature the passengers will be furnished with heavy fur wraps and will alight in the frozen regions of the Klondike.</p>
                            <p>The other concession awarded to Mr. von Szinnyey was the right to issue official certificates of visitation, being an engraved certificate bearing the visitor's name and address and his photograph, and certifying to the fact that he has visited the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Wetmore Bowen company of San Francisco was awarded the concession for selling pure, unfermented grape juice in handsome booths representing the giant trees of California.</p>
                            <p>Thomas J. Lipton of Chicago was awarded the concession for an East Indian tea house.  He will erect a typical East Indian pavilion in the main court between the Mines building and the Auditorium and will sell tea and light refreshments.</p>
                            <p>C. E. Bickford of Nebraska City was authorized to operate a concession representing a New England bean house.  He will erect a log cabin typical of the houses of the early pioneers of Maine, and in this he will dispense a large number of cold dishes such as were in vogue among the colonists, making a specialty of baked beans.  The furnishing of the house and dress of the waiters will conform to the fashions of the early days.</p>
                            <p>N. B. Post was awarded the exclusive privilege of selling walking canes on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The Concessions department was authorized to have made about twenty kiosks or small booths for the use of concessionaires in small lines, to be stationed at convenient points about the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall was authorized to retail Fisher &amp; Lawrie to make plans for a Press building for the use of representatives of newspapers and periodicals.  He was also authorized to enter into negotiations for the establishment of a hospital by making use of a cottage on the grounds for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>A contract was authorized with R. C. Strehlow for the carpenter work in connection with the installation of toilet rooms in the main buildings.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Woman's Board Extends the Time for Closing the Lists.</head>
                            <p>The individual competition among the school children of the west, instituted by the Woman's Board of Managers for the purpose of securing material of a high order for the educational exhibit of the exposition, has been productive of excellent results.  A large number of specimens of school work have been received at the office of the secretary of the Bureau of Education, but the secretary has also been in receipt of numerous requests from teachers and pupils, as well as others interested, to extend the time within which entries will be received.  It is urged that the pupils, and also the teachers, have been straining every nerve to prepare material for the state exhibits and little time has remained for the preparation of work for individual entries.  It was the intention to close the lists April 15 and to allow no more entries after the date, but in response to the pressure brought to bear it has been decided to extend the time to May 1.  According to the rules governing this competition the work awarded prizes will be placed in the exposition and it will be necessary to close the lists not later than May 1 in order to allow the work to be judged and placed in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The list of prizes has been increased by the donation by the publisher of "Arts in America" of five annual subscriptions to that publication.  This paper is issued by Mrs. T. Vernette Morse, the secretary of the Central Art association of Chicago, the institution which seeks to elevate the taste of the people in the application of artistic decoration as applied to the household.  Three of these annual subscriptions will be offered to class 4, which includes pupils between the ages of 12 and 15, for the best drawings of still life and light and shade.  The other two subscriptions will be offered to class 5, including High school pupils, for the best illustrated essay on the subject, "How to Furnish a House."</p>
                            <p>The rule requiring each entry to be accompanied by a certificate will be enforced in the competition for these prizes as well as in all other competitions.  These certificates may be had of the secretary of the Woman's board, Mrs. F. M. Ford, at exposition headquarters.</p>
                            <p>The entries which have been received in the individual competition have been especially strong in manual training exhibits.  Washington university of St. Louis has sent a large exhibit of this kind of work and a number of entries have also been received from other sources.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Bureau of Entertainment met in the directors' room at exposition headquarters yesterday afternoon to consider the matter of appointing the additional forty members of the bureau.  It was announced that nothing definite could be done in the matter of securing the portion of the gallery of the Mines building for use as a place for entertaining distinguished visitors on the exposition grounds until the return of Mining Commissioner Day, who has charge of this building.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. John L. Webster was elected vice president of the bureau, but it was decided to defer the appointment of the forty additional members until the next meeting, which will be held at the call of Mrs. Clement Chase, chairman of the executive committee.</p>

Each county in the state will be asked to raise an amount equal to three-fortieths of 1 mill on its assessed valuation.  The intention is to ask the legislature to reimburse each county for the outlay and little difficulty is anticipated in securing the necessary funds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Prospect for a Great Attraction Among the Other Exhibits.</head>
                            <p>J. N. Marsh, president of the Centerville Coal company of Centerville, Ia., was in Council Bluffs yesterday for the purpose of making arrangements for a great coal exhibit at the exposition.  The company controls thirty working mines in Appanoose and adjoining counties, and is anxious to make an exhibit that will be one of the most elaborate and attractive features of the Iowa exhibit at the exposition.  The nature of this exhibit has not been made public, but enough has been made known to indicate that its character will be something worthy of the great industry and the men who are its chief promoters in the state.  One part of the plans contemplate the erection of a coal palace on a scale of sufficient magnitude to permit the construction of a regular working mine beneath the surface, showing the methods of mining, the machinery used and the vast extent of the Iowa coal fields.</p>
                            <p>An effort is being made to induce the coal companies to construct their exhibit in the Pottawattamie wigwam.  The scheme is looked upon with considerable favor, and if sufficient room can be secured the propositions made the executive committee and the committee on exhibits may be accepted.  The wigwam will undoubtedly be selected if the state building proves too small or crowded for the successful installation of the big display now contemplated.  The company desires to get on the ground floor, but if the construction of the wigwam building shows that the second floor will be of sufficiently easy access to insure its publicity a portion of it may be selected for the purpose.  There is a disposition, however, to get into the state building for fear the coal exhibit might be robbed of a portion of its state feature if installed in the county building.  The matter will probably be discussed at the meeting of the association on next Monday evening.</p>

                            <p>An Associated Press telegram from San Francisco contains the information that Dr. David T. Day, the mining commissioner of the exposition, who is in San Francisco in the interest of the mining exhibit, announces that everything is favorable for an extensive mining exhibit by California.  Dr. Day is quoted as saying:  "From present indications I think I am safe in saying that California will have the best mining exhibit at

                            Omaha <unclear reason="torn"/>tion.  I have asked Mr. M. H. DeYoung to accept the office of honorary commissioner of mines and mining for the United States at the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and he has accepted.  Charles G. Yale and Tirey L. Ford have been appointed as mining commissioners from this state and I feel sure that these gentlemen will see that a creditable mining exhibit will be sent from California."</p>
                            <p>It is also announced from San Francisco that Governor Budd will, on Monday of the coming week, appoint a California Exposition commission to represent the state at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>This news was most gratifying to the exposition management, as the indications from California have been that the northern part of the state was disposed to do little in the way of making a display of resources.  The southern part of the state has been making energetic preparations for an extensive exhibit, but all efforts to induce the northern part to take action have heretofore been unsuccessful.  Special Commissioner R. W. Richardson was sent to the coast about two weeks ago and has been arousing the people to the importance of having the state represented in a creditable manner.  The success that has attended his efforts is indicated by the dispatch referred to.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Promoter of the Moorish Village and Manager Reed Get Together.</head>
                            <p>There has been some little friction during the last two weeks between the Concessions department and the concessionaire of the Moorish village, which culminated in the exposition taking possession of the buildings erected by the Moorish Village company.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed states that this action was taken because Mr. Felder, representative of the Moorish Village company, failed to file the bond called for by his contract, although he had been notified several times that a failure to do so would result in his contract being declared forfeited.  Mr. Reed said the filing of this bond was waived temporarily at the time the contract was made, as was done with several of the first contracts for concessions, but he said Mr. Felder had been given ample notice that a bond must be filed.  When no bond was filed, after repeated notice, Mr. Reed said he had directed General Superintendent Foster to take possession of the buildings of the Moorish village and the contract was declared forfeited. Before it is reinstated Mr. Reed will insist upon a clear understanding with reference to several points which have been the cause of differences between the department and the concessionaire regarding the scope of the concession.  Mr. Felder has claimed that his contract gives him the exclusive right for several specialties, chief among them being optical illusions.  The department takes issue on this point and this matter will be cleared up when a conclusion is reached.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Felder declined to enter into any extended discussion of the situation.  He says he intends to stand on his contract, and will insist on his rights.  He says the giving of a bond was waived when his contract was executed, his understanding being that no bond was required.  He also asserts that the Concessions department has violated his contract by infringing on certain rights granted to him.</p>

                            <p>Captain H. C. Ward, U. S. A., the representative of the board of management of the government exhibit has been shipped and will arrive in Omaha within a few days.  Some of the material included in this shipment will be of peculiar interest to visitors to the exposition, being torpedoes of various kinds and ground mines similar to the instrument of destruction which caused the wreck of the Maine.  These exhibits are shipped from the Army War college at Willet's Point and include, in addition to the mines and torpedoes, models of engineering works of various kinds, models of mortar batteries, a model of Key West harbor, about which considerable interest is now centering; a model of a depression gun battery, a model of the American lock at Sault St. Marie, the largest canal lock in the world., etc.  The shipment also includes a miscellaneous collection of small arms, including specimens of the antique as well as the most improved modern instruments of warfare.</p>
                            <p>Two cars of material for the exhibit of the fish commission are in the city and will be switched to the exposition grounds immediately.  These contain exhibits, including models, fishing apparatus, casts, stuffed specimens, etc.</p>
                            <p>Two cars of burlap for the interior decoration of the Government building have also been received and the crew of decorators will arrive early in the coming week.  There are two tons of this burlap, being 5,000 yards, forty-eight inches in width.  The entire interior of the building will be covered with this material and over this will be draped flags and emblems of various kinds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Special Agent Richardson Sends a Very Encouraging Report of the Result of His Efforts Out There.</head>
                            <p>A gratifying report of the measure of success attending the efforts of Special Commissioner R. W. Richardson in California has been received by the Department of Publicity and Promotion.  Mr. Richardson says that the prospects for a good exhibit from the entire state are more than flattering.  After securing strong endorsements from leading people in the state, recommending the appointment of a state commission, Mr. Richardson says he called upon Governor Budd and had an extended conference with him.  The result of this is contained in a letter to Mr. Richardson from the governor's private secretary, as follows:</p>
                            <p>"I am instructed by Governor Budd to inform you that after the presentation of your request that commissioners be appointed from this state to arrange for its representation at the Transmississippi Exposition, he has decided to appoint such commissioners, although no funds are available to enable them to arrange for an exhibition.</p>
                            <p>"The governor trusts that the commissioners whom he will appoint will, by their personal efforts, take such action as will be agreeable to the state of Nebraska, whose exposition the governor wishes the greatest success and which it would afford him the greatest pleasure to assist."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Richardson says this commission will probably be appointed early this week and will consist of seven of the most active men in the state.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Efforts to Force a Strike Among Carpenters and Painters.</head>
                            <p>For the past two or three weeks rumors of impending labor troubles at the exposition grounds have been in circulation among those in touch with the exposition and in labor circles.  These reports have been to the effect that the carpenters and painters were about to strike for a radical increase in the scale of wages being paid.  Some of these rumors had it that the carpenters would demand that their wages be increased from 30 cents per hour to 60 cents, and that the painters were considering a demand for an increase from 30 cents an hour to 50 or 60 cents.  Rumor also had it that a time for making the demand had been agreed upon, and that a general strike would be ordered unless the demands were complied with.</p>
                            <p>Investigation for some of the rumors, but no such radical demand as outlined above is <choice><sic>cocntemplated</sic><corr>contemplated</corr></choice> at this time.  At the three last meetings of the Carpenters' union this matter has been discussed, and at the last meeting a motion to increase the scale from 30 cents per hour to 37½ cents was defeated by a very close vote.</p>
                            <p>Conservative members of the Carpenters' union say that this matter is being agitated by men who have been in the city but a short time, and by some who have been members of a union but a short time.  One individual, in particular, belonging to the latter class, is charged with being responsible for a great deal of the loud talk that has been going on recently.  The conservative members profess to believe that the efforts of the radicals will <choice><sic>nto</sic><corr>not</corr></choice> succeed, and that they are greatly outnumbered by the men who belong in Omaha and who were parties to the agreement whereby the exposition recognized union labor and will allow the employment of none but union labor on exposition buildings in return for an agreement that the union scale wages in force at the time the stipulation was made should govern during the construction period.</p>
                            <p>The agitation among the painters has been along the same lines as that of the carpenters.  The scale of wages for painters in the agreement between the labor representatives and the exposition management was fixed at 30 cents per hour, and the effort now being made is to increase this to 37½ cents.  The situation among the painters is substantially the same as with the carpenters, and the conservative members express the belief that the agreement with the exposition will prevent any radical action being taken.</p>
                            <p>Whatever may be the outcome of the agitation among the painters, it is stated by one in position to know that this very agitation is directly responsible for the high figures in the bids submitted for painting the exterior of the exposition buildings.  The bidders were cognizant of the fact that the painters were talking about demanding a radical increase in pay and the bids were made to cover such an emergency.  The result is that these figures are so high that the idea of painting the exterior of the buildings has practically been abandoned.  The painting of these buildings would have given employment to at least 200 men who will now be at leisure to discuss the necessity of demanding higher wages.</p>
                            <p>There have been slight misunderstandings between the carpenters and certain of the concessionaires on the Midway, who insist on working overtime without paying for it.  These matters are in a fair way of adjustment, however, without serious trouble.</p>

                            <p>The prediction made several months ago by the manager of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, and reiterated frequently since that time, to the effect that when the exposition opens there will be at least thirty-five of the states and territories of this union officially represented and participating, is now verified by actual returns.  These show that all of the nineteen states in the transmississippi region and three of the territories, together with fourteen states outside of the transmississippi region, will participate officially in the exposition, making a total of thirty-six.  When the roll of the states lying west of the Great Father of Waters is called on the opening day of the great exposition of the resources of this region every state will be represented by an exhibit of its contribution to the vast treasure hours, and of the twenty-six states in the union lying outside of the transmississippi region, over half of them will answer "present."</p>
                            <p>In the last named class will appear the greatest states in the union, both in point of size and wealth, the list being as follows: Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia.</p>
                            <p>The list of states and territories in the transmississippi region which will participate in the exposition includes every state and all of the territories except Indian Territory and Alaska.  The full list is as follows: Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, California.</p>
                            <p>The list of states which will have state building on the grounds is of no mean proportions, there being an even dozen now assured, with two or three more to be heard from definitely.  The list as it now stands includes these states, a number of the buildings now being either completed or in course of construction:  Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, Montana, Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Colorado.  Two or three other states are now considering the matter of erecting a state building on the grounds, among them being New York, so that the showing of state buildings will compare more than favorably with that at the World's fair and is not eclipsed by the record of any other exposition in this country.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Building Will Be a Palace and the Exhibits Will Be Those of Which the Great State Will Be Proud.</head>
                            <p>Colonel Clark E. Carr of Galesburg, president of the Illinois Exposition commission, is in the city in attendance at the meeting of the American Maize propaganda, of which he is also president.  He visited the exposition grounds in company with Prof. Taylor, superintendent of the Horticulture bureau, and inspected the progress being made on the Illinois building.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Carr expressed great satisfaction at the brilliant prospect for a great exposition and was pleased with the handsome appearance of the nearly completed Illinois building.</p>
                            <p>"We have let a contract to Marshall Field of Chicago for decorating and furnishing the Illinois building," said Colonel Carr, "and expect to have it fitted up in excellent taste.  We have been discussing Axminster carpets, with curtains and furnishings to match, so it can be seen there will be nothing mean about the building.</p>
                            <p>"Our exhibits are going to be on a large scale.  We at first considered the matter of making a large agricultural exhibit, but concluded it would be like 'carrying coals to Newcastle,' and we will not attempt to make a great exhibit of corn and cereals, but we will make a very large exhibit of agricultural machinery of all kinds.  We also considered the idea of making a large exhibit of live stock, but the same conditions obtained in that direction as in the case of the agricultural display, we intend, however, making a most excellent showing of fine blooded stock, of which we have the finest herds in the country.  In horticulture we intend making a strong showing.  We know that we have the first state in the union in the line of horticultural products, and we intend making an exhibit that will demonstrate the truth of that statement.  This exhibit will be in charge of H. M. Dunlap of Savoy, president of our State Horticultural society and a member of the state senate.  He is making preparations for a very fine exhibit and space has been reserved for it in the Horticulture building."</p>
                            <p>In reply to a question as to how many people from Illinois will visit the exposition, Colonel Carr said:  "The people of Illinois are put out at the high rates which have been adopted by the railroads for points as far from Omaha as Illinois.  The roads have been generous for short distances, but for all points in our state the rates are too high.  If we can get fares low enough it is our intention to have a Knox college day at the exposition, when we will bring our entire institution, except the building, to the exposition.  There are about 700 students in the college, besides the faculty and officers, and these will all come.  In addition to these we have old students scattered all over the union, and especially in the west, and we intend to invite them to come to Omaha on Knox college day and help swell the crowd.  We believe a very large attendance will result from this source.  On Illinois day our governor and his staff, the mayor and city officials of Chicago, as well as the officials of all the principal cities and towns in the state, will come to your exposition.  I do not believe the exposition will have any reason to say that the people of Illinois have not shown an interest in the exposition and have not attended it in large numbers."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Will Make a Kindergarten Living Exhibit in Girls' and Boys' Building.</head>
                            <p>The idea of a kindergarten exhibit by the Omaha schools in the Boys' and Girls' building at the exposition seems likely to be carried out in spite of the objectionable item of expense which inspired some opposition among members of the Board of Education.  Secretary Ford of the Women's Board of Managers has offered the board 500 feet of floor space in the building for $400, and, although the board is not ready to spend that amount of money, the enterprise is likely to succeed with the aid of support received from other sources.  The Kindergarten Supply company, from which the supplies used in the local schools are purchased, has assured Secretary Gillan that it will be glad to co-operate in the undertaking by paying for a considerable amount of the space on condition that it is given the privilege of including an exhibit of its kindergarten specialties.  Another big school supply house has also agreed to assist in bearing the expense, and with this assistance it is expected that the entire exhibit will be undertaken.  The entire matter is in the hands of a special committee of the board, consisting of Members Thomas, Gratton and Van Gilder, and a meeting of the committee will probably be called this week.</p>
                            <p>The proposed kindergarten exhibit is distinct from the regular educational exhibit and the plan is to install a "living" exhibit.  This refers to a genuine reproduction of a kindergarten room, with the assistance of some of the pupils and teachers in that department of the local schools.  The methods of kindergarten work will thus be practically illustrated, and it is believed that this object lesson would go a good ways towards increasing the public interest in favor of kindergarten instruction.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Wigman of the manual training department of the High school has drawn a rough sketch of the space the will be required for the exhibit of that department.  He urges that action should be taken at once, as there is short time remaining in which to prepare and install the exhibit, and the special committee will probably bring in a recommendation at the next regular meeting of the board.</p>

The plans for the building were drawn by Fisher &amp; Lawrie and have been approved by the architects-in-chief, the contract has been let and work  will be commenced in a few days.</p>
                            <p>The building will be located somewhere near the Wisconsin building, not far from the restaurants which stand at the bluff tract end of the main viaduct, and one of the unique features of the exhibit will be a field of growing cotton which will surround the building instead of the customary lawn.  The drawings of the building show it to be two stories in height.  The first story is octagonal, the roof being octagonal and surmounted by a group of four papooses and four cats emerging from bags.  From the center of this group the flagstaff will rise.  In all parts of the building the cats and papooses will be used for decorative purposes, being the trade-marks used by the Bemis company.  A row of cats' heads will form the cornice and at the entrance two cats will stand guard in place of the traditional lions.  The name of the company and the different branches will appear in the exterior decoration together with the trade-marks, but they are to be used only as they can be without interfering with the architectural beauty of the structure.  The total expense will be between $2,500 and $3,000.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the building is to be in striking contrast to the pure white exterior.  Colors of all sorts will be used.  Burlap fabrics are used extensively in decorations that a great variety of materials can be had which is representative of the company's business and at the same time well adapted for draperies and wall decorations.</p>
                            <p>It is the intention of the Bemis company to make the building headquarters for all mill and grain men who attend the exposition.  Among the conveniences the building will offer will be a stock ticker, telephone and telegraph facilities, writing desks and stationery, and no pains will be spared to make visitors comfortable.  The company expects to send personal invitations to its patrons in all parts of the United States and hopes to secure a large attendance from among the milling and grain men of the country.</p>

                            <head type="sub">New Bids Must Be Submitted by Contractors.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association held a special meeting last night and made another unavailing effort to reach conclusions with the contractors concerning the construction of the wigwam.  Before the bids were opened it was discovered that a number of the bidders had based their estimates upon erroneous information that caused them to bid too high.  Others had based their bids upon a building larger than the association had contemplated building.  Under the circumstances it was deemed necessary in justice to all of them to discard all of the bids and let them try again.  For this purpose the building committee and the contractors will hold a conference this afternoon at 2 o'clock.  The new bids will be submitted at a special meeting tomorrow evening.  The contracts will then be let and the work of the building will follow as quickly as the material can be gotten on the ground.</p>
                            <p>General Test of the transportation committee reported a conference with General Manager Dickinson of the Union Pacific relative to the operation of trains from the Broadway and Ninth street station to the exposition grounds.  Mr. Dickinson was unable to say just what his road would do and asked for suggestions from the association.  General Test stated that the Terminal company was willing and anxious to put on a train system, but understood that they would be prohibited from building the necessary tracks on Union avenue to reach Broadway at Ninth street, and unless the injunction was dissolved to permit the construction of this piece of track the road could not arrange to handle the traffic.  General Test also stated that a union depot be established at Broadway and Ninth for the use of all of the roads desiring to run exposition trains.  The matter was referred back to the transportation committee for further conferences with the roads.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Judson reported that City Attorney Wadsworth had given assurances that there would be no trouble experienced in removing any legal obstacles in the way of the Terminal tracks on Union avenue.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secures a Restraining Order Against the Concessions Department.</head>
                            <p>The first lawsuit involving the exposition has been commenced, Judge Scott having issued a restraining order yesterday afternoon on the application of A. E. Felder, the concessionaire of the Moorish village, a concession on the Midway.  This order restrains the exposition authorities from interfering in any manner with the concession known as the Moorish village, and sets the matter for hearing before Judge Scott Friday morning at 10 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>This lawsuit grows out of the trouble between the Concessions department and the concessionaire of the Moorish village which developed last week.  The trouble had been brewing for some time, the exposition authorities insisting that Mr. Felder must file a bond as provided in his contract or have his contract forfeited and Mr. Felder declining to file a bond because he claimed a bond had been waived.  He also charged that the Concessions department had infringed upon his contract by selling to other concessionaires certain amusements on which he claims to have a monopoly under his contract.</p>
                            <p>Friday of last week the exposition took possession of the buildings of the Moorish village, General Superintendent Foster taking full charge and stopping all work on the buildings.  Several meetings were held between the Concessions department and Mr. Felder, but no settlement was reached, Mr. Felder being notified that unless the demands of the department were immediately complied with the concession would be relet.</p>
                            <p>The reply to this ultimatum was the application for a restraining order.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commissioners Say it Will Be the Best of All at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The county commissioners are growing enthusiastic over the exposition and the exhibit that is proposed by Douglas county.  They believe that the county is to outshine all others, both as to quantity and quality.</p>
                            <p>In speaking of the Douglas county exhibit Chairman Kierstead said:  "We don't care what others may do, we propose to have an exhibit that will be the envy of all and at the same time one that will be a convincing argument that the soil of Douglas county is more productive than the boasted valley of the Nile.  It will take money to make this exhibit, but we have the money and we propose to make our exhibit the best of any at the great show.  We have experts at work now preparing designs and they are making good progress, but are not far enough along so that one can have a correct idea of just what will be accomplished.</p>
                            <p>"We appointed R. S. Berlin as superintendent of our general exhibit and already he is getting the work well in hand.  Berlin is a great hustler and while his salary does not begin until May 1 he is hard at work formulating the plans that he will pursue in order to make our exhibit the most attractive.  We appointed Mr. Davidson superintendent of the Apiary exhibit and from him we expect good results.  Mr. Davidson was at the World's fair and it will be remembered that he took first prize on honey and supplies used by bee keepers.  J. J. Hess, who is in charge of the floral display, is an expert florist and is laying his plans to make some unusually attractive displays in the Horticultural building.</p>
                            <p>"So far as the agricultural exhibits are concerned, I can't say just what we will have, but it is safe to venture the opinion that they will be attractive and neat.  We intend to convince every person who attends the exposition that corn is king."</p>

                            <p>The original intention was to limit the membership to only native Illinoisans in the city, but it was found after a permanent organization was effected at a meeting just held that this debarred so many other Omahans who formerly claimed Illinois as their home that it was decided to admit all to membership who were residents of that state for at least five years prior to their removal to Omaha.  It was agreed that the officers who had been elected under the former rule should resign, and that a new organization should be effected under the substituted membership agreement.</p>
                            <p>Fully seventy-five Omahans have signified their intention to join the club, and those who are organizing it think that with the new membership privilege the society will number at least 250 members.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary of the State Horticultural Board Calls on the Citizens to Shake Off Their Apathy and Make a Showing.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Mrs. Martha A. Shute, secretary of the Colorado State Horticultural society and a member of the Colorado Exposition commission, has reached her home in Denver and has opened her batteries on the apathetic people of the Centennial state in a manner which threatens to smoke some of them out in short order.  Mrs. Shute spent several days in Omaha recently making arrangements for the extensive horticultural exhibit which will be made by the various fruit raising sections of Colorado under her general supervision, and during her visit she took occasion to thoroughly investigate everything in connection with the exposition which had any bearing upon Colorado's participation in the affair.  She inspected the grounds and buildings thoroughly and before she left on a flying trip for the east was thoroughly posted on all the affairs of the exposition.  She declared in no uncertain manner that her state was neglecting its best opportunities and promised that she would stir the people when she returned.  How well she has kept her promise is shown by an interview with her which appeared in the Denver Republican on Monday of this week.  This interview was as follows:</p>
                            <p>"If Colorado neglects the opportunity to exhibit her varied resources at Omaha if will be to its lasting disgrace," said Martha A. Shute, secretary of the State Horticultural society, who returned from a visit to the site of the Transmississippi and International Exposition yesterday morning.  Mrs. Shute is a member of the state commission, and it is due almost entirely to her earnest effort that the proposed horticultural exhibit is in such excellent condition.</p>
                            <p>"We have engaged and paid for 1,898 square feet of space in the Horticultural building," said Mrs. Shute.  "A square foot of space for every year on the calendar.  The Arkansas valley and the western slope are almost entirely responsible for the success of my visit to Omaha.  Without the assistance of J. E. Gedding and George Swink of Rocky Ford and John S. Charlton of Mesa county the horticultural interests of this state would not have had as creditable a display as we are now assured of.</p>
                            <p>"I have seen nothing in print which adequately describes the grandeur and magnificence of this proposed exposition.  It is on a scale of such magnitude that it must be seen to be appreciated.  The buildings are simply enormous and they compare favorably with the structures at Chicago.  Of course they have no forty-acre buildings at Omaha, but all the others are fully as well adapted to the needs as were the World's fair exhibit houses.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">COLORADO'S GOOD CHANCES.</head>
                            <p>"The people of Omaha have been careful of Colorado interests and have been so in the face of almost criminal apathy on the part of the people of the Centennial state.  The spaces reserved some months ago in the Mining, Agricultural and Liberal Arts buildings are still being held for Colorado and are being withheld from other states of far less importance, yet anxious to fittingly display to the world their lesser, yet varied resources.</p>
                            <p>"I am more directly interested in horticulture, but I would be a poor citizen of the state if I did not feel indignant at the laziness of the people of Colorado.  New Mexico has engaged and paid for 2,000 feet of space in the Mining building alone.  Colorado, with a much more choice location, has not engaged or paid for a single foot, and I want any one who knows to just pause for a moment and compare the wealth of these two commonwealths.</p>
                            <p>"I am sure if our citizens could hear the comments I have heard they would feel surprised at their state taking so little interest in the exposition.  The other mining states are preparing to steal our thunder and are making every effort to put us in the shade.  I sometimes wonder what has become of our boasted loyalty to our state.  I think the governor was right when he said our greatest loss during the panic was our 'loss of courage.'  I am sure if Mr. Lee, our mining commissioner, would go to Omaha and stay but one day he would be as appreciative of the necessity of making a mining display as I am, and as other commissioners are.</p>
                            <p>"Just let me say here that I think the Agricultural department has less excuse than Mr. Lee's department has, for Lieutenant Governor Brush was at Omaha and was the most enthusiastic man there.  He said that he would or could almost guarantee an agricultural exhibit, and he said, in addition, that Colorado agricultural resources were equaled by but few states and excelled by none.  The exposition directors at Omaha frequently asked me what he become of Lieutenant Governor Brush's enthusiasm.  I told them he had it yet&#8212;in Greeley.</p>
                            <p>"Mrs. Mary Holland Kinkaid is taking a great interest in the educational department exhibit and her many friends in Omaha feel assured of a splendid display through her efforts.  Mrs. Thayer is also doing splendidly with her fine art display.  She has secured 400 feet of space in the liberal arts department and has the best space in the building.</p>
                            <p>"Regarding an exhibit from the State Agricultural college Hon. Alston Ellis asked me, before I left for Omaha, to ascertain what desirable space could be selected for the college exhibit.  I have that information for him and I am sure that college will be represented.</p>
                            <p>"I am assured by the chief of the Horticultural and Agricultural departments that arrangements have been made with the Burlington &amp; Missouri railroad that all exhibits will be forwarded to Omaha free of charge by fast freight.  Arrangements for cold storage in Omaha will be perfected in a few days.  The states represented in the Horticultural building are Illinois, Montana, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, California, Arkansas, Missouri and Colorado, and you mark my word, the last will not be the least in this galaxy.</p>
                            <p>"Of the thirty-five states to have exhibits at Omaha only about half a dozen have been assisted by legislative appropriations, so you see Colorado is in no worse condition than a couple of dozen energetic states."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Vice President Peavey Writes Encouragingly of the Outlook.</head>
                            <p>Vice President F. H. Peavey of Minneapolis writes to the Department of Publicity and Promotion that the affairs of the Minnesota commission are in excellent condition.  He says the commission started out with the avowed intention of raising $25,000 and $20,000 is now in sight with a very good prospect of raising the other $5,000.  Every county in the state has been asked to subscribe and Mr. Peavey says the counties are responding generously.  It is the intention to ask the legislature to reimburse subscribers to the fund for a state exhibit and this operates as a strong inducement to all sections of the state to have each section well represented.</p>
                            <p>Plans for a state building have been completed and the state will have extensive and excellent exhibits of the agricultural, horticultural and mineral resources.  The commission is receiving hearty support and co-operation from the Beekeepers' association of the state, the State Dairy commission and the State Dairymen's association, as well as from the live stock interests.  A fine showing is promised of the flax industry of the state as well as the wool industry.  In fact, Vice President Peavey says that matters in Minnesota, from an exposition standpoint, are in most promising condition and a fine exhibit and large attendance is assured beyond any doubt.</p>

                            <p>A. T. Macdonald of Denver, secretary of the Colorado Exposition and Denver commission, writes to the Department of Publicity and Promotion that exposition matters are in a more promising condition in that state at this time then they have been since the movement for a state exhibit was first started.  The last meeting of the state commission, he says, was most satisfactory, and the prospects for a first-class exhibit in mining, agriculture, fine art and education are very good.  It is said that Mining Commissioner Lee has "taken off his coat" and promises a good mineral exhibit and other departments are taking renewed interest, with the prospect of a fine exhibit in all lines.</p>
                            <p>The Denver building project is also said to be in promising condition and its erection is said to be assured.</p>

                            <p>The exhibit of the United States Fish commission is the first complete exhibit to reach the exposition grounds.  All the material for this display is now in the Government building, and the work of installation will be

                            commenced shortly.  There were three carloads of this material, this amount being in addition to the machinery, tanks, etc., which were received several week <choice><sic>ako</sic><corr>ago</corr></choice>.  The salt water for the ocean fish has not yet been received nor have any of the live fish arrived.</p>
                            <p>The construction of the elaborate tunnel for the live fish exhibit is proceeding under the direction of Mr. Schneider, representative of the Fish commission, and this will be completed within a few days.  The exhibit proper will be unpacked when the decorators shall have finished their work and will be put in position in short order.</p>
                            <p>Owing to a slight misunderstanding regarding stand pipes in the Government building for fire protection, water has not yet been turned into the fish tanks, but it is expected that the matter will be adjusted at once and water will be turned on and the tanks filled in order to disclose any leaks.</p>
                            <p>Nearly all of the government exhibits are now on the road and one or two cars of material are received nearly every day.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the building will be completed within twenty-four hours and the decorators are ready to commence work covering the interior with burlap.  The carload of burlap is somewhere in the Omaha railroad yards, but the authorities have not been able to locate it, although search has been made for several days.</p>
                            <p>A heavy platform is being constructed from the south door of the Government building to the railroad track on the south side of the main court, to be used in unloading the heavy ordnance and other weighty exhibits which belong in the Government building.</p>

                            <p>Tomorrow the county commissioners expect to select their space in the Horticultural building, wherein they will make the Douglas county floral display.  The commissioners wanted to get into the east wing of the building, opposite the point where the Nebraska exhibit will be located, but they were too late, the space having been taken.  Instead of getting this, they have been given the choice of two locations, both of which are considered superior in many respects.  One of the locations that the commissioners have under consideration is on the north side of the building, just to the west of the space under the dome and along the main aisle, running for east to west.  The other is just across the aisle to the south.</p>
                            <p>The horticultural exhibit is being worked up under the direction of Superintendent Hess, an experienced florist, and in addition to the unique designs that he proposes to show, he will have a large and varied collection of native and tropical flowering plants.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Agitation Among the Painters Continues, but Loses the Support of the Woodworkers&#8212;President Bell Investigates.</head>
                            <p>It has been decided by Carpenters' and Joiners' union, No. 427, not to support the agitation for a strike among the painters and decorators working at the exposition grounds.  This decision was reached at a meeting of the union last night, and the attitude of the carpenters and joiners is clearly defined by William Turner, their walking delegate, who has made a statement to The Bee regarding the controversy.</p>
                            <p>"Our union does not feel that labor is being imposed upon by the contractors at the grounds in the matter of wages.  We are willing to accept an increased scale, if it should be tendered to use, but as an organization we cannot see our way clear to agitate a strike looking to an enforcement of demands which some of the labor leaders are championing in the cause of the painters.  We think the contractors are doing well by labor, and for that reason they ought not to be compelled to fight a strike.  My impression is that there are only a few painters at the bottom of this agitation.  They have the backing of a number of labor leaders, but even in their own organization there is apparently such strong opposition to their strike movement that I do not think it will ever materialize."</p>
                            <p>President W. H. Bell of the Central Labor union went out to the exposition grounds early this morning and passed the day in a personal investigation of the painters' alleged grievances.  He has positively declared that he would talk no more about the trouble until some definite conclusion was arrived at and a policy formulated.</p>

                            <p>W. D. Mathews of Little Rock, secretary of the Arkansas Exposition commission, is in the city for the purpose of getting the work started on the Arkansas building.  The contract for this building was let recently to Haines &amp; Willetts of Stuttgart, Ark., and a member of the firm is in the city ready to commence operations.</p>
                            <p>"The Arkansas building will constructed of lumber donated by the lumber firms of our state," said Secretary Mathews, "and it will be a handsome structure.  The building will be a fac simile of the Albert Pike mansion in Little Rock, one of the finest examples of the colonial style of architecture in the country.  The building will be two stories in height with a wide portico across the front, the massive columns extending the full height of the house.  The outside will be of staff and will be painted to resemble brick, of which the original is built.  The interior will be finished throughout in native woods and this material is already collected.  The contractor is here now and will commence work at once.</p>
                            <p>"Exposition matters in our state are in excellent condition," continued Mr. Mathews.  "I have been devoting all my time to it and have been given every possible assistance by our newspapers.  The columns of all of our papers have been open for exposition news at all times and the people of the state have been kept well informed regarding the matter.  We have secured $2,500 from the railroads and hope to get more from some of the roads which have not yet given anything; we have been selling buttons to help raise funds for our building and exhibit and have raised enough money to make sure of having a display which will astonish the people who are not familiar with our state.</p>
                            <p>"I tell our people that we have the richest poor state and the poorest rich state in the union, and that statement describes the conditions that exist there.  We are rich in undeveloped resources, and this exposition will afford us a most excellent opportunity to show the world what our state is capable of doing.  We will make a showing in agriculture, horticulture, minerals, building stone, timber, etc., that will be a marvel.  Our preparations are about completed and our people will be here in force."</p>

                            <head type="sub">BENT ON FIGHTING DOUGLAS COUNTY</head>
                            <head type="sub">Ex-Member of the Exposition Commission Threatens to Replevin a Collection Unless His Demand for Money is Met.</head>
                            <p>It has become apparent that by discharging J. H. Taylor from his position on the Douglas County Exposition commission, the county commissioners laid the foundation for a lawsuit.  Taylor is willing to quit, but he wants the grains and grasses that he turned over to the committee and for the purpose of securing them, he has hired an attorney who will bring a replevin suit, unless the difficulties are adjusted outside of the courts, which hardly seems probable at this time, as the county commissioners contend that they have nothing to arbitrate.</p>
                            <p>Some days ago Taylor was appointed to <choice><sic>asist</sic><corr>assist</corr></choice> in the work of collecting a Douglas county agricultural exhibit for the exposition.  At a subsequent meeting of the Board of County Commissioners, Mr. Taylor was dropped from the pay roll, but not until after he had been paid some $250 for his services and for material that he had on hand.</p>
                            <p>Last fall after the close of the State fair, the exhibits from the several precincts of Douglas county were turned over to Taylor for safe keeping.  Some time ago when the county commissioners first talked of making an agricultural exhibit at the exposition, they discovered that the exhibit made at the last state fair was in Taylor's custody and that he would not let it go unless he was given a position with the exposition.  The position was given and Taylor was appointed, after which he turned over the property.  Afterward, the commissioners discovered that Taylor was a misfit in the position to which he had been appointed and he was removed, but not until after he had been paid for all of that portion of the exhibit the belonged to him.</p>
                            <p>If Taylor institutes legal proceedings, the county commissioners will fight the action to a finish, as they contend that if he ever had any claim upon the property, he surrendered it and received cash in full payment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Chairman Ben Hoffman Here to Make the Preliminary Arrangements for the Accommodation of Hundreds of Delegates.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Plans for the first convention that will be held during the Transmississippi and International Exposition are about complete.  This convention is that of the Traveling Men's Protective Association of North America.  It convenes on May 31 and continues until and including June 3.  It is a national gathering and is likely to be attended by several hundred delegates and a large number of persons who will accompany those who are entitled to seats in the convention.</p>
                            <p>Ben T. Hoffman of Lafayette, Ind., chairman of the hotel committee of the association, is in the city making arrangements for the accommodation of the national officers.  He has selected the Millard as the headquarters, but the members will be distributed among the other hotels, as no one hostelry

                            is large enough to accommodate the delegates and those who will come with them.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the convention of the traveling men Mr. Hoffman said:  "Everything indicates that this is going to be the greatest meeting that we have ever held.  We have 323 accredited delegates and I have advices assuring me that they will all be in attendance if they are alive and well.  Most of the married men will bring their wives, which ought to swell the attendance very materially.  In addition to this there will be wholesalers, supply men and many others, so that it is safe to say that the convention will bring 2,000 strangers to Omaha.  At our convention held at Terre Haute, Ind., the attendance was 700, while at San Antonio, Tex., it was 1,200.  Omaha is much more central than the Texas town and as the exposition is another attraction, I feel safe in predicting that the attendance will not fall short of 2,000, while it may be double this number.</p>
                            <p>"The national officers are all bending every effort to make this the great convention in the history of our association and <choice><sic>ia</sic><corr>it</corr></choice> now looks as though it will succeed far beyond their expectations.  We are pretty good men for a town, as we spend money liberally.  While we are not spendthrifts we set  hot pace and one that it may be well for other conventions to imitate.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska branch of the association is doing everything possible in the way of putting up an interesting program for their guests.  All of the meetings will be held in Creighton hall, that is the business meetings and such affairs as dances.  The social functions, however, will be held at the Transmississippi Traveling Men's club house, Sixteenth and Harney streets.  This large and roomy residence has been newly fitted.  New carpets have been laid, couches have been placed and a well appointed buffet has been established.  While not in convention or upon the streets or exposition grounds, the delegates will be expected to spend most of their time at these rooms, where they will have the keys to all of the lockers, which it is promised will contain the best that the county affords.</p>

                            <p>While the program of entertainment is not complete, it is pretty well along.  The opening meeting of the convention will be held at Boyd's theater on Tuesday, May 31, at 10 o'clock a. m.  This meeting will be opened with prayer by Rev. T. J. Mackay, rector of All Saints' Episcopal church, followed by an address of welcome by Mayor Moores, who will deliver the keys to the city.  The response will be by President Joseph Wallerstein of Richmond, Va.  This will be followed by an address by Governor Holcomb, who will welcome the delegates to the state of Nebraska, to which Jerry Porter of Kentucky will respond.  The address in behalf of the traveling men of the transmississippi region will be delivered by Rev. S. Wright Butler of St. Mary's Avenue Congregational church and to this Rev. Homer T. Wilson of Texas, chaplain of the association, will respond.</p>
                            <p>Tuesday evening the delegates and their male friends will be initiated into the mysteries of the court of King Ak-Sar-Ben.</p>
                            <p>On Wednesday the delegates will devote their time to the transaction of routine business, but during the evening there will be the relaxation and they will attend a reception at the local club rooms, which will be followed by a ball at Creighton hall.</p>
                            <p>Some time during the convention the wives of the traveling men and the women of the city will give their female guests a trolley ride over the lines of the Omaha Street Railway company.  The date of this function has not been fixed, as this and the completion of the program is in the hands of the local committee and has not been decided upon.</p>

                            <p>While here Chairman Hoffman is the guest of the local association of traveling men and is being well provided for.  He has advised that immediate steps be taken to secure the signatures of all of the traveling men of Nebraska and it is thought that before the middle of next month all of them will be enrolled as members of the national association.</p>
                            <p>At the present time the headquarters of the Nebraska branch of the Traveling Men's Protective Association of North America are located at Lincoln, but next month they will be removed to this city and will remain here during the continuance of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">County Superintendent Arranging for the Big Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>The county commissioners and R. S. Berlin, recently appointed superintendent of the Douglas county exhibit in the Agricultural building of the exposition, spent most of the day at the grounds, looking over the building and consulting over the matter of placing the county exhibit.  While Berlin's services are not supposed to begin until May 1, he is hard at work in preparing plans for the Douglas county exhibit and organizing his forces for the work that will be under his direction.</p>
                            <p>Discussing the proposed exhibit of Douglas county Mr. Berlin said:  "While we have not formulated our plans, we are certain of having the best county exhibit on the grounds.  The farmers of the county are taking hold of the matter and promises to furnish us much valuable assistance.  On the start we cannot expect to make much of a showing in the way of fruits and green vegetables, though we will have considerable in this line, as there is a fair quantity and a respectable variety kept over from last year, all of which is in cold storage.  By the time this is no longer fit for exhibition purposes, the crop will be matured and then we will put in an exhibit that will open the eyes of the visitors.</p>
                            <p>"Regarding grains and grasses, right from the start we will make a great showing.  We have a good stock left over from last year's exhibit at the State fair and this will be shown and kept in place until the new supply is ready.  On the whole Douglas county is going to make a great exhibit."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Government Exhibits Coming in Rapidly Just at Present.</head>
                            <p>Matters are beginning to assume a very lively air about the Government building as shipments continue to arrive with materials for the different exhibits which are to be installed in the big building.  Captain H. C. Ward, who has charge of the building, will take up his headquarters in one of the offices in the building the latter part of the week in order to be on hand all the time.  At present the many shipments require the attention of one man all the time and Mr. Ludwig Boege has been appointed transfer agent for the purpose.  Quartermaster Sergeant J. J. Hittinger, who is on duty in Captain Ward's office, is at the ground each morning to assist in looking after the exhibits, but in a few days these shipments has been let to the Omaha Merchants' Express company and a number of men and teams are already engaged in transferring the materials from the cars to the building.  Some of the shipments are in less than carlots and these are hauled from town in wagons.  The full cars are switched to the grounds and transferred to the building in the most convenient manner.</p>
                            <p>The carload of burlap which had been in the local railway yards for several days has been found and switched to the grounds.  The decorators will commence work at once putting the burlap covering on the interior walls of the building.  The installation of exhibits will follow close behind the decorators.</p>
                            <p>Bills of lading for a carload of medical supplies and full equipment for a field hospital have been received by Captain Ward.  These supplies have been shipped from the storehouse at St. Louis, and another lot of materials from the medical museum at Washington are also en route.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Work to Proceed on the Big Structure at Once.</head>
                            <p>The Council Bluffs Transmississippi association last night ended the long unsatisfactory effort that has been made to get a suitable and acceptable bid from contractors to erect the wigwam building.  It was summarily done by adoption of a resolution rejecting all bids and turning over to President Graham and some other intensely practical men the entire work and responsibility for the construction of the building.  The work of construction will be begun at once and the structure will be finished and ready for the installation of the exhibits within a month or six weeks.  The cost of the skeleton building was fixed at $3,000 and it is to be not less than sixty feet in diameter and as much larger as can be safely built.</p>
                            <p>Notice was received that the Iowa state commissioners would open an office in Council Bluffs within a few days and the association undertook to provide quarters for them in the Grand hotel.  It is probable that one of the rooms on the ground floor of the hotel will be set apart for their use as an office for the next two or three months.</p>
                            <p>The resolution which had been referred to George F. Wright at a previous meeting advising the solicitation of a contribution from the city council was called up and a committee consisting of Mr. Wright, President Graham, Lucius Wells, Victor Bender, E. A. Wickham, Dr. Barstow, George Carson, A. S. Hazelton, Colonel W. F. Baker and L. Leverett was appointed to wait upon the council at the meeting on Monday night and ask for a donation of $1,000, or less, to be appropriated from the water fund to defray the cost of plumbing and water privileges in the wigwam.</p>
                            <p>The secretary presented a list of 104 names of business men who had not been solicited to contribute to the building fund and from whom it was thought at least $1,000 could be secured.  The list was referred to Chairman Walters of the finance committee with instructions to have these men canvassed at once.</p>

                            <p>Several small concessions were awarded by the executive committee at its meeting yesterday afternoon, Manager Reed being authorized to enter into contracts with the following parties for the concessions named:  W. S. King of Omaha, the right to sell badges and buttons on the grounds and in the buildings; Leon Mooser, a concession on the West Midway for a pavilion for the installation of a company of glass blowers with the privilege of selling the manufactured articles; Thomas Hoctor of South Omaha, the privilege of exhibiting trained and fancy dogs in a pavilion on the West Midway.</p>
                            <p>The Afro-American village concession was reorganized and the privilege was relet to Thomas Hoctor of South Omaha and J. P. Finley of Omaha, the name of the concession being changed to Old Virginia Plantation.  They will erect a regulation plantation, with cabins, cotton fields, etc., and will have amusements of all kinds peculiar to the negroes of the south.</p>
                            <p>Bids for the staff work in connection with the electric fountain in the Mirror were laid before the committee by Manager Kirkendall, as follows:  Alexander &amp; Son, $1,450; Smith &amp; Eastman, $625.  These bids do not include the colossal figure of Neptune, which will surmount the central column of the fountain, Mr. Kirkendall having heretofore been authorized to make a contract for this statue at a cost not exceeding $300.  The staff work on the fountain was awarded to Smith &amp; Eastman.</p>

                            <p>A new bird's-eye view of the exposition grounds, in colors, has been completed by E. J. Austen, the special artist who has made all of the official bird's-eye views of the grounds.  The new picture shows the exposition grounds from the same point of view as the first picture, but the state buildings are shown exactly as they will appear when completed and the arrangement of the north tract is shown just as it will appear on the opening day of the exposition.  When the first bird's-eye view was made many of these matters were not definitely settled and a number of changes have since been made, all of which are shown accurately on the latest picture.  The work is done in several colors and is extremely handsome, being architecturally accurate and true in every detail.  The picture will be reproduced in colors by the Department of Publicity and Promotion and will form a most effective advertisement of the exposition, as well as a most desirable memento.</p>

                            <p>Former Governor George W. Glick of Atchison, president of the Kansas Exposition commission, is in the city for the purpose of making final arrangements for the erection of the Kansas building and taking bids for its construction.  He brought the plans of the building and these have been approved by the architects-in-chief.  Local contractors will be asked to submit bids for the building at once and Governor Glick will endeavor to dispose of the matter before returning to Kansas.  The present visit is the governor's first since work was commenced on the exposition and he was greatly astonished and pleased at the sight which met his eye when he visited the grounds in company with Major Clarkson.</p>
                            <p>Governor Glick reports that exposition matters in Kansas are in most encouraging conditions.  The process of raising money in the various sections of the state is a slow one, but he says he has no doubt about the ultimate success of the movement.  The commission is pushing the work of collecting an exhibit and is proceeding as though the money was at hand.</p>
                            <p>The plan for the Kansas building brought by Governor Glick show a modest but attractive building.  The central feature is a two-story pavillion, surrounded by an arcade.</p>

                            <p>E. D. Johnson, superintendent of the Agricultural department of the Nebraska Exposition commission, has commenced work in the Agriculture building, preparing the booth for the Nebraska agricultural exhibit.  The space to be occupied by the Nebraska exhibit is at the northwest corner of the building in one of the four most conspicuous spots in the entire building.  The main aisle running north and south through the center of the building passes along the end of Nebraska's space and the long side of the exhibit abuts on the main aisle, running east and west through the center of the building.  Mr. Johnson and his assistants are straining every nerve to make the Nebraska exhibit the finest in the entire building and those in charge of the Douglas county exhibit, which is next north of the Nebraska exhibit, are making every effort to excel all the rest of the building, Nebraska included.  Both of these exhibits are in the hands of men of long experience and artistic taste in this work and the result is sure to be highly commendatory.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Laying of the Cornerstone of the Great Exposition Followed by a Transformation Almost Beyond Comprehension.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Arbor day is the anniversary of the beginning of active work on the exposition grounds.  Just one year ago the cornerstone of the Arch of States was laid with imposing ceremonies and the work of construction was formally inaugurated.  At that time no work has been done on the ground with the exception of putting up the high fence which now surrounds the entire grounds.  A portion of the fence was completed at that time, but the only other work which had been accomplished up to that time was on paper.  The grounds had been taken possession of just one month before and in the meantime the general plan of operations had been determined and the preliminary arrangements were being completed as fast as the importance and magnitude of the work would allow.</p>
                            <p>Military and civic societies, state and municipal dignitaries, exposition officials and private citizens joined in the ceremonies incident to the inauguration of an event fraught with such great importance to the people of the entire west.  The cornerstone was laid with due signs and ceremonies by the grand lodge of Freemasons of Nebraska and the great exposition was formally inaugurated.</p>
                            <p>When this event transpired the Kountze tract, now the main court, was a flat piece of ground, surrounded by a wire fence.  Nothing was grown on it except the wild grass and weeds.  The bluff tract was a bare piece of ground, on which a good crop or corn had been raised the previous year.  The north tract was another flat piece of ground devoted partly to cultivation.  About one-third of it was included in the fence of the old fair grounds, and on this were a number of old buildings, which had long outlived their usefulness.</p>
                            <p>The year which has passed since the mighty throng wended its way along Twentieth street to the point destined to be the main entrance to the grounds, has been a year of great change.  The three pieces of land constituting the exposition grounds have been transformed as though by magic and a more beautiful spot it would be difficult to find.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">IN THE VAN OF ARCHITECTURE.</head>
                            <p>The Kountze tract is now known as the main court, and here is centered the architectural beauty of the exposition.  Every effect is produced by strict adherence to the dictates of the strictly classical.  Every building in this portion of the grounds is a magnificent illustration of classical architecture modified by a touch of the Renaissance sufficient to produce a result magnificent in elaborate decoration.  Grouped about a canal extending the full length of the tract and connected with covered colonnades giving the effect of false perspective, an architectural effect is attained, which has never been accomplished at any former exposition and places the Transmississippi and International Exposition at the front in the line of superiority in architecture.  Only the finishing touches are necessary to make this portion of the grounds complete.</p>
                            <p>The treatment of the bluff tract has been in strong contrast to that of the Kountze tract and the erstwhile cornfield has been transformed into the most beautiful parks within the limits of Omaha.  Huge trees have reared their lofty heads where formerly the tassels of the waving corn nodded in the breeze and winding walk covered with gravel have displaced the straight and narrow furrows made by the cultivator.  Numerous state building to be used as headquarters for the visitors from neighboring states have been erected or are in course of construction, and the beautiful Horticulture building stands in the middle of the tract as the center of attraction.  The upper portion of the tract is assigned to the amusement portion of the exposition and an army of workmen is engaged in pushing the construction of the numerous buildings which will be peopled by the natives of other climes, who will furnish amusement for those attending the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The treatment of the north tract, from an architectural standpoint, is radically different from that of the other two tracts, and here, too, great changes have been wrought in the appearance of the grounds.  This portion of the grounds is devoted to the display of agriculture and kindred industries and to transportation.  It is very appropriate, therefore, that the buildings should conform, architecturally, to the uses for which they are designed.  The style of architecture prevailing in the mountain districts of Switzerland has been adopted for these buildings, and an army of workmen is engaged in rearing the structures which will house the many exhibits which will be displayed here.  The huge building devoted to agricultural implements and transportation appliances will occupy the center of this part of the ground, and it is far advanced.  The Dairy and Apiary buildings are also in an advanced stage.  A good portion of this tract will be devoted to irrigation exhibits for which no buildings are required, and for this reason the west portion of this tract has undergone but little change.  The south part of this tract is devoted to a section of the Midway, and the erection of the many "villages" and pavilions makes this part of the grounds one of the busiest scenes in connection with the entire exposition.  Numerous substantial buildings have taken the place of the ramshackle structures which formerly occupied the grounds and the old race track has disappeared forever.</p>

This building is designed for the use of representatives of the press and will be fitted with the paraphernalia necessary for the successful conduct of the business of the occupants.  The building is 50x60 feet on the ground and forty feet in height.  The general style is Italian Renaissance of the Sixteenth century and the structure is a most attractive one.  The interior is arranged in a manner which will afford <choice><sic>execellent</sic><corr>excellent</corr></choice> accommodations for the people who are to use it.  The center will be a large room 31x35 feet in size, having a ceiling twenty-one feet in height.  The room will be thoroughly lighted by windows in the clear story.  On three sides of the room will be arranged small rooms, fourteen in number, each provided with tables, chairs, etc., and each having a door.  In these the representatives of the press of the country may work in quiet and peace.</p>
                            <p>A small room at each of the front corners of the building will be occupied by the two telegraph companies and dispatches may be sent direct from the building.</p>

McIntosh of Omaha, special commissioner of the wool section of the Department of Exhibits, is in correspondence with sheep growers and wool men in all sections of the west and with people in the east interested in the wool business.  He has received encouraging replies from the sheep raisers of the west and has assurances that a fine showing will be made in the wool section.  The Montana wool growers have taken an interest in the matter and it is the intention to erect the Devil's Tower, a noted peak in Wyoming, using wool as the material.  Other states are making preparations in the same direction and a good showing seems assured.</p>
                            <p>Mr. McIntosh has received a letter from A. W. Lightbourn, secretary of the Wool exchange, New York City, stating that the exchange will furnish a collection of standard types of wool on which quotations are based.</p>

                            <head type="sub">OPINION OF AN EXPERT ON THE MATTER</head>
                            <head type="sub">John Francis Believes the Attendance Will Be Large in Spite of the Interruption and Excitement Incident.</head>
                            <p>"What effect will the war have on the exposition?"  This is a question which is in the months of many people in this vicinity.  There are all shades and varieties of opinions on this matter, the <choice><sic>consensus</sic><corr>consensus</corr></choice> of opinion, among those who have given it little thought or who are not in position to judge intelligently, being that the effect will be bad and that the exposition will suffer from the general unrest attendant upon hostilities.</p>
                            <p>That this will not be the effect, however, may easily be seen by investigation of the conditions having a direct bearing upon this matter.  The fact that the Exhibits department is daily in receipt of large sums of money, representing the final payments of the space charge made by the numerous exhibitors, is proof positive that the exhibitors are coming.  For the last month these final payments have been coming in and there is no indication of any falling off in numbers.  Each mail brings several thousand dollars in payment for space and it goes without saying that no exhibitor will pay for his space without occupying it.  All of the available space in each building is taken and telegraphic applications from firms which delayed action are received every day.  Bills of lading received by the Transportation department are prima facie evidence that thousands of dollars worth of exhibits are enroute to Omaha from all the points of the compass.  These conditions assure an exposition and the only remaining factor in the success of the enterprise is the attendance.</p>
                            <p>People who have given this feature of the situation attention are all of the same opinion and all believe that the war will have no appreciable effect upon the attendance.  The closest observers of such matters are railway men, as the very nature of their business leads them to study the conditions which govern the movements of people under all circumstances.  John Francis, general passenger agent of the B. &amp; M. railroad, has been studying this phase of the situation during the stirring events of the last few weeks and he expresses the conviction that the exposition will not suffer in the slightest degree from this effect of the war.</p>
                            <p>"The great bulk of the attendance at the exposition," said Mr. Francis, "will come from within a radius of 350 miles from Omaha and with good <choice><sic>crcops</sic><corr>crops</corr></choice> and good business conditions these people will come to the exposition regardless of the war.  So far as the attendance from the east is concerned I believe it will be even larger with war than without it.  Under ordinary conditions there is heavy travel to Europe from this county every summer, but with the danger to travel incident to open hostilities, these people will undoubtedly forego their usual European trip and will cast about for some place to spend their summer outing.  I have already taken steps to endeavor to corral a good part of this class of travel.  I have taken up the matter with the eastern trunk lines, and an effort will be made to turn this travel westward to the mountains and the Pacific coast.  We will endeavor to route this travel via Omaha, and will arrange stopover privileges for the tourists, so that they may spend several days in Omaha and visit the exposition.  Nothing will be left undone to accomplish this result and I believe that in this way a large class of people will visit the exposition who would not think of coming west under ordinary conditions and the exposition will be correspondingly benefited."</p>

                            <head type="sub">ILLUMINATING THE COURT HOUSE.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Superintendent Houck Talks About the Fall Decorations.</head>
                            <p>The county commissioners are considering the question of illuminating and decorating the court house during the exposition.  While they have not adopted any plan, they have several that are partially formulated.</p>
                            <p>During the Ak-Sar-Ben festivities of last year and the year before, the commissioners decorated the court house and did something in the way of illuminating, but they were never entirely satisfied with the effect produced, although they felt upon both occasions that the county building was the most attractive in the city and that it was the most admired, not only by strangers, but by residents.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Houck of the court house has been requested to furnish and submit to the Board of County Commissioners a plan for decorating and illuminating.  In speaking of the matter, he said:  "The county building occupying a prominent position upon one of the main streets of the city can be made most attractive if money is appropriated to pay for doing the work.  Last year we had some special electrical illuminations in the way of a flag, a shield and a star.  They were very pretty, but I don't think that they quite filled the bill.  If the county commissioners decide to illuminate this year and if they leave the preparation of the designs to me, I think I can work out something that will be attractive and at the same time not so very expensive.  The court house is well adapted for making a magnificent display in an electrical way.  For instance, take the north side of the building.  We could work a farm or hunting scene in under the coping and have a fine effect.  It could be a painting if necessary.  This would show off to good advantage during the daytime and if illuminated, it would be very attractive at night.  On the east and west sides of the building, up under the battlement, I think that we should have some figures.  They are not expensive and if properly placed, they would add much to the general appearance of the building.</p>
                            <p>"Last year we placed a torch in the hand of the figure of Justice that surmounts the dome.  That was satisfactory and could not be improved upon, but the dressing of this figure could be materially improved upon.  Instead of having rows of incandescent lights running down the folds of her dress I think that it would be a good plan to have powerful lights placed at each of the four corners of the pedestals upon which she stands.  This would not only bring out the figure, but at the same time it would light up the upper portion of the building.</p>
                            <p>"The flag decoration of last year was not up to my idea, but it was the best that could be done under the circumstances.  Those streamers extending from the dome to the four corners of the building gave the structure the appearance of a back yard on wash day when the colored clothes were out on the line to dry.  Stored away in the building we have the flags and pennants of all the civilized nations and if these were placed upon standards and grouped or arranged about the roof of the building I think that we could produce an effect of which we could be proud."</p>
                            <p>Whatever the commissioners do in the way of illuminating and decorating will be done very soon, as they have all expressed the opinion that if the court house is to be made attractive it should be done that it may put its best foot to the front on the opening day of the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Conference with Exposition Officers on the Exhibit Question.</head>
                            <p>A meeting of prominent stockmen from Missouri, Minnesota, Kansas, Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska was held last night for the purpose of discussing the exhibit of live stock at the exposition.  The meeting was addressed by President Wattles and Edward Rosewater on behalf of the exposition management, and a general discussion was had of matters of interest to prospective exhibitors of live stock and breeders of show stock.  The chief question under discussion was what kind of prizes should be offered.  The exposition directors decided some time ago that medals would be better than cash prizes to offer to exhibitors, but it seems to be the opinion of the stockmen that money prizes would be more desirable and more apt to insure a fine display of live stock.  It is the intention of the directors to arrange this matter in a manner satisfactory to prospective exhibitors.</p>
                            <p>Among the prominent stock raisers at the meeting were:  Martin Flynn, G. E. Ward, J. E. Sherman, L. Brodsky, C. M. Lambing, Ben Nichols, Iowa; H. F. Brown, Minnesota; F. Bellons, George Bellons, Missouri; H. M. Wilson, Illinois; ex-Governor G. W. Glick, Kansas; F. M. Woods, ex-Governor Furnas, Nebraska.</p>

The election of vice presidents and members of the executive committee was deferred till a time when a full list of persons who are eligible to the club can be compiled, in order that the officers selected may be as representative as possible.  It is the aim of the club to advertise the exposition extensively by sending circulars to England and Canada, and no effort will be spared to enlist every eligible person in Omaha in the work.  Another meeting will be held next Friday night at the same place.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Says Thirty Tons of Choice Specimens Have Been Prepared and Will Be Brought Here for Display.</head>
                            <p>W. H. Sutherlin, vice president for Montana, is in the city and intends to remain here until after the close of the exposition.  He will assume personal charge of the Montana exhibits which have arrived or are enroute and will superintend the installation in the exposition buildings.  His family will arrive early in the coming week.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sutherlin says the mineral exhibit of Montana will consist of thirty tons of all the various kinds of minerals found in the state.  Reports from Montana are to the effect that the collection includes some unusually fine specimens, but Mr. Sutherlin is very modest in claiming superiority for the exhibit collected under his direction and merely says that he believes the exhibit will be a good one.  Twenty tons of these minerals are now in the city and the remaining ten tons are on the way.  A large supply of agricultural exhibits is also in the city.  These materials are in the cars in the railway yards and have not yet been switched to the exposition grounds.  As soon as the floor spaces in the Agricultural and Mines buildings are marked out these cars will be switched to the grounds and unloaded and the work of installation will commence at once.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sutherlin says his state will have a good exhibit in horticulture, forestry and education.  These have not yet been <choice><sic>shlpped</sic><corr>shipped</corr></choice>, but arrangements have been completed for all of these and the materials will be shipped within a short time.</p>

                            <p>The beautiful building in which will be displayed the exhibits of the government at the Transmississippi and International Exposition is about completed and a few days will see the magnificent structure turned over to the representatives of the various governmental departments who will install within its walls the extensive exhibits designed to illustrate the functions of the government.</p>
                            <p>This building is conceded to be the handsomest on the grounds and no pains seem to have been spared to make it magnificent in every detail.  It is larger in every way than any of the other beautiful structures in this portion of the ground.  Occupying the place of honor at the west end of the main court; facing the broad Mirror, the lagoon and the grand court formed by the main buildings of the exposition, the Government building is the most conspicuous object on the grounds.  The architecture is Italian Renaissance in style and of the Corinthian order.  The embellishment is massive and elaborate, every detail being carefully worked out.  From the broad steps leading to the interior to the crown surmounting the colossal figure of "Liberty Enlightening the World," which overlooks the city from its lofty pinnacle 176 feet above the ground, the work is as carefully done as though the building was intended to stand for hundreds of years instead of being merely a temporary covering for the exhibits of the government.</p>
                            <p>The building is covered with staff, no plaster being used, even on the plain surfaces.  On the contrary the latter are covered with great slabs of the white, marble-like staff, carefully fitted together and "pointed" and the ornamental portions are of <unclear reason="torn"/> the entire building hav-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Messrs. Alexander &amp; Son, the staff contractors, are putting the finishing touches on the building by installing the huge groups of statuary which surmount the square pavilions are either side of the main entrance.  The contract for the building requires it to be completed by May 1, but it will have been finished and turned over to the government fully a week before that time.</p>
                            <p>The building is already the center of admiration, all visitors to the grounds remarking upon its great beauty and substantial appearance, and the dazzling whiteness of <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> walls.  Attaches of the various governmental departments connected with the exhibits to be made in the building, declare most positively that at no previous exposition has the government erected a building so artistic and beautiful.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Chairman Nind and Architect MacLeod Come to Construct It.</head>
                            <p>J. Newton Nind, chairman of the building committee of the Minnesota Exposition commission, and James Allan MacLeod, architect of the Minnesota building, are in the city with the plans of the building and will take bids from the local contractors for its construction.  They will be in the city several days and will endeavor to make a contract for the erection of the building before leaving.</p>
                            <p>The Minnesota building will be one of the most attractive on the bluff tract.  Its architecture will be on the order of a Swiss chalet, the exterior being constructed of rough logs.  The building will be two stories in height and will be surrounded by side porches and balconies.  The interior will be finished in native woods, showing the varieties which flourish in Minnesota..  The main hall will be finished in the fashion of a modern club, oak being used for the decoration.  The room <choice><sic>asigned</sic><corr>assigned</corr></choice> to the men will be finished in the style typical of a lumber camp, split puncheons being used for the floors and the walls being rough.  The room for the women will be in strong contrast with the men's room, being as light and dainty in appearance as it can be made.</p>
                            <p>The building will be 35x80 feet, exclusive of the porches.  The logs and other material required in the construction of the building have been donated by the lumbermen of Minnesota and the material is ready to ship.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Omaha Chorus Prepares Plans for Its Appearance.</head>
                            <p>The arrangements for the participation by the Omaha chorus in the musical program of the exposition have been partially completed and the chorus was notified at the last rehearsal of what may be expected to begin with.</p>
                            <p>The chorus will make its bow before the public on the evening of June 2, when it will sing an opening ode written for the occasion by a member of the staff of a Chicago newspaper, with music by an American composer.  June 6 the chorus will sing the "Daughter of Jairus," by Stainer; June 14 it will appear in an orchestral concert and will sing "Fair Ellen," by Bruch; June 20 the "Easter Hymn" from Cavalleria Rusticana will be rendered and June 27 "Rose Maiden" will be the bill.</p>
                            <p>With the exception of the opening ode the selections referred to are all in rehearsal.  In addition to these the chorus will also be drilled on a number of other selections and will be in condition to respond to any reasonable demands.</p>
                            <p>At the last rehearsal the chorus took up, "Fair Ellen," and two choruses were gone over with a degree of success that was pronounced very satisfactory by Conductor Kelly.  One or two choruses from the "Rose Maiden" were also taken up and the finals of the "Daughter of Jairus" and the "Easter Hymn" were reviewed.</p>
                            <p>The chorus is short of altos and a few good voices will be accepted at once by Conductor Kelly.</p>
                            <p>Director Kimball has appointed Jonathan Mellen secretary of the Omaha chorus and he will attend to the business details of the work, leaving Mr. Kelly free to attend to the musical features of the work.  This will facilitate rehearsals, as a considerable portion of Mr. Kelly's time at each rehearsal has been taken up by consultations with members regarding details of business which will now be attended to by Mr. Mellen.</p>
                            <p>Musical Director Kimball states that arrangements are about completed with the Minneapolis chorus to visit the exposition and sing Director Willard Patten's composition, "Isaiah."  A few minor details remain to be arranged in connection with transportation and Mr. Kimball says these will be disposed of with little difficulty.  The chorus will sing in the Auditorium the afternoon of June 29.</p>
                            <p>Mr. <choice><sic>Kmball</sic><corr>Kimball</corr></choice> says he is in correspondence with musical organizations at Dubuque, Salt Lake City, Milwaukee and other points.  It is proposed to bring to Omaha the famous Tabernacle choir of Salt Lake City and arrangements looking to that end are in progress.  The Milwaukee Lyric Male club is also negotiating for a trip to Omaha and indications are flattering that a number of excellence organizations will occupy the Auditorium stage during the summer.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Machinery Found to Be in Good Working Order.</head>
                            <p>A portion of the machinery in the Power building was started up yesterday for the purpose of trying the mechanism, and also to secure a current of electricity with which to test the arc lamps which will be used on the exposition grounds.  A Westinghouse engine of 330 horse power and a 125-arc dynamo were the machines used, being connected by a belt.  One of the small boilers of the plant furnished the steam and everything worked very smoothly.  This machinery will be used frequently for the testing of the arc lamps, there being a large number to be tested before they are ready for use.</p>
                            <p>There are now in place in the Power building the battery of six boilers which will furnish the steam for the engines.  Four of these boilers are of 600 horse power and the other two are of 300 horse power each, making the combined horse power 3,000.  The engines and dynamos which will furnish the power for the entire grounds are not all at hand.  There are now installed two Westinghouse engines, one engine supplied by the Buffalo Forge company, four 125-arc dynamos and one power dynamo of 360 horse power furnished by the General Electric company.  Several other dynamos and engines will be installed in the building as soon as they arrive.  These are now en route to Omaha and are expected to arrive within a few days.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Rustin of the Bureau of Light and Power, says that the Power building will be ready for business not later than May 3 or 4.  The electric wiring is about completed and little remains to be done aside from installing the machinery yet to arrive and placing the arc and incandescent lamps.</p>

                            <p>Upon receipt of a petition signed by fifteen Omaha jobbers and traveling men the Travelers' Protective Association of America has granted a charter to an Omaha post of that association, to be called Post A of the Nebraska division.  A meeting of the members who are interested in this new post was held last night at the Traveling Men's Transmississippi club and an organization was perfected.  Clarence W. Close was elected president, J. L. Houston, vice president; R. F. Hodgin, secretary and treasurer, and the following board of directors was chosen:  E. B. Branch, M. W. Rayley, W. H. Butts, M. Meyer, M. Wulpi and O. C. Holmes.  Until a permanent place of meeting is provided for the post the meeting will be held at the Traveling Men's Transmississippi club house.</p>
                            <p>The meeting of the national association of the Travelers' Protective association is to be held in Omaha on May 31, June 1, 2 and 3.  The matter of entertaining the visitors who will be here at that time is being considered by the local members of the association and they hope to make the visiting members' stay in the city very pleasant.  On the afternoon of May 31 a welcome will be given the visitors in the morning at Boyd's theater.  In the afternoon the men of the party will hold a business meeting at the Creighton hall and the women will be taken for a trolley party by the wives of the local members.  In the evening the men will be entertained at the den of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben and the women will be entertained downtown.  No arrangements have been definitely made for the entertainment on Wednesday, June 1, but on Thursday night, June 2, the Traveling Men's Transmississippi club will entertain the guests at a reception and dancing party.</p>

The room at the front is assigned to the boys, and this will be fitted up with the things dearest to a boy's heart.  Exhibits of every description calculated to arrest the attention of Young America will be here and the room will probably be crowded the greater part of the time.  The large room on this side of the building will be devoted to exhibits of a miscellaneous character and the small room next east of it will be occupied by the kindergarten exhibit.</p>
                            <p>At the east side of the main room, opposite the entrance to the building, will be the creche, where babies will be checked and taken care of for a nominal fee, while their mothers are inspecting the exposition.  The original intention of having a sandpile at the back of the building on one side and a shallow pool on the other side, has been adhered to and these adjuncts to a "good time" from a childish standpoint will be at hand.  These accessories have been the subject of more talk on the part of juveniles who intend visiting the exposition than any other thing which has been suggested, and there has been no thought of breaking faith with the youngsters on this point.</p>
                            <p>The upper floor of the building will be occupied by a restaurant, which will be conducted along strict temperance lines.  The concession for this has not been let as yet, but several propositions are under consideration.</p>

                            <p>Speaking of the Douglas county exhibit at the exposition, Chairman Kierstead of the Board of County Commissioners said:  "It is surprising the amount of interest that the farmers of the county are taking in the big show.  Out in the rural districts the farmers are planting early crops of all kinds that they may mature and be ready to put on exhibition before the regular crop is ready to show.  In some places in the county farmers have planted corn and are coaxing it along in order to show just what can be done in this state.  The farmers will protect this corn from frost and if nothing happens to prevent, the crop will be in shape to exhibit not later than July 1.</p>
                            <p>"All over the county small patches of vegetables have been planted and in many instances they are up.  The facts are that for exposition purposes the farmers of this county are crowding the season and will push it about two weeks to a month earlier than it would be under ordinary conditions."</p>

In addition to this, it will show the lands under cultivation, together with the farm lands that are planted to corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye and sugar beets.

Prof. Eaton says he will be glad to figure in the program for June 29 or 30, and that his subject will be "The Commercial Instruction Needed in American Schools," or "The New Idea of Commercial Education."  As the question of commercial instruction at the High school is a very live issue in local educational circles Superintendent Pearse is much pleased to secure Prof. Eaton.  He is regarded as one of the leading authorities of the United States on the questions that he will discuss and his lecture is anticipated with exceptional interest by local educators.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXHIBITORS ARE INSTALLING DISPLAYS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Superintendent Hardt Finds His Work Already Bearing Fruit in the Structures  Around the Main Court.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The favorable weather of the last week contributed very materially to the progress of work on the exposition grounds and visitors who had not seen the grounds since the previous Sunday were astonished at the many changes which had been wrought in the week.  The transformation which has been going on for the last year is approaching consummation at a rapid rate and no doubt remains in the mind of the most pessimistic skeptic as to whether the exposition will be ready for the opening day.</p>
                            <p>The greatest intent on the part of visitors as well as on the part of the exposition authorities naturally centers in the main court, as it is here that the greatest transformation has taken place and the most beautiful results are being rapidly attained.  Busy workmen are to be seen on every side and under their deft hands the work is being rapidly completed.  With the exception of the Art building the main buildings are now practically finished and the work of installing exhibits is under way.  Minor details remain to be completed on two or three of the buildings, but these do not interfere in any way with the occupancy of the buildings by such exhibitors as wish to commence the erection of their booths.</p>
                            <p>The colonnades at the east end of the main court and the viaduct leading from the main court to the bluff tract are still under construction, but will be completed within the next two weeks.  The park colonnades between the Machinery and Manufactures building on the north side of the lagoon and between the Mines and Liberal Arts buildings on the south side are nearing completion.  The exterior of the Art building will be completed within the coming week and the interior of this building is now in the hands of the painters and decorators.  The Arch of States and the Girls' and Boys' building are still in the hands of the carpenters and both will be ready for the staff workers by the first of next week.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">PARKING AND PAVING.</head>
                            <p>The terraces in front of the Agricultural, Manufactures, Liberal Arts and Art buildings have been sodded and the rich green of the grass, contrasting with the dazzling white of the building, gives a faint hint of the beauty which will pervade the entire court when the work of the landscape gardener is completed.  The broad promenades at the top of the terraces, extending entirely around the lagoon is making rapid progress.  Gray brick is being used for paving around the Mirror.  The wide space in front of the Government building and the broad plaza extending entirely around the three-lobed Mirror have been paved and the workmen are engaged in paving along either side of the lagoon.  The walks through the covered colonnades have been macadamized.</p>
                            <p>Special efforts are being made to push work on the electric fountain in the Mirror and the contractor is employing a large force of men to finish the lower portion of the fountain so that the water may be turned into the lagoon.  The piers for the permanent bridges across the lagoon at Twentieth street and the "docking" about the lagoon have been completed and as soon as the base of the fountain is constructed the lagoon will be filled with water again.  It is expected that the water will be turned on Tuesday night.  With the large supply pipes now connected with the water mains, but a short time will be required to fill the big basin.</p>
                            <p>The marking of the floors of the main buildings has been commenced.  The spaces to be occupied by the exhibitors are outlined with broad white lines painted on the floor and each space is indicated by the number of the exhibitor.  Each exhibitor is supplied with shipping labels marked with his number and when his goods arrive they are unloaded at the building designated on the label and the goods deposited on the space corresponding with the number on the label.  This system was devised by Superintendent Hardy of the Exhibits department and all confusion is thereby avoided.  When a prospective exhibitor makes application for space his application is numbered in the order of its receipt and this exhibitor is henceforth, for all exposition purposes, known by his number, and it is this number which is marked on the space assigned to the exhibitor in the main building and which appears on the shipping labels.</p>

                            <p>The Agricultural building is in the possession of the Agricultural department of the Nebraska exposition.  A force of men under Superintendent Johnson is engaged in preparing the elaborate booth which will be fitted up with the extensive agricultural exhibit to be made by Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>In the Manufactures building J. H. Hussie, a local dealer in stoves and hardware, is the first to take possession of the space assigned to him and a force of carpenters is engaged in constructing a booth for his exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The Otto Gas Engine company is the first arrival in the Machinery and Electricity building, a gang of masons and laborers being engaged on a masonry foundation for one or more engines.</p>
                            <p>In the Mines building Montana is the first arrival and the outlines of the booth which is to house the mineral exhibit of the mountain state are making their appearance.</p>
                            <p>The preparation of the exhibits in the Government building has been under way for some time, the Fish commission representatives having been in possession of the northwest corner of the building for some time, but these are now augmented by representatives of the War, Postoffice and Treasury departments and the interior of the building is beginning to present a lively appearance.  Exhibits are piled everywhere in the middle of the floor, the object being to leave the walls clear so as not to interfere with the decorators, who now have full sway.</p>
                            <p>The decoration of the interior of the Government building is in the hands of J. B. Morey, a decorator of Washington, who performed the same service at all the recent expositions in which the government has participated.  The plan of decoration of the building is very simple, but very effective.  The walls are covered to a height of twelve feet with maroon colored burlap and above this point to the ceiling burlap of the natural color is used.  The result is an effect of red and old gold, which is striking.  The burlap is put on perfectly plain and a neat moulding covers the joining of the different colors.</p>
                            <p>The trusses which support the roof of the building will be hidden from view by festoons of drapery of red, green and old gold, with a stand of the national colors at the apex of each truss.  The great dome, which rises to a height of 150 feet above the floor, will be festooned with bunting and American flags, and the huge iron columns which support the dome will be painted dark red to a point twelve feet from the floor and bronzed from that point to the top.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Representative of President Dole Apprises the Exposition Officials of His Intention to Show Goods at Omaha.</head>
                            <p>The Republic of Hawaiian is the latest acquisition to the list of foreign governments which will officially participate in the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  This information was received by the Exhibits department in a letter from Robert W. Shingle.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shingle writes from Honolulu under date of April 12 and says that on the day before the letter was written President Dole had recommended to the legislature an appropriation of $5,000 for an exhibit of the Hawaiian Islands at the exposition.  Mr. Shingle adds that the legislature is still in session and the "bill will be passed within two weeks."  The calm assurance pervading his entire letter leads to the inference that Mr. Shingle has been given a "hunch."  This suspicion is supported by the statement that President Dole has notified Mr. Shingle that he is to be appointed general commissioner in full charge of the exhibit at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A brief outline of the nature of the exhibit discloses that it will be largely agricultural, coffee being the leading feature, including the various stages of growth, and the subsequent treatment.  There will also be included sugar cane, rice, taro and a full collection of island fruits tastefully arranged.  In addition to this display of the agricultural resources of the islands, Mr. Shingle says he will bring a fine collection of island woods and many other things of interest to the people of this country, including a large collection of antiques.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shingle asks that space be reserved for his exhibit in a desirable location and says he will leave the islands about the middle of May for Omaha with all his wares and people.</p>

                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee yesterday afternoon Manager Kirkendall announced the appointment of the commandant of the guards for the exposition grounds and buildings.  The appointee is C. E. Llewellyn, an Iowan who has been connected with the exposition as special agent for some time.  Mr. Llewellyn has had extended experience in military matters and was attached to the staff of the United States marshal of this district for several years about twenty years ago.  He will proceed to organize the guard within a short time and will take charge of the policing of the grounds.  Manager Kirkendall says the force will be limited to about 100 men during the early days of the exposition, and for these positions there are thousands of applications on file from all parts of the country.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles was authorized to entertain the visiting editors to be brought to Omaha by the Elkhorn road next Monday evening to remain until Tuesday evening.  The visitors will be entertained at dinner by the exposition officials and made to feel at home generally.</p>
                            <p>A number of bids for supplying ice to the exposition grounds and to the concessionaires, paying to the exposition a percentage on the receipts, were laid before the committee by Manager Reed of the Concessions department.  <choice><sic>Th</sic><corr>The</corr></choice> highest percentage was offered by A. T. Ayer of 4027 Seward street.  No one knew him and after some discussion Manager Reed was authorized to enter into a contract with the highest responsible bidder.  Investigation into the circumstances surrounding Ayer's bid led to the conclusion that he is employed by a local ice company which put in a bid to pay the exposition 12 per cent on sales.  Manager Reed will make a thorough investigation into the matter before making a contract with Ayer.</p>
                            <p>A concession was let to B. F. Mayer to put on the grounds fifteen to twenty-five automatic, recording, penny-in-the-slot scales, and to F. C. Whirley for four booths for the sale of cigars.</p>

                            <p>The members of the finance committee for the Transmississippi Educational congress have been hard at work during the last few days collecting the necessary funds to carry the enterprise through.  They report that their efforts have been more successful than they expected.  Nearly the entire amount necessary to conduct the congress is now in sight, and they state that their requests for donations were met with a liberality on the part of local business men that was exceptionally gratifying.  Notwithstanding the fact that no effort was made to collect the money at this time a large number of the donors insisted on paying cash, and about $600 was received.</p>
                            <p>The entire amount pledged, including what is expected from the school teachers, is $2,500, which is expected to be sufficient.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Wakefield Hopes to Get the Relic for Exhibition.</head>
                            <p>Steps are being taken by Secretary Wakefield to secure for the exposition what is claimed to be the original American flag of the stars and stripes pattern.  This old flag is now in the possession of Mrs. Samuel Bayard Stafford of Connecticut.</p>
                            <p>According to the story told of this ancient relic, it was made in Philadelphia by the Misses Mary and Sarah Austin and was hoisted by Captain John Paul Jones, the Ranger, in the fall of 1777.  The flag was shot from the masthead in an engagement and was rescued from the ocean by Lieutenant John Bayard Stafford, an ancestor the present owner, who jumped overboard before it sank and recovered it.  It was shortly afterward presented to him and has been in the Stafford family ever since.</p>
                            <p>The flag was originally fifteen feet long, but has been reduced to about nine feet by relic hunters.  It is made of English bunting sewed with flax thread and has thirteen stripes and twelve stars, there being four horizontal lines of three stars each, the reason alleged for this being that Georgia had not entered the union at the time when the flag was planned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Western States Preparing to Make a Wonderful Display of All Sorts of Minerals at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Dr. David T. Day, mining commissioner for the exposition, has returned from a trip through the northern mining states of the transmississippi region and reports that the arrangements for a comprehensive and excellent mineral exhibit are very complete.  In California he found that the community has been thoroughly aroused by Commissioner Richardson and complete arrangements are under way for a fine mineral exhibit.  Washington and Oregon are each trying to excel the other in the extent and excellence of their exhibits and both are <choice><sic>vieing</sic><corr>vying</corr></choice> with California to show an Alaska exhibit.  Dr. Day says that all three of these states will have exhibits of Alaska products and outfitting supplies of all kinds.  All do business with Alaska and the products of that far away territory pass through the ports of all three states, so that an extensive exhibit of Alaskan materials is assured.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Day visited Idaho and found all matters there is promising condition.  Utah was especially gratifying to the doctor, and he says that state is collecting the finest mineral exhibit that has ever been seen at an exposition.  The work is in charge of Don Maguire, an expert in minerals.  Dr. Day says that at the Atlanta exposition Maguire amazed everybody at the excellence of the exhibit and the great wealth of the state as shown by it.  At the coming exposition Dr. Day says Utah will eclipse all previous records, and will make a showing that will astonish the people.</p>
                            <p>When Dr. Day reached Wyoming he says he found the people inclined to let exposition matters go by default, but before he came away they had commenced packing their exhibit for shipment to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>In Colorado Dr. Day attended a meeting of the state commission held Monday night of this week and received assurances that the state will be represented in an excellent manner in everything except live stock.  Dr. Day attributes a very large share of the credit for this condition to the report made by Mrs. Martha Shute, the state commissioner, of horticulture, who recently visited Omaha.  Mrs. Shute stirred up the people in the most effective manner after her return, and, as a result, Dr. Day says he found that everybody is working with might and main to have the state represented in the best possible manner.  Mining Commissioner Lee assured Dr. Day that the Colorado mineral exhibit will be the best the state has ever made, and will include a collection of <choice><sic>crystalized</sic><corr>crystallized</corr></choice> gold, valued at from $30,000 to $40,000, which has never been shown before.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Day expresses the greatest satisfaction at the results of his flying trip, and says the mining exhibit of the exposition will be all that the most exacting could wish.</p>

                            <p>The regular meeting of the Nebraska Exposition commission last night was mainly devoted to signing vouchers and passing on bills incurred since the last meeting.</p>
                            <p>Commissioners Neville and Casper were appointed as a committee to investigate the advisability of tinting the exterior of the Nebraska building.</p>
                            <p>A proposition from Dr. Lang of York to bring the York Glee club to the exposition the opening day and furnish music for that occasion was accepted and the club will warble in the Nebraska building June 1, during the exercises incident to the formal opening of the great fair.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Youngers of the Horticulture bureau presented a basket of apples for the inspection of the members of the commission as a practical exposition of what may be expected in the horticultural section of the Nebraska exhibit.  These apples were of several varieties of winter apples and all had been in cold storage, some of them since October.  Without exception, the apples were as firm and hard as though just picked from the tree and their color and flavor were pronounced perfect.  The members of the commission expressed the greatest gratification at the manner in which the apples had been preserved and were highly pleased at the outlook for a fine showing at the opening of the exposition.  Mr. Youngers stated that he has sixty different varieties of apples in cold storage, all being the product of Nebraska orchards.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission spent the entire morning in executive session considering the claims of the staff and plaster contractors on the Nebraska building.  No conclusion was reached, but the committee appointed at the last meeting to investigate this matter was continued with power to act.  The difference between the contractors and the commission is not a large one, in dollars and cents.</p>

                            <p>It was decided to paint the exterior of the state building to conform to the color of the other buildings, a pale cream color which preserves the staff.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Casper announced the appointment of A. W. Shickley of Genevaas an employe in the Floriculture bureau, and Jerry Wagoner of Bellwood in the Agricultural bureau.</p>

                            <p>W. B.

Secretary Howell asked if Foo was the responsible party and if the Chinamen should be returned to their native land.</p>
                            <p>Following this telegram President Wattles received a wire from C. A. Souther, a ticket agent of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul railway in Chicago, to the effect that Foo had wired the collector at Port Townsend to admit the Chinamen.  The telegram also stated that the money in payment of the space on the exposition grounds would be sent to Omaha at once and <choice><sic>asekd</sic><corr>asked</corr></choice> President Wattles to notify the collector at Port Townsend that everything is all right and that the Chinamen should be admitted.</p>
                            <p>Although no reference was made to the <choice><sic>f act</sic><corr>f act</corr></choice> in any of this telegraphic correspondence, it is known that Foo is in <choice><sic>ajil</sic><corr>jail</corr></choice> in Chicago on account of an encounter with an attorney in a court room while court was in session, both Foo and the attorney being sent to jail for contempt of court.</p>
                            <p>No action whatever has been taken in the matter by the exposition authorities, and President Wattles says he will not become mixed up in the affair in any way, but will let the Chinese commissioner and his backers adjust their own troubles.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DECIDES FATE OF INDIAN CONGRESS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Some Good Work Done in the Right Way Will Assure This Feature for the Coming Bog Show at Omaha.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, April 27.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Senator Allison has notified the conferees on the Indian bill that a conference will be held tomorrow morning in the rooms of the senate committee on appropriations.  The difference between the houses so far as the bill goes is not so much a question of money as it is a legislative provision.  The house bill carried an appropriation of $7,517,454, while the senate bill carries $7,725,120, that being an appropriation of $45,000 for the Indian congress at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The house disagreed to this amendment and the conferees will accordingly have to pass upon the advisability of retaining this amendment in the bill.  It is believed that the members of the conference are in favor of the provision, but active work is needed on the part of the members of the delegation to cinch the matter.</p>
                            <p>John Jacob Astor, who has tendered a fully equipped battery to the president and has offered to take command of the same or take any position which may be assigned him, is at the Shoreman.  To The Bee representative he stated today that it was an ill wind that blows nobody good and out of the war Omaha would profit immensely, in his opinion.  Instead of a large tourist travel to Europe this year he thought people with money would for the first time explore the west and Omaha, with its international exposition, would benefit immeasurably from existing conditions.  He cited in support of his proposition that one of the large European steamers sailed today from New York with but eighty passengers, whereas at this time a year ago an ocean liner could not accommodate travel, passage being booked for days and weeks in advance.</p>
                            <p>Harry H. Brigham, son of Assistant Secretary Brigham of the Agricultural department, has been selected by the board of government control to represent the department at the Omaha Exposition and he leaves Saturday for his post.  He will be accompanied by Jasper A. Wilson, son of the secretary of agriculture, who will take a minor capacity under Mr. Brigham.  Wilson leaves tomorrow to make a short visit at Ames, Ia., before entering upon his duties at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>William V. Cox, secretary of the government board, who has been appointed custodian of the building by Secretary Gage, will leave for Omaha Friday or Saturday, transferring his office from the Smithsonian institution to the Gate City at that time.  Mr. Cox says that the whole of the Smithsonian exhibit is now enroute with the exception of one car, which will be forwarded this week.  In his capacity of secretary of the board Mr. Cox has thus far issued requisitions for transportation to the following government employes detailed to the Omaha Exposition, and who are now on the grounds or enroute:  G. A. Schneider and R. J. Conway, fish commission; C. H. Brekwith, treasurer; S. I. Slack, W. G. Brownlow, J. B. Brownlow, postoffice; S. J. Logan, E. H. Behuke, A. C. Anderson, navy; G. B. Sixworth, C. R. Dodge, J. A. Wilson, agriculture; W. V. Cox and J. L. Farmer, representatives of board.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ARRANGING THE COUNTY'S FINE DISPLAY</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commissioners Decide on the Plans for Decorating the Booth in the Agricultural Building and Begin Work.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The county commissioners have decided on the plans for decorating the space Douglas county will occupy in the Agricultural building at the exposition and the details are being worked out.  The space allotted to the county is in the extreme northwest corner of the building, just to the left of the main entrance on the west, as one enters that end of the structure.  It is sixty-seven feet long and thirty-three feet deep, with a ceiling twenty-five feet high.</p>
                            <p>The front of the Douglas county space and 
                            
                            <pb n="101" xml:id="TMISB04-101"/>
                            
                            also the east end, will be worked out in a series of arches.  The base of each arch will be of wood, worked in with colored grains, giving them the appearance of mottled marble.  The columns above the bases and supporting the arches will be glass tubes, four inches in diameter and six feet long.  They will be filled with colored seeds.  These arches will lead into alcoves, all of which will be backed up with canopies of sheaf grains and grasses.  There will be two main arches opening onto the main aisle running lengthwise through the building from east to west, just in front of the exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Sitting on a throne back of the arch, King Corn will reign in all his glory, while a few feet to the west and facing the second large arch, his consort, Queen of the Valley, will occupy a position.  Both these figures will be of heroic size.  The king will be built of clay and, while the material is still soft, it will be covered with kernels of corn.  The crown for the king will be of yellow corn, while his face will be worked out in white and red.  His robes will be of the leaves of the cereal, with the colors blending so as to give a rich and finished appearance.  The throne on which the king will sit will be of different colored corn, the kernels being stuck into the great clay chair.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GORGEOUS WORK IN GRASS.</head>
                            <p>The Queen of the Valley will be all that her name implies.  Instead of being built up of grain, she will be constructed of clay and will be clothed in grasses.  Her face and the exposed portions of her person will be covered with grass seeds.  Her crown will be of the same material, though golden in color.  Her drapery, as well as the throne on which she will sit, will be covered with grasses, the bright and the modest colors blending in the most perfect harmony.</p>
                            <p>Along the front facing of the Douglas county space and well up toward the ceiling will be the words:  "Douglas County Nebraska."  This lettering will be in corn of different colors.  The letters will each be two feet square and will be made from corn shelled from the cob and stuck on heavy canvas, the space between the letters being covered with some other variety of grain.  The space back of this frontage and between the king and queen will be occupied by huge pyramids of glass jars, filled with all kinds of grain, and extending from the floor to the ceiling.  The east end of the exhibit space will be worked up to harmonize with the front, the style of arches and the work on the front being identical with that along the main aisle, though everything will be upon a somewhat smaller scale.</p>
                            <p>Inside of the Douglas county space on the west wall space will be the relief map of the county, worked out in grains and grasses, together with the seeds of the products of the soil.  This map will show the location of the farms of the county, the school houses, the towns, the railroads, the wagon roads and the general topography.  On the north wall two figures will be constructed of grains and seeds, but just what these figures will be the authorities refuse to state.  They declare that they are preparing a very pleasant surprise for the people and are not quite ready to give out their plans.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GLORIES OF THE CEILING.</head>
                            <p>The ceiling over the Douglas county space will be laid out in stars, squares and circles, the Ak-Sar-Ben colors to predominate and fill the space between the designs.  From each of the ceiling designs there will hang pendants made of the grains and grasses of the county, each individual design to be of a color different from its neighbor, sheaf grain and grasses to be worked in to blend the colors and not produce a coarse and heavy effect.  From every pendant from the ceiling electric light bulbs will shed their rays, though most of them will be hidden from view, so that instead of seeing the bright glare, there will be nothing visible except the diffused rays.</p>
                            <p>The designs for the Douglas county exhibit are all being prepared in the building at Twenty-fourth and Hamilton streets and most of them are well along in the way of completion.  A large force of boys and girls are at work assorting the grains and seeds, while another force is at work stitching them upon the canvas.  The work at the Agricultural building is making good progress, the frame work about the space being about completed.  As soon as this is done, the designs will be taken out to the grounds and put in place, after which the decorators will be put in charge of the exhibit.  The figures of King Corn and the Queen of the Valley are being made, the artist having completed his small models and is now at work upon those of the heroic size.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the Douglas county exhibit, the commissioners say that in their judgment it will be the finest and most attractive agricultural display upon the grounds.  They say they propose to show the visitors to the exposition that Douglas is the banner county in the state and that the soil will produce any and everything that can be raised in the temperate zone.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Carpenters Start on the Iowa Building&#8212;Other Progress.</head>
                            <p>The working force on the bluff tract of the exposition grounds was increased this morning by a large gang of carpenters who began work on the Iowa state building.  P. H. Winn of Council Bluffs has the contract for this building, a temporary shed to serve as a workshop is being erected and work on the building will be commenced at once.  <unclear reason="torn"/> progress and no doubt remains about it being finished on time.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the Nebraska building is about completed and presents a very handsome appearance.  The walls have been tinted in an artistic manner under the personal direction of the hostess of the building, Miss Mellona Butterfield, and the electric wiring is finished.  The woodwork has been finished in "hard oil."  It has been decided to paint the plaster on the exterior of the building a pale cream color, leaving the staff white, after the plan adopted for the Illinois building.  This will improve the appearance of the building very much and will make it one of the handsomest on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>A mosaic floor is being laid in the rotunda of the Illinois building and a large force of workmen are engaged in putting the finishing touches to the interior.  The art annex is nearing completion.  The Wisconsin building is in the hands of the staff contractors and the decoration already in place gives promise of the handsome appearance of the completed building.</p>
                            <p>The Montana building is enclosed and is one of the most attractive buildings on the bluff tract.  The exterior is covered with weather-boarding and shingles, differing from the other buildings on this tract.</p>
                            <p>The Georgia building is taking form.  The framework of the flat dome which will surmount the main entrance has been reared and the staff workers will begin covering the framework within a few days.</p>
                            <p>The landscaping of the bluff tract is still being prosecuted with great vigor, Landscape Architect Ulrich giving the matter his personal attention.  Beds for flowers have been laid out in great profusion.  The space to be devoted to lawn is now covered with a good growth of blue grass produced by sowing seed about two weeks ago.  The grass is nearly two inches high, and the appearance of the tract is greatly changed by the fresh green color.  Seeds and bulbs for the flower beds are being received in quantities from exhibiting florists, and the next two weeks will be the bluff tract covered with young plants.  The planting of bushes and shrubbery of all kinds is still in progress.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mayer writes that the French minister of commerce, M.

                            <p>The Bee again expresses its dissatisfaction with the conduct of the exposition by the members of the executive committee and demands the selection of a general manager.  The question that naturally arises with one who has observed the manner in which the Bee has been used to club into line the executive committee is:  "What is Rosewater after now?"  What concession will he demand of this executive committee as a condition for a cessation of hostilities?</p>
                            <p>For a long time the Bee assailed the executive committee, charging that committee with gross mismanagement.  Then the committee helped Rosewater to vote himself that $3,200 contract and the Bee's criticisms ceased.  Although the directory of the exposition condemned this proceeding, the executive committee has never receded from its action.  It would seem that this executive committee has earned a relief from the Bee's assaults.  The members of that committee enjoy distinction by the fact that the directory found it necessary to warn them not to make exposition contracts with one another.  It would seem that they have made sufficient sacrifices to obtain permanent freedom from assaults by the Bee.</p>
                            <p>But Rosewater has learned how readily these gentlemen yield to the club and no one will be surprised if they are required to undergo another drubbing.  On this occasion, however, they will not have the sympathy of any one.  Men who would yield to the Rosewater club do not deserve sympathy.  The executive committee has invited assaults from the Rosewater organ and, without the slightest sympathy for the victims of the club, the public will watch with some degree of interest the answer to the question:  "What does Rosewater want now?"</p>
                            <p>If it is another fat contract Rosewater will probably obtain it.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">WANTED&#8212;A GENERAL MANAGER.</hi></head>
                            <p>More than nine months ago The Bee urged upon the exposition directory the imperative necessity of placing the general supervision of the exposition into the hands of a man vested with the functions of a director general or general manager.  No international exposition has ever yet been held without such an officer at its head and if the experience of other exposition counts for anything, its success depends in a great measure upon the concentration of authority in one officer charged with the active duties and responsibilities of general control.</p>
                            <p>This was also the consensus of opinion of the exposition directory, the only difference being as to the proper time when this action should be taken.</p>
                            <p>When the subject was before the board in the early part of November it was referred to a special committee.  That committee made its report to the full board on November 13, setting forth that in its judgment it was premature to appoint a director general or general manager, but for the time being the committee recommended the employment of a general superintendent of all departments by the executive committee.  Inasmuch as most of his time prior to the opening of the exposition would be devoted to the supervision of construction work, the selection, subject to confirmation by the whole executive committee, was conceded to the manager of the department of grounds and buildings.</p>
                            <p>For reasons never explained this resolution was allowed to remain a dead letter for three months, until the middle of February, when A. C. Foster was named as general superintendent.  The selection of Mr. Foster has met with universal approval and no fault has been found thus far with his performance of the duties devolving upon him.  It is a matter of notoriety, however, that there has been a studious effort to prevent Mr. Foster from being anything more than a minor employe, not in full charge of even one department.</p>
                            <p>Now that we are within one month of the opening of the exposition and when co-ordination of all the business of the exposition is absolutely required to maintain discipline and harmonious co-operations of all departments, the general superintendent should no longer remain a mere figurehead or errand boy for one of the six managers.</p>
                            <p>The time has come for the board of directors to take action on this all important question on which hinges to a great extent the success or failure of the enterprise for which they are responsible.  With the known divergence of opinion in the executive committee on the necessity of concentrated authority in the operation of the exposition, the stockholders and the people generally have a right to expect and demand that the directors discharge their duty without further delay by placing some one in general control of the exposition subject to supervision and direction by the executive committee.  Such action will not be a reflection on any member of the executive committee, none of whom can possibly exercise the functions of a general manager and none of whom will be lowered in rank or deprived of any credit or honor by the creation of a general manager clothed with full executive power in all matters that require personal decision and direction.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>F. N. Chase, secretary of the Iowa Transmississippi commission is in Council Bluffs for the purpose of arranging for the beginning of the exposition work.  The commissioners have decided to open an office in this city and do the active work connected with the erection of the Iowa building and the installation of the exhibit from this side of the river.  He spent the day yesterday in consultation with various members of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association and looking up an office.  No definite arrangements were arrived at, but Secretary Chase concluded to wait until after the meeting of the association and accept the proffer that had been made at the last meeting to assist in securing an office in the Grand hotel.  Contractor Wind held a conference with the secretary yesterday concerning the Iowa building, which he will erect.  The matters discussed referred only to the early commencement of the work, and the assurance was given by the contractor that all of the requirements of his contract would be complied with and the building be ready for the installation of the exhibits within the specified time.</p>

                            <p>President Graham electrified the members of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association at the regular meeting last night by officially informing them that the work of building the big tepee is actually under way.  In connection with a report on the matter of building he declared that all of the red tape business had been gone through with, the plans of the structure approved by the exposition managers and nothing left to be done but to go ahead and complete the building as rapidly as possible.  The report showed that four of the Council Bluffs lumber merchants bid on the lumber and that Col. W. F. Baker's bid was the lowest.  The architects, Woodward Bros., submitted their bill of $125 for plans and it was referred to the committee for further consideration.</p>
                            <p>General Test, from the committee on transportation, presented a communication from General Manager Dickinson, who declared that the Union Pacific company would furnish trains to be run from its Ninth street depot in this city to the exposition grounds whenever the traffic demanded.  A few hours' notification would be all that is required.  He also promised that his company would take up the matter of providing connections for the Missouri Pacific.</p>
                            <p>The finance committee was instructed to round up the exposition buttons and endeavor to ascertain how many of them had strayed away and endeavor to find a market for the remainder of them.  The chairman of the committee was also instructed to pay all bills for labor upon presentation.  A committee was appointed for the purpose of fixing the salary of Secretary Judson for the period since March 1, he not having drawn anything since that time.  The committee will report at the next meeting.</p>

                            <p>The scale of wages to be paid to the member of the corps of exposition guards was decided by the executive committee yesterday afternoon as follows:  Captains, $75; first lieutenants, $65; second lieutenants, $60; sergeants, $50; corporals, $45; privates, $40.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall and Major Llewellyn, commandant of the guard, have been putting in all their spare time during the last few days in opening and tabulating the several thousand applications which have been filed for these positions.  Several days will be occupied in getting this information into shape and getting into communication with the writers, who hail from all parts of the country.  The guards will not be on duty until June 1.  The details of the uniform have not been decided.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles was authorized to request Governor Holcomb and Mayor Moores to issue proclamations declaring June 1 to be a public holiday.</p>
                            <p>The contract for making the concrete steps and coping about the Agriculture Liberal Arts, Art and Manufactures buildings was awarded to R. C. Strehlow, the price being $500.</p>

                            <p>E. L. Danforth, secretary of the Minnesota commission, writes as follows to the Department of Publicity and Promotion, under date of April 27, regarding the condition of exposition matters in his state:</p>
                            <p>Our executive and finance committees held a three hours' session this afternoon with most satisfactory results.  The general situation was thoroughly canvassed, showing that we are all right financially and from this time forward we shall bend every effort to complete our exhibits.  We shall have a man at Omaha the fore part of next week at work on our agricultural exhibit and we are already at work gathering material for all other exhibits.</p>
                            <p>It is possible that we may by force of circumstances be a little late in some departments, but you can rest assured we will do the best we can.  We expect active building operations to be under the way by the first week in May on our state building.  As I have advised you, I expect our people will send me down to take charge of our building and represent the state during the entire period of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>It looks to me very much as if the Spanish war will greatly advance exposition interests.  I am constantly met by fool arguments that it will hurt our prospects, but generally in about two minutes convince a man quite to the contrary.</p>

                            <p>Preparations are being made for the installation of the Montana exhibit in the Mines and the Agriculture buildings.  The space allotted to the state in these buildings are surrounded by muslin screens about seven feet high, to shut out the prying eyes of visitors, and behind these thin walls a number of men are preparing the exhibit of the resources of Montana.  A striking object  in the material at hand for the mineral exhibit is a huge piece of coal about six feet long, four feet high and four feet thick, weighing 6,500 pounds.  This great block is contained in a crate made of pine timber 6x6 inches in size, held together with one-inch bolts.  The mineral specimens are contained in barrels, some of the barrels and contents weighing 900 pounds.  The agricultural material, which is visible in the enclosure being decorated in the Agricultural building, consists simply of decorative grains and grasses, the main portion of the exhibit not having arrived.</p>

                            <p>J. C. Souther, city ticket agent of the Milwaukee road in Chicago, was in the city yesterday afternoon in the interest of the Chinese exhibit.  Mr. Souther says Wong Chin Foo is persona non grata with his former business associates and they have concluded to drop him.  They consulted Mr. Souther and asked him to represent them in a private capacity in adjusting matters with the exposition officials in order that their money paid by Foo for ground space may not be lost.  Foo's option on this ground will not expire until May 1 and Mr. Souther submitted a proposition of settlement to the exposition management yesterday.  He says if his proposition is accepted the "show will go on" just the same, regardless of Foo.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Chan Fan Moore, an attache of the Chinese legation at Washington, who has been designated by the Chinese minister to represent the government of China at the exposition, arrived in the city last night, accompanied by Mr. Chow, also an attache of the legation.  He expects to remain only until Sunday, when he will start for San Francisco, but will return to Omaha in time to take part in the ceremonies attendant upon the opening of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Moore and Mr. Chow visited the exposition grounds this morning in company with Manager Rosewater, who pointed out the various buildings and points of interest.  Mr. Moore was greatly pleased with the beauty and extent of the preparations in progress, and was especially interested in learning all that pertained to the participation of the Chinese.</p>
                            <p>After inspecting the grounds the party returned to the Millard hotel, and at noon Mr. Moore took lunch with the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>After reaching his room at the hotel Mr. Moore consented to an interview by a representative of The Bee.  Mr. Moore speaks English fluently, and explained that he had been in this country about eight years, at different times, as an attache of the Chinese legislation.  He expressed in an unreserved manner his gratification at the evidences of substantial progress in exposition preparations which he had just witnessed, and said he had been pleased to see the real beauty of the grounds and buildings.</p>

                            <p>"I was prepared to see something very beautiful," said he, "for I have seen many pictures of your buildings and grounds in the east, so that I was not as greatly surprised as I might have been had I not known what you were doing.  It is evident that you are going to have a very large exposition and I shall take pleasure in spending the summer here as the representative of my government.  I am here by the direction of the Chinese minister, and shall report to him what I have seen and also all information regarding the interests of our people who are connected with the exposition.  I expect to leave Omaha in a day or two and will go direct to San Francisco, but will return in time for the opening of the exposition.  At that time I shall take a house and establish myself comfortably until the <choice><sic>eposition</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice> closes.</p>
                            <p>"I cannot say as to just what our minister intends with regard to our participation in the exposition," continued Mr. Moore.  "My report to him is for the purpose of informing him as to the exact status of affairs here, and he will then instruct me what is to be done.' '</p>
                            <p>The conversation drifted to the war with Spain and Mr. Moore remarked that he had only recently returned from Havana.  "I went to Cuba a little over two years ago," said he, "and left there but a few days before your consul general, Mr. Lee, came away.  I was in Havana when the Maine was blown up and <choice><sic>sa wthe</sic><corr>saw the</corr></choice> whole of that terrible affair.  It was my pleasure to take part in the dinner given by the Havana Yacht club to the officers of the Maine soon after they <choice><sic>arrive din</sic><corr>arrived in</corr></choice> the harbor, but it was a sad <choice><sic>dut yto atend</sic><corr>duty to attend</corr></choice> the burial of those poor sailors," and Mr. Moore shrugged his shoulders as he spoke of the gruesome sight.</p>
                            <p>"I came to the conclusion that there was going to be trouble there," said he, quickly changing the subject with a smile, "and I returned to Washington.  From there I came here on a tour of investigation."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Moore had heard some terrible stories about the hot weather in Omaha in the summer time and inquired rather anxiously about the temperature as compared with Washington.  When assured that Omaha was a much cooler spot than the national capital in the summer season, he seemed relieved and made inquiry regarding a residence for the summer.</p>

                            <p>A rumor has been persistently circulated of late to the effect that the exposition would be postponed on account of the war and inquiries regarding the truthfulness of this report have been coming into the offices of the exposition officials from all quarters.

                            <p>There is absolutely no foundation for any such rumors.  The executive committee has never considered the possibility of postponing the exposition on account of the war or for any other reason.  The effect of the war upon the attendance has been discussed very generally by people interested in the exposition, but the concensus of opinion on the part of those best qualified to judge has been that the effect of the war will be very slight and the tendency will be to increase the attendance rather than diminish it.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Structure to Be Completed Inside of Twenty Days.</head>
                            <p>The Iowa building promises to be a record breaker in the rapidity of its construction.  Although it has been but two days since active work was commenced on the building it is already well advanced.  The main floor is to be about six feet above the level of the surrounding ground and this portion of the building up to this point is enclosed.  This means that the foundation is in, the floor joists are in place and the floor is laid.  Contractor Winn of Council Bluffs is required to have the building completed by May 20, and he is working as many men as can be employed to advantage.  There is a considerable quantity of staff to go on the building and Mr. Winn says the entire building and the circular colonnades extending from either end to a considerable distance in front of the building will be finished on time.</p>
                            <p>The nearest neighbor of the Iowa building is the Pottawattamie county wigwam.  The space has been staked out and some of the lumber is on the ground.  A force of men under the direction of Chairman Graham of the building committee is at work on the big tepee and they are out for a race with the Iowa building.</p>

                            <p>There has been some uncertainty as to whether New York would have a state building at the exposition.  This has now been dispelled.  New York will have a building.  Last night word was received from the New York state commission to hold the site selected; that the money was ready and a building will be erected.  Details will soon be known.</p>
                            <p>Word from Tacoma is to the effect that Washington will also have a state building.</p>

                            <byline>BY CHARLES AUSTIN BATES.</byline>
                            <p>In many respects, advertising by exhibit is very excellent advertising.</p>
                            <p>It is advertising reduced to first principles.  If well done, it can not fail to be profitable.  The object lesson is the lesson easiest learned and longest remembered.</p>
                            <p>Instead of pictures and descriptions, it presents the article itself.  It makes its appeal directly to the senses.</p>
                            <p>An exhibit at a fair or exposition, where the presence of a large number of people is certain, is generally worth much more than it costs.  It brings the advertiser face to face with the people, to whom he wants to sell goods.  The minds of these people are in a receptive attitude.  They have come to see and to learn.  They are anxious to see everything there is to be seen, and to accumulate all the information possible.</p>
                            <p>There could be no better time to attract and hold their attention.</p>
                            <p>Food show advertising is very effective.  It is surprising to see how people flock to food shows, and how eager they are to see and to taste and to secure samples to take home with them.</p>
                            <p>These people are not actuated by mere idle curiosity; neither do they go to food shows because they are hungry, or because they expect to collect enough gimcracks to coldly furnish forth a luncheon table.</p>
                            <p>They are women whose constant study is to provide something new or something exceptionally good to tempt the appetites of their husbands and families.  They expect the food show to furnish them with a lot of information&#8212;with enough pointers to enable them to give the family something new for weeks.</p>
                            <p>That this is a great opportunity for the man who has invented something new to eat goes without saying.</p>
                            <p>There is one thing that the man who advertises by exhibit, by demonstration, or by giving away samples in any manner, should be very careful to avoid.  He should never yield to the temptation to distribute samples that are even a little bit better than his goods will average.</p>
                            <p>The effect of a great deal of this sort of advertising is totally nullified by this prevalent practice.</p>
                            <p>It is quite natural to want to put your best foot forward, but sometimes it's bad policy.</p>
                            <p>Suppose, for instance, that you are introducing a new cracker.  You give away a ton or so at a food show in Hackensack.  They are just the very best crackers you know how to make&#8212;a good bit better than your crackers will average.</p>
                            <p>The women of Hackensack unanimously conclude that your crackers are the very best crackers that ever came out of a crackery.  They besiege the grocers of Hackensack for your crackers.  If they don't sell them, they've simply got to get them/</p>
                            <p>So far, so good&#8212;your advertising is having just the effect you wanted to produce.</p>
                            <p>But when they get the crackers, the women find that they aren't up to the high standard the samples set.  That will be your finish in Hackensack.</p>
                            <p>The crackers may be good.  They may be better crackers than anybody else can sell for the same money, but that makes no difference.</p>

                            <p>The women feel that you have deceived them, and they'll abuse you and your crackers till doomsday.</p>
                            <p>Of course, every exhibit should be as tasteful and attractive as possible.  No pains nor expense should be spared to draw people's attention, to please them, and to make a strongly favorable impression upon them.  When samples are served or handed out, great care should be taken to do it in a pleasing manner.  This is one way of putting your best foot forward that will have only good results.  But putting your big apples at the top of the barrels, so to speak, will do you harm instead of good.</p>
                            <p>An absolute essential to effective advertising by exhibit is good literature.  Every person who p<unclear reason="covered"/> look, to taste, or to get a<unclear reason="covered"/> should carry away some ad<unclear reason="covered"/> matter.</p>
                            <p>It is a very bad plan to <unclear reason="covered"/> matter in more than one piece <unclear reason="covered"/> will take one piece of adverti<unclear reason="covered"/> carry it away with him; but <unclear reason="covered"/> it's altogether too much to ex<unclear reason="covered"/> to accept several.  If he d<unclear reason="covered"/> them, the chances are he w<unclear reason="covered"/> them away.</p>
                            <p>A booklet is the best thin<unclear reason="covered"/> booklet you are able to tell <unclear reason="covered"/> lot about your goods in ve<unclear reason="covered"/> compass.  A good booklet is apt to be kept and carried home.  It doesn't look discouraging.</p>
                            <p>Make your booklet short.  Say what you have to say in as few words as possible, and use short, simple words.  Have it printed in large, clear type, and use plenty of pretty pictures to help carry the reader along to the end.</p>
                            <p>Don't be afraid of spending money on the cover.  A handsome cover design in colors will double the effectiveness of the booklet&#8212;twice as many people will keep it and read it.</p>
                            <p>Exhibit advertising is an entering wedge&#8212;an introduction&#8212;and should be considered only as such.</p>
                            <p>It is a very hard matter to get people to try a new thing.  People are wedded <unclear reason="covered"/></p>
                            <p>But there are breakers ahead.  Other people are after our cracker trade.  You won't be allowed to hold your position without fighting for it.  Your entering wedge was a good thing, but your task is not ended.</p>
                            <p>By good advertising by means of posters, circulars, and newspaper space, you must keep pegging away at the fact that your crackers are better than anybody's crackers, or you'll soon make the unpleasant discovery that your advantage was only a temporary one.</p>
                            <p>Advertising by exhibit stands, chronologically speaking, at the head of the line.  But it is only one of the auxiliary branches of the great art of good advertising.</p>
                            <p>A great many shrewd advertisers rely mainly for force in their advertising, on iteration and reiteration.  They take one good argument, and repeat it day after day in the same paper, until its significance is fairly pounded into the understanding of the most obtuse.  The billboards excel in this direction.  One may obtain more tireless repetition in a single day from posters than it is possible to acquire in months from the newspapers.  By recourse to the latter, he may, at best, greet the reader twice a day, one in the morning, and again in the evening.  The boards, however, are everywhere, and work all day long.  And they cost&#8212;O! so much less than newspaper space.</p>

                            <p>Once upon a time a printer brought to Booth for inspection the proof of a new poster, which, after the manner of its kind, announced the actor as "the eminent tragedian, Edwin Booth."  Mr. Booth did not fully approve of it.  "I wish you'd leave out that 'eminent tragedian' business.  I'd much rather have it simple 'Edwin Booth.'" he said.  "Very good, sir."  The next week the actor saw the first of the new bills on the boards.  His request had been carried out to the letter.  The poster announced the coming engagement of "Simple Edwin Booth."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Interior Decorations of the Great Building Are Nearly Finished and Work of Installation is Being Hurried Forward.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The installation of the exhibits in the Government building is in active progress and the interior of the great building presents a most animated sight.  The walls have been covered with burlap in two shades.  A dado of dark maroon twelve feet in height extends entirely around the building; above this and reaching to the ceiling burlap of the natural color is used, the result being an effect of red and old gold, which makes a very handsome background for the exhibits.  The space assigned to each of the governmental departments is separated from the adjoining space by a partition twelve feet in height, extending to the main aisle, which runs the entire length of the building through the center.  These partitions are covered with red burlap and are finished at the top with a neat moulding.</p>
                            <p>For the last two weeks the exhibits of the several departments have been arriving at a rapid rate and the space to be occupied by each department has been gradually filled with huge crates and boxes containing the thousand-and-one things constituting the exhibits.  Decorator Morey has had full possession of the walls up to this time, but he has now completed his task of covering them and has ascended with his workmen to the lofty trusses which support the roof, while the representative of each department has taken possession of his particular portion of the building and commenced unpacking his wares.  The members of the Board of Management of the government exhibit are expected to arrive in the city early this week and when they arrive the work of installation will proceed with dispatch.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FISH DISPLAY.</head>
                            <p>The display of the Fish commission has reached a more advanced stage than any of the others from the very nature of the arrangements for it.  The live fish will be displayed in a tunnel-like grotto which has been under construction for the last two months.  This occupies the northwest corner of the building and forms three sides of a rectangle.  The interior of the tunnel represents a rocky cavern with a high arched ceiling and along the sides are the tanks in which the live fish are to be exhibited.  These tanks are about six feet in length, three feet high and four feet in width.  The side of each tank which is set into the wall of the tunnel is of plate glass and the bottom is covered with rocks and boulders.  The tanks are filled with filtered water and no light can enter the tunnel except that which passes through the water from above.  The result of this arrangement is to make the interior of the tank as light as day and the magnifying effect of the water makes the rocks appear about twice as large as they are in reality.  The effect will probably be the same with the fish.  In the corners of the grotto are large oval tanks in which will be shown fancy gold and silver fish.  The water in these tanks will be lighted from beneath by electric lights and the reflection of this light from the shining sides of the darting fish will be a pretty sight.  Water will fall into these large tanks over a pile of rocks in the back, representing miniature cataracts.</p>
                            <p>The tunnel may be entered at either end and these ends have been finished in an elaborate manner.  Small figures surmount the entrance.  There are several of these figures, one representing a fisher maiden with a net of fish, another an Indian girl in a canoe, another a daring fisherman astride a dolphin, etc.  The arrangement for the live fish exhibit was designed and its construction supervised by G. C. Schneider, an attache of the Fish commission.  The design and general arrangement of the tunnel is said by those connected with the other department exhibits who have seen the displays made by the commission at former expositions, to be far superior to any previous attempt in this direction.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PICTURES THAT NEVER GOT THERE.</head>
                            <p>The exhibit of the Postoffice department is the only other display which has made any particular progress in the way of getting ready for the inspection of the public.  There is one feature of this display which will undoubtedly attract a very great amount of attention in the present excited state of the public mind over anything that pertains to war.  This is an exhibit of photographs of soldiers taken during the rebellion which miscarried and landed in the dead letter division of the Postoffice department.  There are about 15,000 of these old pictures and they form a most interesting collection for a variety of reasons.</p>
                            <p>During the civil war it was a common thing for soldiers in the northern armies who happened to be near a town to have their pictures taken to send to wives, sweethearts, parents or friends at home.  In thousands of cases the addresses were defective in some particular or became entirely separated from the picture in the course of the rough handling to which some of the mails were necessarily subjected at times and the postoffice authorities were unable to deliver them.  They were preserved, however, and have now become a very valuable collection from a historical standpoint.  There were many thousands of them originally, but large numbers of them were claimed from time to time and the number has now been reduced to about 15,000.  These are contained in frames holding about 100 each and are so hung that they may be examined with great ease by those caring to do so.</p>

                            <p>These pictures are a strange sight in the light of modern photography.  They are all of the size known as the "card de visite" and some of them are most fearful and wonderful examples of the horrors of half baked photography.  All are faded and yellow with age, or imperfect treatment originally, and some of them are sadly dilapidated, but they tell the story of a generation now almost past and gone.  Some of them are pictures of men high in rank in the army, as indicated by their uniform&#8212;men in the prime of life, hearty and rugged.  Others are pictures of mere boys, some of them wearing their uniforms with a self-conscious pride that tells of the novelty of the experience.  Some are taken "in camp," probably by a traveling photographer, but the majority are "interiors," and the crude appearance of the "property," is really painful.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of photography, it may be stated that the Board of Management of the Government building has an official photographer on its staff.  Prof. Charles Richards Dodge, chief of the Bureau of Fibre Investigations of the Agricultural department, is the photographer, and a "dark room" with all the accessories has been fitted up for his use in the building.  His duties are to take photographs of each of the departmental exhibits and these are preserved in the archives at Washington as records of the occasion.</p>
                            <p>The Government building has been closed to visitors and from now until the exposition is opened visitors will not be allowed inside.  Guards are on duty at each door and none are allowed to enter except those having special permission to do so.</p>

                            <p>The eastern railways and the managers of the various excursion agencies are taking active steps to divert to the west the tide of travel which, under ordinary circumstances, turns to European resorts with the approach of the summer season.  Since active hostilities have commenced with Spain a trip across the ocean is fraught with considerable uncertainty, and the registry lists of ocean liners are conclusive evidence that the travel from America to Europe will be decidedly light during the coming summer.  In order to meet this condition and supply the demand for "a place to go," the east is being flooded with literature describing the beauties of a tour of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Eastern and western roads have combined to influence pleasure seekers and the Transmississippi Exposition is coming in for a large share of advertising as an attraction.  Exposition literature is being included in the printed matter issued by railroads both east and west, and would-be tourists are offered the inducement of a stop-over in Omaha, in order to visit the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The excursion agencies are working in the same direction and two of them, the Raymond-Whitcomb company of Boston, and V. C. Ward of Columbus, O., have already announced a series of "personally conducted," in which Omaha and the expositions are made features.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion is co-operating most actively with these different roads and agencies and hopes by this means to secure a largely increased attendance at the exposition from the east.</p>

                            <p>The telegrams from New York regarding the erection of a state building on the exposition grounds have been confirmed by letters from Secretary Wheeler of the commission, and the construction of the building will be commenced at once.  The contract has been let to Dunnavant &amp; Thompson of this city, upon plans made by them.  These show a building of pleasing appearance, 56x88 feet on the ground and thirty-four feet in height.  The building is a rectangular mass surmounted by a clear story and surrounded by a portico thirteen feet in width.  The architecture is modified renaissance.</p>
                            <p>Opening from the portico is a spacious vestibule, beyond which appears a large room lighted from the clear story windows.  This room is thirty feet square, and opening from it on the right is a room sixteen feet square, intended for women, and on the opposite side is a similar room intended for men.  Offices for the commission are at the back of the building.  The contract for the structure provides that it shall be completed by June 10.</p>
                            <p>In a letter to the Department of Publicity and Promotion Secretary Wheeler says that the commission will occupy the state building as soon as it is completed, and he asks that a day in the latter part of June or some time in October be designated as "New York day."</p>

                            <p>When Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the Floriculture bureau, opened his desk to begin another week's work, he found on it a small packet covered with printed matter in a language which the attaches of the office had vainly tried to decipher.  They made all kinds of wild guesses regarding the nationality of the language, but none of them hit anywhere near the truth.  Prof. Taylor solved the riddle by pronouncing it Russian, and then he read the inscription as though such a proceeding was an everyday occurrence.  According to the professor, the inscription conveyed the information that the packet contained gourd seeds from Emmer &amp; Sen, florists of Moscow, in the land of the czar.  The professor explained that these gourds grow as large as the head of an ordinary man, and are extensively used as dippers in their native land.  The seeds were sent by these far-away florists as exhibits in the floral display of the exposition, and they will be planted on the exposition grounds at some of the numerous points where climbing vines are designed to form a part of the decoration.</p>
                            <p>Alongside this packet was a larger one bearing the card of James Semple of Bellevue, Pa., an aster specialist of note.  This packet contained seeds of many different varieties of asters and these also, will be very carefully prepared under the direction of Prof. Taylor and will form a part of the floral display which will beautify the bluff tract.</p>

                            <p>The latest reports from Texas indicate that the people of that state who are determined that the Lone Star state shall be represented at the exposition have taken matters in their own hands and have ousted the board of commissioners, which has been doing little but wasting time since it was appointed, and have appointed a new commission which they say is composed of men who are interested in seeing the state well represented and will make an exhibit of the resources of the state which will be a credit to the largest state in the union.</p>
                            <p>This new move is the direct result of the combination of the Houston Business League with the San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass Railway Immigration association which was effected a few weeks ago.  These organizations have assumed the entire burden of making a Texas exhibit and have raised the money with which to meet all the expenses, so that a good exhibit is assured from this state.  The new organization has communicated these facts to the exposition management and has asked that a new Texas Exposition commission to be named in place of the old commission which is pronounced officially dead.  The following members of the new commission are recommended by the Texas "wideawakes" and will undoubtedly be appointed by the exposition management:  C. S. Penfield, Houston, chairman of the executive committee; Rufus Cage, Houston, secretary of executive committee; M. G. Ranney, Yoakum; W. A. Childress, Houston; O. M. Peterson, Normania; G. F. Lupton, San Antonio; R. M. Johnston, Houston; Charles Peterson, Rock Island; Charles Dillingham, Houston; Cyrus Thompson, Lockhart; F. A. R. Reichardt, Houston; E. B. Cole, Corpus Christi; B. A. Reisner, Houston; R. T. Krehot, Hallettsville; B. R. Warner, Houston; F. R. Graves, Kansas City; T. W. House, Houston; J. C. Haverton, Cuero; E. C. Crawford, Houston; John Wellacy, Portland.</p>
                            <p>Vice President S. J. T. Johnson, who has been working with might and main to bring about a condition of affairs which would result in a display being made, will still hold his position as vice president for the state.</p>

Swanson, who will erect the Kansas building on the exposition grounds, have arrived <choice><sic>n</sic><corr>in</corr></choice> Omaha to commence the erection of the Kansas building and to look over the spaces in the several buildings assigned to that state for exhibits.  Contractor Swanson bought the lumber for the state building and will commence work at once.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Worrally visited the exposition grounds in company with Commissioners Glick and Frost and inspected the spaces in the Agriculture, Mines, Horticulture and Liberal Arts buildings which have been assigned to Kansas.  Prof. Worrall will make the designs for all of the <choice><sic>ansas</sic><corr>Kansas</corr></choice> displays and <choice><sic>willl</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> superintend the erection of the booths.  He has had very extended experience in this direction, <choice><sic>hs</sic><corr>his</corr></choice> first state work in this direction having been to design the Kansas exhibit at the Philadelphia Centennial exposition, which brought Kansas prominently before the world as the producer of giant corn as well as other commodities.  He also designed the display made at the Atlanta exposition in 1881, and the great <choice><sic>ralroad</sic><corr>railroad</corr></choice> agricultural display in the Agricultural Department at Washington.  The members of the Kansas commission rely upon Prof. Worrall to design the displays in all lines which shall eclipse anything else <choice><sic>whch</sic><corr>which</corr></choice> may be attempted by any of the other states.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. <choice><sic>Glck</sic><corr>Glick</corr></choice> and Frost both say that the situation in their state with reference to exposition matters is very promising and the commissioners are each doing good work <choice><sic>n</sic><corr>in</corr></choice> the <choice><sic>sectons assgned</sic><corr>sections assigned</corr></choice> to them.

                            <head type="sub">Officials Come to Put the Display in Place in the Building.</head>
                            <p>A party of government officials and employes has arrived in the city to begin active work on the preparation of the exhibits in the Government building on the exposition grounds.  This party comprises W. V. Cox, secretary of the Board of Management of the Government building; Prof. Charles Richards Dodge, chief of the Bureau of Fibre Investigations of the Department of Agriculture; Harry Brigham, son of the assistant secretary of agriculture; James L. Farmer, stenographer for Secretary Cox.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Cox is the executive officer of the Board of Management and will also be custodian of the Government building, the latter appointment having just been made by the secretary of the treasury.  He will remain in Omaha until the exposition is closed and the material comprising the exhibits taken care of.  Mr. Cox has had long experience in exposition work, having been directly connected with every exhibit made by the government at expositions since 1883.    His opinion regarding the display which will be made by the departments of the government is, therefore, the opinion of an expert and entitled to great weight.</p>
                            <p>"I am greatly pleased with the beautiful building which has been erected by the government," said Mr. Cox.  "It is the handsomest structure ever erected by the government at any exposition in which it has participated.  The exhibits which will be made in the building by the various departments will be superior to all previous attempts in that line.  The officers having immediate charge of the several departments have all had experience in other expositions, and they have profited by that experience with the result that all that is not desirable in an exhibit has been eliminated and its place is filled with material which improves the display and makes it more interesting and instructive."</p>
                            <p>The first action taken by Secretary Cox after his arrival was to telegraph to Washington for more assistance and the work of installation will be pushed vigorously.  Nearly every department now has a representative on the ground the active work of installation has been commenced.  In order to insure harmony in the general appearance of the interior of the building a committee on installation and decoration has been appointed to supervise the colors used by the different departments and oversee the general arrangement of the exhibits.  This committee consists of Prof. F. W. Clarke of the Interior department, G. E. Kemper, assistant supervising <choice><sic>archtect</sic><corr>architect</corr></choice>, and Colonel J. B. Brownlow of the Postoffice department.  This committee will arrive within a very few days.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Cox is stopping at the Millard hotel and will maintain an office that as well as in the Government building on the grounds.</p>

                            <p>Scaffolding is being erected in the dome of the Nebraska building for the purpose of repairing the plaster on the inside of the dome which has fallen off in many places.

                            <head type="sub">The members of the Irish-American Exposition club convened at the office of Edward Walsh in the Paxton block last evening, but the attendance was so large that they found it necessary to adjourn to the hall on the sixth floor.  Many committees were appointed for the purpose of exerting every effort available to further the interests of the exposition and the Irish-Americans while in attendance.</head>
                            <p>The next meeting will be held on Friday evening of this week in the Arlington block.</p>
                            <p>The following resolutions were unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, A state of war is now existing between the republic of the United State and the kingdom of Spain, and the people of the United States have endeavored in every possible way to consistent with national dignity and honor to avoid such a crisis, but finally, with the greatest reluctance, were compelled to declare themselves; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, We realize the disastrous consequences which attend and follow persistent aggressive warfare waged by powerful belligerents; therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we, the Irish-Americans of Omaha and South Omaha, hail with delight the tidings of the signal victory won by the American sailors under the command of the gallant commodore, Dewey, in the naval conflict with the Spanish squadron on the morning of May 1, 1898, off the eastern coast of the Philippine islands.  Believing and hoping that so decisive a blow may sufficiently prove the superiority of American soldiery and tend to draw to an early close the war which now exists between these nations.</p>

                            <p>The joint committee of this city and South Omaha, which is making the arrangements for Bohemian day at the exposition and for the Bohemian Turners' tournament, considered the advisability of postponing both dates.  This action is contemplated for the purpose of holding, if possible, this Bohemian reunion and gathering at the same time that the Catholic Society of St. James holds its diocesan convention in this city.  August 27 was fixed as Bohemian day and the tournament is set to convene on September 25.</p>
                            <p>The matter was thoroughly talked over and it was finally determined to hold both gatherings on September 10, if possible.  The following committee was appointed to act in the matter:  Father Vranek, Mrs. John Konvalin, Frank Pokorny, Joseph Sterba and Anton Kment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">North Nebraska and South Dakota Newspaper Men at Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The editors of newspapers along the lines of the Elkhorn railroad in Nebraska were the guests of the exposition officials today, and they were taken care of in a manner calculated to put them in touch with the exposition and all that has been done in connection with the great fair.  Many of the newspaper representatives arrived in the city last night and others came in this morning.  To the number of about ninety they assembled at the corner of Farnam and Fifteenth streets at 9:30 o'clock this morning and were there taken in charge by Major Clarkson of the exposition and taken to the exposition grounds on a special trolley train.  A trip was made over the grounds by the whole party, the visitors who had not seen the grounds and buildings before expressing the greatest astonishment at the magnificence of the preparations, and those who had visited the grounds at some previous time being even more surprised than their colleagues at the rapid progress which has been made.  After passing all through the grounds and buildings the party returned down town and were entertained at luncheon.</p>
                            <p>Major Clarkson presided at the luncheon and short talks followed the cigars.  Manager Rosewater and G. M. Hitchcock spoke briefly regarding the exposition and the newspapers and a number of the guests expressed themselves regarding their entertainment and the exposition in general.</p>
                            <p>The visitors left for home on the regular afternoon trains.</p>
                            <p>The following are those constituting the party:</p>

                            <p>The list of foreign states which will participate in the Transmississippi and International Exposition is likely to be increased by the addition of British Columbia.  A special commissioner of the exposition, J. F. Knapp, was sent into that province of Canada several days ago to endeavor to secure the active interest of the people of that section in the exposition, and a telegram from him, dated Victoria, B. C., received by the Department of Publicity and Promotion, indicates that prompt action has been taken in the matter.  The telegram was as follows: "British Columbia Board of Trade has taken favorable action with the provincial government.  The minister of mines has taken the matter up with Dr. Dawson of Ottawa, and West Kootenay district, and representation will be had."</p>

                            <p>Reports from Missouri are to the effect that the exhibit of that state will be much better than was anticipated.  The commission is still collecting money and is receiving contributions from all parts of the state.  The Horticultural society promises that its exhibit will excel that of California or any other state, the mines exhibit will be the largest ever made by the state and the agricultural exhibit will be excellent.  The women's exhibit is in charge of a committee of women, with Mrs. Scammon of Kansas City at the head, and it is said the exhibit will be an excellent one.  Chairman Sterrett of the commission expresses the conviction that the state exhibit will be a most creditable one.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Omaha is invaded today by an army of Exposition commissioners, two states and one territory being represented in the ranks.  Ohio from the east sends a full body of representative citizens, who are here to arrange for the Buckeye state's part in the great fair.  Oklahoma, the baby of the union, <choice><sic>isrepresented</sic><corr>is represented</corr></choice> by two of the territory's pushers, who will not return home until all its dealings with the exposition are complete.  Texas, the <choice><sic>mammonth</sic><corr>mammoth</corr></choice> empire of the southwest, has but a single representative, but he has full authority to make all arrangements for the state's participation.</p>
                            <p>The Ohio Exposition commission has come in a body to visit Omaha and see what has been done in the way of preparation for the exposition and to determine just what shall be done in the way of preparation for the exposition and to determine just what shall be done by the official representatives of the Buckeye state regarding state participation in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The commission comprises these members, all of whom are here:  Hon. Harry C. Mason of Cleveland, speaker of the house of representatives and chairman of the commission; Hon. S. B. Rankin of South Charleston, member of the lower house of the legislature; Senator H. E. Valentine of Bucyrus and Senator W. G. Brorein of Buckland.</p>
                            <p>The visitors arrived over the Wabash at noon and were met at Council Bluffs by Major Clarkson, who escorted them across the river and to the hotel.  Here they were entertained at luncheon by President Wattles, Major Clarkson, John L. Webster and Howard H. Baldrige.</p>
                            <p>Before going in to luncheon <choice><sic>Chariman</sic><corr>Chairman</corr></choice> Mason stated that absolutely nothing has been done by the commission in the way of preparation for an exhibit or in the way of preparation for an exhibit or in the way of official action of any kind.  He said the commission had come to Omaha in a body to look over the ground and see what the situation requires and to act accordingly.  The commission has an appropriation of $3,000 to cover its expenses but has no funds to use in the way of preparing exhibits.  Considerable interest has been taken in Ohio by number of the manufacturers and the duty of representing the state in this respect will be left to them.</p>
                            <p>The Ohio commission will probably remain in the city for a day or two.  It was the intention of the exposition management to escort the visitors to the exposition grounds, but the driving rain made such a course impracticable and this will be left until a later time.</p>

                            <p>J. C. Post of Kingfisher, chairman of the Oklahoma Exposition commission, and C. M. Points of Shawnee, a member of the commission, are in the city to make arrangements for space for the Oklahoma exhibit in the main buildings of the exposition.  They visited the grounds together and inspected the buildings and will complete all arrangements for the necessary space before returning home tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Post takes a great interest in the exposition largely on account of the fact that he was a resident of Nebraska for many years.  He is a brother of Judge A. M. Post of Columbus, and was associated with him in the banking business in York for several years, afterwards serving in the office of Lorenzo Crounse when the latter was collector of internal revenue for this district.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Post says Oklahoma will make a showing that will completely surprise people who are not familiar with the conditions prevailing in that section.  Displays will be made of agricultural and horticultural products and minerals, including coal, iron, building stone and oil.</p>
                            <p>"We are going to surprise everybody with our display," said Mr. Post with a confident smile.  "We will show all kinds of small fruits, including cherries, peaches, pears, etc.  Our oats and small grain will be ready to harvest in about ten or fifteen days, and we will make a specialty of fresh grain, which we will renew every few days and keep always fresh.  Our cotton we will handle the same way.  One feature of our display will be a big Indian tepee with a lot of relics, etc., intended to show the conditions in our territory nine years ago compared with the conditions that exist today.</p>
                            <p>"We have all the money we need," continued Mr. Post.  "We get some from the government and the railroads and private subscriptions make up a fund sufficient to meet all our necessities.  Before Mr. Points and I return home we will make all arrangements for our space and we will be here on time with our exhibit."</p>

                            <p>C. S. Penfield of Houston, Tex., chairman of the rejuvenated Texas Exposition commission, is in the city to close up all arrangements for the extensive exhibit of the resources of the Lone Star state which will be made by the new commission.  Mr. Penfield is a former resident of Nebraska, and takes a great interest in the success of the exposition and in the proper representation of his adopted state in the eyes of the world.  He says the state will have a magnificent exhibit of all the diversified resources of the largest state in the union, and the money is all in hand to carry out the projected arrangements.</p>
                            <p>The space reserved by Vice President Johnson for the Texas exhibit covers 2,8000 square feet, and Mr. Penfield is endeavoring to increase the amount.  The exhibit will include everything produced or found in the natural state in Texas, including fruits of all kinds, sugar, building stone, tobacco, wool, cotton, canaigre and tanning materials, fiber plants of all kinds, clays, kaolin, etc.  A very large part of this material is already in hand and this will be supplemented by new material of all kinds, making one of the most complete and extensive exhibits ever attempted by the state.  Mr. Penfield says the state has never made any very great display at former expositions, and the new commission is determined that the present occasion shall be a record-breaker and establish a precedent that cannot be excelled.</p>
                            <p>The people of Houston and the members of the San Antonio &amp; Aransas Pass Railway Immigration association have raised the money necessary to make this display after repeated failures on the part of the former commission to accomplish anything tangible and the great bulk of the exhibit will be such as is contributed by the southern part of Texas.</p>

There will also be two ambulance surgeons and as many assistant nurses as the necessity of the case may require.  These will not be appointed until the occasion for their employment arises.</p>
                            <p>The cottage on Twentieth street just north of the Administration building, will be utilized as offices, sleeping rooms for the attendants, etc., and an addition is being constructed which will be used for the hospital.

This will be an emergency hospital and patients will be kept there only so long as may be absolutely necessary.</p>

                            <p>Icilio Ninci, manager of the Streets of Cairo, has arrived in the city and will remain until the close of the exposition.  Immediately after reaching town Mr. Ninci visited the exposition grounds and spent several hours there, visiting the buildings and getting a general idea of the situation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ninci comes from Egypt, where he has been during the last few months, working up attractions and features for the concession of which he is the manager.  He is an Egyptian by birth, and has been in the show business since the World's fair.  At that great show he was manager of the Streets of Cairo.  Speaking of the Transmississippi Exposition, he said:  "It is going to be a great show, and will surpass any ever held, barring, of course, the World's fair.  In many respects, however, it will be better than that.  People are learning how to conduct expositions, and the work done at Omaha shows that the managers of this exposition have profited by the experience of others.</p>
                            <p>"Though smaller, the buildings at the Transmississippi Exposition, are better, more beautiful and better accommodated for a fine display than were those at Chicago.  The style of the buildings at Omaha is <choice><sic>supurb</sic><corr>superb</corr></choice> and everything indicates that it will be a magnificent exhibit.  People all over the country are talking about the exposition in this city and my judgment is that right from the start the crowds will be enormous.  The attendance ought to be double that at Atlanta, San Francisco or Nashville.</p>
                            <p>"Regarding the Streets of Cairo, everything will be new and clean.  Nothing will be exhibited here that has been seen before.  There will be any number of new features and on the whole I expect that we will have the most interesting exhibit on the grounds.  All of our people will be native Egyptians, who will come here direct from their native country.  They will

                            pursue their native arts and will conduct themselves the same as at home.  We will have the Egyptian theater, where the Egyptian dances and plays will be put on.  There will be the camels, the donkeys, the booths and the smoking parlors.  It is our purpose to make the concession an exact reproduction of one of the fashionable streets in an Egyptian city."</p>

                            <p>"It makes me laugh to hear people say that there will be few foreign exhibits at the exposition," declared Charles D. Woodworth, deputy surveyor of customs.  "We are receiving notice every day of consignments of stuff to the exposition, and their value runs up into thousands of dollars."</p>
                            <p>All the foreign exhibits must pass through the local office, but its labors will be greatly thrown upon the shoulders of James R. Dunn, deputy surveyor of customs.  Mr. Dunn has arrived in the city with his family and is quartered at the Millard.  He will find plenty of work on his hands.  He will keep a record of all exhibits received from foreign countries, and must check them up frequently during the exposition.  Whenever an article is missing&#8212;whether lost, stolen or sold&#8212;duty must be at once paid on it.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Inspection of the Buildings Followed by Luncheon, at Which Ideas Concerning the Press Are Exchanged.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The luncheon in honor of the visiting editors of the Elkhorn valley yesterday was presided over by President Wattles and seated on either side of him at the principal tables were General Manager Bidwell and General Passenger Agent Buchanan of the Elkhorn road, Manager Rosewater, Director Hitchcock and Prof. F. W. Taylor, representing the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion was the first speaker.  He indulged in a few personal remarks of a joking nature and then proceeded to express the lasting obligations of the exposition management to the press of the United States, and particularly to the newspapers of Nebraska, for the substantial support the exposition had received at the hands of the editors.  He asserted that this exposition is not a country fair or a state fair but a world's fair, in which the resources of the great transmississippi region are to be shown to the whole world.  Thirty-three states and four territories have officially recognized the exposition, and in bringing about this condition of affairs, Mr. Rosewater said, the country press might have been "sponged" on, but if so it had been done in the interest of Nebraska and the transmississippi region and not for the benefit of Omaha.  The country press had responded nobly to the calls made upon it, and Mr. Rosewater said the exposition intends to recognize the services rendered.  Regarding certain complaints which had been made to the effect that the country editors had been unable to learn how they were to be treated, he said this matter had only been definitely settled within the last few days and he proceeded to explain the plan that has been adopted in this connection.  A ticket will be issued to each editor of a paper which has favored the exposition.  This ticket will admit the editor and his wife and will be good during June, or, if the editor is unable to come to Omaha during that month, the ticket will be honored at any subsequent time during the entire time of the stay of the editor in the city.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">TRUTH WILL DO.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater suggested that when the editors return home after this brief visit to the exposition grounds they could truthfully say the Nebraska has done nobly and challenge the world to come and see what has been done.  It would be only necessary to tell the truth to convince people that a failure to come to the exposition would be a life-long subject of regret.</p>
                            <p>The speaker then entered upon a brief personal explanation of repeated charges which have been made from certain sources to the effect that The Omaha Bee is being paid for space.  He briefly related the main points regarding the special illustrated edition of The Weekly Bee, which is to be issued next week, an issue of 200,000, with a four-page supplement on heavy paper and copiously illustrated, for which The Bee is to be paid $3,200 in exposition stock.  He said he was in favor of giving the World-Herald the same privilege on exactly the same terms.</p>
                            <p>In closing Mr. Rosewater said the Department of Publicity greatly appreciates the help of the country press and intends to do everything possible for the benefit of the editors of the newspapers of the state.</p>
                            <p>General Manager Bidwell was the next speaker and spoke briefly regarding the power of the state press.  He said it was the best medium through which those interested in the progress of the state could best bring about that object and he referred to the success of the exposition as a result brought about, largely, through the support given the movement by the newspapers.  He then spoke of the great resources of the state and how these may be developed by concerted effort on the part of all concerned.</p>
                            <p>G. M. Hitchcock was next introduced and he spoke quite briefly regarding the importance of the exposition to the interests of the state and the energetic support which had been given the enterprise by the press of the state.</p>
                            <p>F. G. Simmons of Seward was called on for a talk on behalf of the guests of the occasion.  He briefly expressed the thanks of those present for the magnificent manner in which they had been entertained, and said that every newspaper man in the state is thoroughly interested in the success of the exposition.  Regarding the proposed plan of providing for the accommodation of visiting editors Mr. Simmons had something to say.  He said he was a member of the executive committee of the press association of the state and as much had been instrumental in preparing a plan which embodied the views of the committee and, he believed, of the state association, regarding the courtesies to which the editors of the state are entitled for their support of the exposition.  He said the editors expect to pay for everything they receive and do not regard free admissions as favors.  The plan outlined by Manager Rosewater, he said, did not meet with his approval, and he did not believe it would be satisfactory to the other members of the committee or to many of the association.  He said he thought the plan presented by the press executive committee would be much more acceptable.  Mr. Simmons warned the exposition management that there are many editors in the state who are simply waiting an opportunity to stick a knife into the vitals of the exposition if the opportunity offers, and he said the plan now proposed would simply afford this opportunity.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PASSES FOR EDITORS.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles said in reply to the remarks of Mr. Simmons that the exposition expects to grant everything within reason to the editors of the country press, and he said the least that could be done would be to give to the editor of every paper which helps the exposition free admission for himself and wife at any time they may choose to come to the exposition.  Before taking his seat Mr. Wattles read a letter from Governor Holcomb regarding the proclamation he will soon issue making June 1 a state holiday in honor of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>G. F. Kenower of Wisner and General Passenger Agent Buchanan made a few brief remarks and the assemblage dispersed, the majority of the visitors taking the 3 o'clock train for their homes, General Manager Bidwell having held the train twenty minutes for their accommodation.</p>

                            <p>The list of foreign states which will participate in the Transmississippi and International Exposition is likely to be increased by the addition of British Columbia.  A special commissioner of the exposition, J. F. Knapp, was sent into that province of Canada several days ago to endeavor to secure the active interest of the people of that section in the exposition, and a telegram from him, dated Victoria, B. C., received by the Department of Publicity and Promotion, indicates that prompt action has been taken in the matter.  The telegram was as follows: "British Columbia Board of Trade has taken favorable action with the provincial government.  The minister of mines has taken the matter up with Dr. Dawson of Ottawa, and West Kootenay district, and representation will be had."</p>

                            <p>Three score and ten Nebraska and South Dakota editors arrived in the city Monday evening.  All live at points along the Elkhorn road and it was upon invitation of officials of that road that they are enjoying their visit to Omaha and the exposition..  Monday evening no program had been arranged but the editors succeeded in enjoying themselves thoroughly.  Most of them attended the theaters and made their presence felt by a dignity that was almost audible.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday they <choice><sic>viscited</sic><corr>visited</corr></choice> the exposition grounds, going out in special street railway trains.  At 1 o'clock sharp they returned and seated themselves around the banquet board at the Mercer hotel.  Addresses were delivered by G. W. Wattles, G. M. Hitchcock, Ross Hammond of Fremont and W. N. Hughes of Norfolk.  Late in the afternoon the newspaper men left on the Elkhorn for their homes.</p>

                            <p>The speech making following the banquet was introduced by President Wattles, who complimented the state press in causing for the most part the success so far of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The chief feature of the address of Mr. Rosewater was his explanation of the $3,200 deal.  He gave the same explanation that has appeared several times in his paper, and was profuse in expressions of his love for the country editors.  His remarks were received with a silence that was almost freezing.  To reward the editors for the space they had given to the exposition they were to be allowed to come to the show free with their wives during the month of July or at any other period.  In conclusion, he challenged "the gentlemen across the table," (Mr. Hitchcock, to print an edition such as the Bee intended to as its exposition supplement for the same amount of money.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock was on the program, but before he was called on Rosewater had retired.  Mr. Hitchcock was sure, he said, that the president in speaking of the editors of the great state of Nebraska, meant the great editors of the state of Nebraska, and in reply to the remarks of Rosewater, which all thought much out of place under the circumstances, he told a story of the early days of Grant's campaigns.  At one time there was a stampeded of mules from the army while in action, but the mules, instead of stampeding to the rear, stampeded to the front, and the enemy, thinking a cavalry charge was on hand fled precipitately, the result being a union victory.  After the event union officers agreed that the mules should be brevetted horses.  "Now," said Mr. Hitchcock, "I am perfectly willing that the manager of the department of publicity and promotion should be brevetted as a horse."</p>
                            <p>The applause which followed was vigorous and prolonged, and when Mr. Hitchcock reached for a toothpick it broke out again for as long a time.</p>

                            <p>George F. Bidwell, general manager of the Elkhorn, made a short talk emphasizing the opportunity which Nebraska had of showing up the great agricultural resources of the state.</p>
                            <p>Passenger Agent Buchanan confessed that at first he thought the exposition too big an enterprise for the city and the state to undertake, but now that it was so splendidly under way he urged that all should united to make it a great success.</p>
                            <p>F. G. Simmons of the Seward Reporter said that the executive committee of the Nebraska Press association was not quite satisfied that the members should be asked to come here in the month of June when the show was only in its incipiency and then go home and write laudatory articles about it.  The state editors had done everything so far in advertising the exposition without thought of recompense, and now that they were being considered, he insisted that they should be allowed to come at any time and as often as they wished.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles gave assurance that the newspaper men should have no cause for complaint, and his statement was greeted by cheers.</p>
                            <p>The speech making closed with a pleasant address by G. F. Kenower of Wisner.</p>

                            <p>The exposition executive committee has decided what it will do in the way of admitting representatives of the press to the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the department of publicity and promotion presented the following classes of newspapers to whom press passes should be issued, as follows:</p>

Estimated number of weeklies in this class is 3,100.</p>
                            <p>Class 2.&#8212;Weeklies in Trans-Mississippi states, not included in first class, to receive a pass for each editor and wife, good during June, inclosed with circular stating that a pass for five days will be furnished to editors who have not made use of the term passes, upon surrender of same to the bureau of admissions.</p>
                            <p>Conditions&#8212;The department of publicity and promotion will by letter advise each editor in this class of the above provision and inclose to him a requisition on the bureau of admissions for said passes; said editors to fill out said requisition blank, giving his name in full with that of his wife's name, and location of paper they represent and the time at which they will visit the exposition, to enable the admissions bureau to send passes for the five days on which said editors plan to visit the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Class 3.&#8212;Weeklies outside of Trans-Mississippi territory, pass good for three days in June, exchangeable for single trip pass under conditions named in class 1.  Conditions, same as condition under class 2.</p>
                            <p>Class 4.&#8212;Dailies in cities of less than 50,000, pass for editor and wife, good for ten days at any period during the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Condition&#8212;Same as conditions under class 2.</p>
                            <p>Class 5.&#8212;Dailies in cities of over 50,000 population, pass for editor-in-chief and wife and managing editor and wife, good during the period of the exposition.  This class shall also include first-class magazines and weeklies of over 50,000 circulation.</p>

                            <p>All trip passes on account of the press will be issued by department of publicity and promotion.</p>
                            <p>The above was discussed at length, and the following resolution was adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That department of publicity and promotion submit to the executive committee names of newspapers, their publishers or editor, included in the above various classification, and that bureau of admissions be directed to issue passes on order of the executive committee, as per said list.</p>
                            <p>Later the rules were amended by the addition of the following:</p>
                            <p>Class 6.&#8212;For each daily in the territory enumerated class 1, pass for editor and wife good during the entire exposition.</p>

Brigham, who is secretary to his father, the president of the government board of control, have reached the city and will remain until the exposition is over.  Mr. Wilson is the son of the secretary of agriculture.  He and Mr. Brigham have taken quarters at the Merriam.</p>
                            <p>Captain Cox will take charge of the Government building and the general exhibit until the arrival of the full board, which will probably be about the middle of May.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the big Government building looks like a warehouse, all sorts of packed and unpacked freight being piled in there.  Some progress is being made in arranging the exhibits, and Decorator Morrey yesterday morning began work on the interior of the dome.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Neglect in Not Providing for Ample Representation at the Great Fair May Be Partially Compensated by Hard Work.</head>
                            <p>The Ohio Exposition commission visited the exposition grounds in a body this morning under the escort of Major Clarkson.  The commissioners had been prepared in a measure for what would be shown them, the afternoon of yesterday having been spent with some of the exposition officials in discussing what had been done and the general situation, but when they reached the grounds they were astounded as the substantial evidence on every hand of what the people of Nebraska and Omaha have done to provide a home for the exposition of the resources of the great west.  They expressed themselves in terms of warmest enthusiasm regarding the enterprise and energy shown by the preparations under way and regretted that the legislature of which all are members had not made a substantial appropriation for a state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The members of the commission said they would determine upon some course of action before leaving Omaha.  They will remain until 5:10 p. m. Friday and the intervening time will be spent by them in becoming thoroughly familiar with the full details and deciding upon what shall be done for and by their state.  In discussing this matter the commissioners stated that the manufacturers of Ohio have already taken a substantial interest in the exposition and are preparing to make exhibits.  With the small appropriation available&#8212;$2,000&#8212;the commissioners doubted if any attempt would be made at a state exhibit, but would determine that point finally before leaving for home.</p>

                            <p>Messrs. Post and Points, the Oklahoma commissioners, are still considering the matter of Oklahoma's exhibit at the exposition and are negotiating with the Department of Exhibits for space.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Post left at exposition headquarters a few samples of what the youngest territory in the union may be expected to do in an agricultural and horticultural line.  These samples included a bunch of alfalfa, roots and all, pulled out of a field near Kingfisher, belonging to President Low of the Rock Island railway.  The alfalfa was fresh and green and had reached a height of thirteen inches.  Numerous samples from the farm of W. F. Bort, a big land owner near Kingfisher, <choice><sic>in cluded</sic><corr>included</corr></choice> red turkey wheat twenty-six inches in height, with the heads beginning to ripen; branches cut from cherry and peach trees laden with young fruit, the cherries as large as good sized peas and the peaches half an inch long and three-eighths of an inch in diameter.  Strawberries nearly ripe enough to eat, apples in the stage so dear to the heart of the small boy were among the lot and the quantity of fruit on the branches in each case indicated an enormous crop of all the varieties named.  Mr. Post said he had gathered these specimens as he was about to take the train and that they were only moderate illustrations of the showing the young territory would make when the exposition opens.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Uncle Sam's Great Floating Fortresses to Be Shown in Miniature.</head>
                            <p>Three cars containing material for the exhibit of the Navy department in the Government building have arrived and are being unloaded at the exposition grounds.  Two more cars will arrive within the next few days with the balance of the material.  The Navy department exhibit will occupy the northeast corner of the Government building opposite the exhibit of the Fish commission, and it promises to be one of the most interesting of the many interesting displays to be made by all of the federal departments.  First Lieutenant S. J. Logan of the United States Marine corps, a brother of Lieutenant Commander L. C. Logan, the representative of the Navy department, will have charge of the installation of the exhibit and will probably remain in charge of it during the exposition.  He has arrived in the city and has taken up the work of getting the material in place.  E. H. Behnke of the Navy department, an expert in exposition work, is the foreman in charge of the handling of the materials constituting the exhibit.</p>
                            <p>A prominent feature of the exhibit of the Navy department, and one which promises to attract great attention, in view of the overwhelming interest in everything pertaining to naval matters, is the display of the models of battleships and naval vessels of all classes.  There will be twenty-four of these models, representing nearly every class of modern war vessels.  They are from six to twelve feet in length, according to the size of <choice><sic>thes hip</sic><corr>the ship</corr></choice> itself, and each is complete in the most minute details.  The full list of the models which will comprise this section of the Navy department display includes the following vessels:  Maine, Iowa, Illinois, the old Kearsarge, Baltimore, Annapolis, Charleston, New York, Massachusetts, Columbia, Kathadin, Vesuvius, Newark, Miantonomoh, Nashville, Petrel, Texas, Atlanta, Wheeling, Yorktown, Monterey, two gunboats, Nos. 8 and 9 respectively, and the Bancroft, the training ship of the Annapolis academy.</p>
                            <p>In connection with this exhibit of ships' models will be shown a model of a dry dock.  This dock will be erected in a large tank containing water and the Illinois, one of the battleships, will be "docked" in regulation style two or three times each day, showing the exact operation of this very interesting proceeding.</p>
                            <p>Two things in the Navy exhibit which will be of peculiar interest to the people of this section are the ship's bell and the figurehead of the good old ship Omaha.  These have been secured especially for this exhibit and will probably attract a great deal of attention.</p>
                            <p>A huge anchor, such as are used on the largest battleships, will also be in the display and there will be guns of all sizes and kinds, including the latest pattern of quick-firing guns.</p>

The tanks have been kept filled with water for the last week and all are perfectly tight and in first class shape.  The 18,000 gallons of sea water which will be used for the tanks in which the ocean fish are to be displayed is on the way to Omaha and will arrive here about May 15.  The ocean fish will <choice><sic>arive</sic><corr>arrive</corr></choice> about the 20th inst., and will be at once introduced to their new home.  The fresh water fish will arrive shortly afterwards.  These will be brought from the government hatcheries at Leadville, Col.; Quincy, Ill., and Manchester, Ia.</p>
                            <p>W. P. Sauerhoff, the expert in the fish culture section, and W. E. Morgan, an assistant in the department, have arrived.  Mr. Sauerhoff will have charge of the hatchery portion of the fish exhibit and will have it in full operation.  He is credited with being able to extract a greater number of fry from a given amount of spawn than any man who ever attempted that delicate operation.</p>

Beck was granted a concession for the operation of a number of novel nickel-in-the-slot machines, the machine being known as the automatic cackling hen, a nickel placed in the repository causing the hen to cackle and lay an egg containing merchandise of various kinds.</p>
                            <p>Smith &amp; Eastman were awarded the contract for making sixty-two small vases at $2 each, and two large vases at $35 each, these to be used about the grounds as a part of the embellishment.</p>

                            <p>E. A. Crane, the architect who designed the Government building, has arrived in the city for the purpose of passing on the building before its final acceptance from the contractors.  He will remain in the city a few days and <choice><sic>wil lgo</sic><corr>will go</corr></choice> over the building carefully with a view of determining whether the construction complies with his ideas.  Mr. Crane has received a great many high compliments since his arrival on the great beauty of the Government building.  Those who have seen the buildings erected by the government at previous expositions unhesitatingly pronounce the Omaha building by far the handsomest and most artistic structure that has ever been erected by the government for this purpose.  After a casual survey of the building Mr. Crane expressed himself as greatly pleased with the manner in which the building had been constructed.</p>

                            <p>The Washington Exposition commission and the Chamber of Commerce of Seattle have combined their forces in the matter of making an exhibit at the exposition and in the erection of a state building.  It is the intention of the commission to erect a state building 100 feet square and the lumber men of the state are making donations of the necessary lumber.  The people of Spokane have already raised $5,000 for the state commission and the members of the commission are confident that a display will be made on a large scale.  The commission estimates that about $10,000 will be required to make an exhibit which will be complete in every respect and little difficulty is anticipated in raising this amount.</p>

                            <p>COLUMBUS, Neb., May 4.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;W. G. Truitt of Grand Island is in the city and has on exhibition a bird called an ibis, which he intends taking to Omaha to the exposition.  The bird weighs forty pounds and measures almost ten feet from tip to tip of wings.  His beak or bill is eighteen inches long.  The plumage is snow white, except the extreme tip of the wings, and it has monstrous large, red-webbed feet.  It was captured on the Yukon river in Alaska last year, but that climate is not its home.  Mr. Truitt has experimented some with the bird and finds that it cannot rise and fly from the ground, but can easily do so from the water.  The bird varies slightly from Webster's description of the ibis, but is probably a species of that family.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">WHAT EDITORS WILL GET.</hi></head>
                            <p>At the editorial banquet in Omaha Tuesday Manager Rosewater's plans for rewarding the generosity of the press were made public, having been adopted by the executive committee.  The rule provides for giving weekly papers in the transmississippi states, who have favored the exposition, a pass for the publisher and his wife good until June 30, and makes the following liberal apportionment to daily papers such as the Press:  "Dailies in cities of less than 50,000, pass for an editor and wife, good for ten days at any period during the exposition."</p>
                            <p>Ye Gods!  How can such generosity be accounted for.  Just think of it, a pass good for ten days to pay for probably $500 worth of advertising space.</p>
                            <p>Gall!  Well, we say yes, and intend heading the list of publishers who will refuse such a liberal gift and should we desire to be roped in by the Rosewater exposition, we will pay 50 cents for that privilege.</p>
                            <p>Is this great exposition to exceed that of the World's fair at Chicago in 1893?  We think not, and the management of that, the greatest of expositions in the world's history, paid for their advertising space and did not want the earth.  All publishers were treated alike.&#8212;Nebraska City Press.</p>
                            <p>This is a sample brick of the missiles thrown at the exposition at the instigation of the Omaha World-Herald.  Had the editor of the Nebraska City Press been present at the banquet to which he refers he would not have made such a flagrant misstatement.  The rules adopted by the exposition management for press privileges were not made public at that gathering, but were given out in a distorted and garbled form through the local yellow kid fakery, which is exerting itself to the utmost to create a feeling to hostility to the exposition in every possible way.</p>
                            <p>In order that further misrepresentation shall cease The Bee presents the correct version of the rules governing the issue of editorial passes to Nebraska papers.</p>
                            <p>1.  Each weekly paper that has favored the exposition with advertising will be furnished with one pass for the publisher or editor and another for his wife or accompanying lady, good during the month of June, and, if not used during that month, exchangeable for term passes during the period when the editor and his lady may be in attendance upon the exposition.</p>
                            <p>2.  The editor of every Nebraska daily that has advertised the exposition will be furnished with a pass for himself and wife, good during the entire exposition.</p>
                            <p>The same ranks will apply to editors in the states of Iowa, Kansas, Colorado, South Dakota, Wyoming, Southern Minnesota and Northern Missouri.  Editors of papers in cities under 50,000 population outside of the territory named will receive passes good for ten days at any time during the exposition, and those in cities of 50,000 and over will be on the same plane as those of Nebraska, with the addition of passes for their managing editors.</p>
                            <p>This is the most liberal treatment the press has ever received at the hands of any great exposition and nobody has taken exceptions to it except those who are seeking a pretext for knifing the exposition.  The sandbaggers, however, may rest assured that the exposition has reached the stage and magnitude that places it out of the reach of harm from their paper pellets.</p>
                            <p>Incidentally and for the benefit of the disgruntled The Bee most emphatically contradicts the assertion that all publishers and editors were treated alike at the World's fair, or that the World's fair paid newspaper publishers for advertising space.  It is notorious that the weeklies, even of Illinois, failed to receive recognition at the World's fair and the smaller dailies had to content themselves with trip passes secured after laborious importuning.  The same is true in great measure of the expositions at San Francisco, Atlanta and Nashville.  Editors of the transmississippi region <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>At the call of seventeen directors a special meeting of the board of directors of the exposition was held yesterday afternoon for the purpose of considering the matter of the appointment of a director general for the enterprise.  Although the call for the meeting was not filed with Secretary Wakefield until 12:30 p. m. yesterday, and telephonic notice of the meeting did not reach some of the directors until after 3 o'clock, such was the general interest in the vital question to be presented for consideration that twenty-seven directors were present when the roll was called.</p>
                            <p>The call for the meeting was as follows: "A special meeting of the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition is hereby called on Friday, May 6, at 4 p. m., at the offices of said exposition, Paxton building, to take action relative to the appointment of a director general."  It was signed by Alvin Saunders, A. C. Smith, C. E. Yost, G. H. Payne, John C. Wharton, Henry A. Thompson, Thomas Kilpatrick, C. F. Weller, E. Dickinson, George F. Bidwell, E. W. Lee, R. S. Wilcox, Frank Murphy, L. H. Korty, E. C. Price, F. M. Youngs and C. W. Lyman.</p>
                            <p>Before the call for the meeting was read the president directed the secretary to read a communication which was handed him.  This proved to be a letter from General Manderson, withdrawing the resignation as a director tendered by him at the last meeting of the board.  This action of General Manderson was taken at the urgent solicitation of a number of the most influential directors and the reading of the communication was greeted with hearty applause and expressions of approval.</p>
                            <p>The call for the special meeting was then read and the president asked for the further pleasure of the meeting.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery was the first one on his feet and he said he was opposed to any undue haste on the part of the board, saying that it would be unwise to take hasty action on a matter of such great importance.  He urged the shortness of the notice as a reason why the meeting should adjourn to some future time, in order that a full attendance of the board might be obtained and the matter given careful consideration.  He closed by moving an adjournment until Monday next at 4 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Yost suggested that the executive committee should present a plan for the centralization of power in one man or say that they do not want such a plan, and he amended the motion to provide that when the board meets Monday the committee shall present a report on these lines.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Discuss the Subject.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said the board had already to unload too much of its own responsibility on the executive committee and he urged that the matter be discussed informally, in order that it may be better understood when the board meets on Monday.</p>
                            <p>This idea prevailed and the members of the executive committee who were present were called on to express their views, Managers Lindsey, Bruce and Rosewater being the only ones present.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lindsey said the executive committee had been told continually that it was doing well; if it should be proposed to now place all the power in one man's hands he would oppose it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bruce said he had been serving twenty-one months to the best of his ability and if he had failed the board was responsibly for electing him on the executive committee.  He said he did not want any assistance except that of his co-workers of the last twenty-one months.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson said the matter under consideration was one of grave import and should be decided only after due consideration and a full attendance of members of the board.  He said there was another matter which should also receive careful consideration&#8212;the question of cash premiums for live stock exhibits.  He referred briefly to the importance of the live stock industry to this section of the country and then turned again to the matter of a director general.  He said the question was one which would not down.  The board thought it had settled the matter some months ago, but it did not seem to be any nearer a solution<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>He complimented the executive committee on the efficient manner in which a thankless task had been accomplished, but there now seemed to be a great difference of opinion in the executive committee with reference to the necessity for a director general.  He said he thought it was about time the matter was brought before the whole board and each member of the committee called upon to give the reasons for his position.  He said that he did not desire to oust the members of the committee or to curtail their powers in any way, but he simply desired to relieve the committee of the burdens imposed on it and to make a more symmetrical organization.  He called attention to the fact that the representatives of the people who will be here to see the exposition are now on the ground and more are coming every day and he deprecated the necessity of furnishing these people with grounds for reports that the exposition management is wrangling.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Goes Over Until Monday.</head>
                            <p>General Manderson said he would have a poor opinion of a member of the executive committee who would resign in case the board decided that a director general is necessary.  He had heard several statements of that kind, he said, but hoped they were not true.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion General Manderson insisted that the executive committee should formulate some plan for enlarging the powers of General Superintendent Foster, if he should be decided to be the man to be vested with more power.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said there had been no contention in the executive committee regarding the appointment of a director general and no proposition to appoint one.  He reviewed the events preceding the appointment of Mr. Foster as general superintendent and said that since that appointment there seemed to have been a combination to curtail his powers as much as possible.  This had been carried so far that Foster was a mere figurehead, without a shadow of authority in any department.  This state of affairs had forced the conviction that this could not continue during the exposition.  "If Foster is not competent to fulfill enlarged duties he should be dismissed," said Mr. Rosewater, "but the present state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue without seriously menacing the exposition.  Already there are three different departments on the grounds and soon there will be five.  The employes of each of these departments are supreme and the result is a conflict of authority which is causing trouble and delay."  The speaker detailed a number of circumstances showing the practical operation of such organization and declared that the only solution was to have some one in general power.  This officer should have control, under the executive committee, over all the men on the grounds.  Mr. Rosewater declared that no business could be conducted successfully without an executive head and such an officer in a business house or a railroad or any other great business does not abrogate the powers of the officers or directors.</p>
                            <p>A desultory discussion followed these statements of the situation, the consensus of opinion being that the time had arrived for the concentration of authority and responsibility in one man who is to direct and supervise affairs of all the departments represented by subordinates on the grounds and the motion to adjourn until Monday afternoon was then carried without a dissenting voice.</p>

                            <p>Active work has been commenced on the booths for the Nebraska educational exhibit and the manner in which the work is laid out gives assurance that in setting and extent, at least, the Nebraska exhibit will be a memorable one.  The exhibit will occupy all the north and east sides of the gallery of the big Manufactures building and the east half of the south gallery.  The gallery is thirty feet in width all around and this space will be divided in such a way that a long series of rooms will extend through the middle of the portion to be occupied by this exhibit.  This long room will be eighteen feet in width and an aisle six feet in width will extend along the sides of the room.  The long space thus enclosed will be subdivided into rooms sixteen feet in width by short walls extending out from either side, these short walls forming a passageway ten feet in width entirely through the enclosure.</p>

                            <p>The walls forming this series of small rooms will be thirteen feet in height and on these will be displayed the cardboards to which will be attached the specimens of school work.  The wall next to the gallery railing will be elaborately decorated with flags and bunting above a point seven feet from the floor.  The section of the exhibit booth directly opposite the main entrance to the building will be in the form of a series of arches rising above the height of the other portions of the wall and on these arches will be the name of the exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The central portion of the east gallery will be devoted to the exhibit to be made by the University of Nebraska and this is marked by a series of arches similar to those heretofore referred to, but on a more modified scale.</p>
                            <p>The erection of these booths is in charge of Prof. C. W. Stuart, assistant to State Superintendent Jackson.  He has four men employed and every effort is being made to push the work to completion before the exhibits begin to arrive in large numbers.  The exhibit of the Lincoln Normal university was the first to arrive, having been received early in the week, but the great bulk of the material is not wanted before the 10th inst., by which time it is expected that the booths will be ready for mounting the exhibits.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sorry that the State Legislature Made No Appropriation.</head>
                            <p>The four members of the Ohio Exposition commission who spent the greater part of three days in Omaha looking into exposition matters returned home yesterday afternoon.  Before leaving the commissioners, one and all, assured the officers of the exposition that they intend doing everything in their power to atone for the great delay on the part of their state and for the lack of an appropriation.  They continually expressed regret that the great importance of the exposition had not been fully appreciated by the legislature before adjournment, as an appropriation sufficient for a fine exhibit might have been secured without difficulty.  In the absence of any appropriation the commissioners announced their intention of interesting the state officers and the numerous state institutions in the matter of making an exhibit of an educational and historical nature.  The State university, of which Chancellor Canfield, formerly of the University of Nebraska, is the head, was thought to be an excellent starting point, and the commissioners expressed great confidence in their ability to collect an exhibit such as they named which would be an attractive display.</p>
                            <p>The Ohio club, which was recently formed in this city, is considering plans for the erection of a clubhouse on the exposition grounds and if this project is successful the Ohio commission will make its exhibit in this building.  In case the movement does not succeed the commission will engage space in the gallery of the Manufactures building for the display.</p>

                            <p>Eleven members of the Illinois Exposition commission are in the city, having come for the purpose of looking over the Illinois building, now almost completed, and making such further arrangements for the arrangement of the building and for the exhibits, which will be made under the direction of the commission, as may be necessary.</p>
                            <p>Those constituting the party are Chairman W. H. Harper of the executive committee and Commissioners F. W. Peck, C. I. Peck, C. H. Gould, Hall T. McCormick, C. C. Williams, H. R. Wilson, J. R. Key and C. A. Malbry, all of Chicago; C. H. Keeler of Dixon and W. B. Brinton of Peru.</p>
                            <p>The party went to the exposition grounds with Major Clarkson and took great pleasure in inspecting the progress which has been made in all parts of the of the grounds.  The beauty of the nearly completed grounds was seen to the best advantage under the bright morning sun, and the visitors expressed themselves as being delighted with the impressive sight.</p>

                            <p>General Manderson struck the keynote of the exposition situation when he declared at the meeting of the board of directors that the appointment of a director general, like Banquo's ghost, will not down.  The imperative necessity of a supreme head to supervise and manage the active operations of the exposition must be patent to every business man who has ever had anything to do with handling large numbers of employes.</p>
                            <p>As the exposition is now organized there is bound to be clashing of authority and constant confusion that must work injury to the enterprise.  Within a few days there will be salaried employes and subordinate officials on the ground deriving their authority from five different department heads.  For example, the gatekeepers are to be under orders of the manager of the Ways and Means department, while the watchmen and guards will look for orders to the head of the Department of Grounds and Buildings.  The janitors inside of the buildings are to be appointed by and under control of the Department of Exhibits and so are the men engaged in the work of installation.  The janitors outside of the exposition buildings are to be employed under and directed by the Department of Grounds and Buildings.  The inspectors of the amusement section are to be appointed by and under orders of the Department of Concessions, while the ticket sellers, counters, cashiers and collectors of concession percentages are to be under the Department of Ways and Means.  The porters and guides are to come under the direction of the manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, while those employed in the bonded warehouse and freight storehouse are to be under the manager of the Department of Transportation.</p>

                            <p>"Veteran Soldiers' Week" will be one of the epochs in connection with the exposition.  A joint meeting of committees appointed by the exposition and the state department of the Grand Army of the Republic has decided that a week shall be set aside when the old soldiers of both armies shall be given the right of way.  The committees which have had this matter in charge are these:  For the Grand Army of the Republic, B. R. Ball, S. K. Spalding and John H. Butler; for the exposition, Captain H. E. Palmer, C. E. Adams of Superior and Major T. S. Clarkson.</p>
                            <p>The exact date for this gathering of the heroes of the late unpleasantness has not been determined, it having been decided to fix a date when President McKinley will be in Omaha.  When this date is learned the whole of that week will be designated as Old Soldiers' week and it is expected that thousands of the veterans will come to Omaha to visit the exposition and participate in the campfires and gatherings characteristic of the veterans.  Reports have already been received from distant points of whole families who intend to drive to Omaha and camp in the neighborhood of the exposition in order to save railroad fare and hotel bills.</p>
                            <p>The only free accommodations which will be provided in connection with the coming of the old soldiers will be a piece of ground suitable for camping, where those who drive to town can pitch their tents and enjoy themselves to their hearts' content.</p>

                            <head type="sub">World's Fair Expert Pays His First Visit to the Transmississippi and Admits His Surprise and Pleasure at the Experience.</head>
                            <p>All the members of the Illinois commission who were in Omaha yesterday had seen the exposition, with the exception of Ferdinand W. Peck and R. Hall McCormick of Chicago and these two men expressed great surprise at its size and beauty.  As vice president of the Columbian exposition and a member of the Illinois commission of the Atlanta and Nashville expositions, Mr. Peck has perhaps had more experience with expositions than any man in America.  Of the Transmississippi he said:  "When I stood in the main court I imagined I was in the Court of Honor again.  All that was different was the Government building where the Peristyle belonged.  The effect is magnificent and the buildings are as beautiful as those in Chicago and are far more nearly completed than our buildings were this long before the opening.  Until I saw the buildings and grounds I had no adequate conception of the grand scale the exposition was being made on.  I supposed it would be something like the Atlanta or Nashville expositions and was amazed to see how much larger it is."</p>
                            <p>In speaking of the Illinois commission Mr. Peck said that all the members were delighted with the exposition and particularly with the Illinois building and its admirable location.  "We expect to do all in our power to advertise the exposition and assist the management," said Mr. Peck.</p>
                            <p>A feature of the exposition which pleased Mr. Peck particularly was its accessibility to the main portion of the city, being not more than fifteen minutes' ride from down town.  He also remarked about the compactness of the main buildings and the ease with which they may be visited.</p>
                            <p>Mr. McCormack said of the Illinois building:  "I stood on the rear portico of the building and imagined I was looking out over the Garden of Eden.  The location of the building is magnificent, overlooking as it does the river and surrounding country on one side and adjoining the Grand Plaza.  It was fortunate that members of the commission were on the ground early and selected such a desirable spot."</p>
                            <p>The "Midway," in Mr. Peck's opinion, will be a great drawing card and he says it is the first thing that Chicago people inquire about.  He further says that he thinks it is unwise to try to give any other name to the amusement section than "Midway,' 'because the name has come to be synonymous with what people are anxious to see in the amusement <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Both Mr. Peck and Mr. McCormick think that the pictures of the exposition which have been sent out are entirely inadequate to show its beauty and in fact do not think any lithograph can do it justice.  Mr. Peck says that the Columbian management found that photographs advertised the Chicago exposition in a better manner than any other kind of picture, and suggests that the Transmississippi directors have photographs of the main buildings and grounds placed in prominent places in large cities.</p>

                            <p>The Illinois building was thoroughly inspected and accepted from the contractor.  Arrangements were made for certain details in the interior furnishing of the building.  The members expressed themselves as greatly pleased with the handsome appearance of the building.</p>
                            <p>After returning down town a conference was held between the Illinois commissioners and representatives of the exposition and the date for "Illinois day" was decided upon.  This was the first of the state days to be definitely fixed, and June 21 was the date selected.  The visitors were enthusiastic over the unquestioned success of the exposition and insisted on a day for Illinois being fixed early in the season.  They solemnly promised that on "Illinois day" every resident of Illinois will be brought to Omaha and the entire vicinity of Omaha will be colored a deep vermillion hue.  The commissioners said that the interest in the exposition throughout Illinois is nothing short of tremendous and they predict with great confidence that the crowds which will visit Omaha on Illinois day will be immense.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Bureau of Public Comfort Organized and in Working Order.</head>
                            <p>An arrangement has been made between the exposition management and the Bureau of Information whereby the latter is to be the official representative of the exposition in the matter of providing accommodations for visitors to Omaha during the exposition, and the Bureau of Public Comfort has been abolished.</p>
                            <p>According to the terms of the contract which was consummated yesterday between the exposition and the Bureau of Information, and for the performance of which a bond of $5,000 was filed, with Dalton Risley and H. H. Baldrige as sureties, the exposition agrees to abandon the Bureau of Public Comfort forthwith and the Bureau of Information becomes the official medium through which visitors to Omaha will be supplied with rooms or lodging without expense to them, and a place will be provided for the handling of baggage, the checking of parcels, etc., a moderate charge to be made for the latter service.</p>
                            <p>By the terms of the contract the Bureau of Information agrees to maintain a headquarters at 1319 Farnam street and to keep on file there all the information obtainable regarding rooms in all parts of the city, with rates and such other information as may be desirable.  Information regarding these matters will be furnished to visitors without cost and they will be given full information how to reach the place selected.  The revenue of the bureau will be derived from a charge paid by the persons having rooms to rent or meals to furnish.  This charge will be 25 cents for each lodger remaining one night or 50 cents per lodger for any period extending over one night.  The bureau will endeavor to have all charges for rooms as moderate as possible.</p>
                            <p>Regarding storage for parcels or baggage, the bureau will charge 10 cents for parcels or baggage for each twenty-four hours or fraction thereof and will allow any express company or individual to deliver or remove the same.</p>
                            <p>The Bureau of Information also agrees to keep a complete list of all first-class hotels and boarding houses at its headquarters for inspection.  It will also maintain a uniformed agent at each railway depot at the time of arrival of trains to give information to strangers and patrons of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>An office of the bureau will be maintained on the exposition grounds at a place to be supplied by the exposition management.</p>
                            <p>The accounts of the Bureau of Information are to be open at all times to the inspection of the exposition management, and it is agreed that the bureau will not attempt to interfere in any way with the Transportation department in arranging for the accommodation of excursion parties.</p>

                            <head type="sub">National Congress of Mothers Comes to Exposition City.</head>
                            <p>Mrs. Harriet Heller, the Omaha delegate to the National Congress of Mothers at Washington, has written to the congress committee of the Woman's Board of Managers to the effect that the invitation to the congress to hold a special session at Omaha during the exposition met with favorable response and a successful meeting of the congress here is assured.  The national congress always meets in Washington, but the mission of Mrs. Heller was to induce the congress to realize that a meeting must be held in the west if it is expected that the organization spread in this section.</p>
                            <p>The members of the executive committee and the congress committee are in high feather over this latest success, as the congress of mothers is regarded as one of the leading organizations of women in this country.  Subjects of interest to women, pertaining to the home, the instruction of children, hygienics, etc., constitute the matters considered by the meetings and the organization, now a young one, is said to be increasing at a very rapid rate.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha meeting will be held sometime in October, the exact date not having been arranged.</p>

                            <p>Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department has taken active steps to force the collection of the subscriptions to exposition stock which have not been paid in full.  Due warning was given some time ago to all delinquent subscribers that legal steps would be taken to force the payment of these subscriptions and a large number paid in the balance due, but there are many others who have simply ignored the notices and warnings.  At the April meeting of the Board of Directors Mr. Lindsey was instructed to take action at once to force the payment of all <choice><sic>delinquncies</sic><corr>delinquencies</corr></choice> and the time since that date has been occupied in getting ready and issuing final notices.  The last day of grace has now passed and all subscriptions of $50 or over which remain unpaid have been placed in the hands of Attorney Matthew A. Hall, who will at once take all necessary steps to compel the payment of the full subscriptions.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Work on the Exposition Grounds Being Rushed at Top Speed.</head>
                            <head type="sub">VERY LITTLE REMAINS TO BE DONE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Main Buildings Are Now Receiving Their Exhibits and the Smaller Structures Are Being Hurried Ahead.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Increased activity is the watchword at the exposition grounds as the time approaches when the gates must be thrown open to the world and the great industrial exposition of the west stand on dress parade for the inspection of all comers.  Great as has been the efforts in the last year to push the work of preparation, these efforts are now being redoubled.  Large gangs of men are working in every portion of the spacious grounds, adding the finishing touches here and there to landscape work and to buildings, and this numerous army has recently been augmented by carpenters and decorators in the interior of the buildings, who are preparing the booths for the exhibitors.</p>
                            <p>Thousands of people visit the grounds every day to admire the beauty everywhere apparent.  The few pleasant days just passed have been taken advantage of to the fullest extent and the portions of the grounds open to vehicles have been thronged with carriages of every description.  The main court being closed to vehicles, people are compelled to go afoot, but this has proved no drawback, and a procession of people is constantly passing around the lagoon or through the buildings.</p>
                            <p>The water has been turned into the lagoon and the big basin is nearly full.  The supply came from a four-inch pipe near the east end of the lagoon and the great volume flowing from this pipe was sufficient to fill it in a remarkably short time.  The sheet piling about the lagoon has been hidden behind a coating of cement made to resemble a stone wall and the appearance of the lagoon is greatly improved thereby.</p>
                            <p>The paving of the broad walks between the lagoon and the buildings of the main court is being pushed with the greatest possible speed.  The rainy weather of last week made it impossible to prosecute this work, but the time thus lost is being rapidly made up.  The paving is completed west of Twentieth street and a start was made at the east end of the main court.  This paving has reached the west ends of the Mines and Machinery buildings and there remains but a comparatively small amount to be completed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Buildings Yet to Be Finished.</head>
                            <p>The only work of construction now in progress in the main court comprises the Arch of States, the east colonnades, the park colonnades and the Girls' and Boys' building.  All of these are in an advanced stage and all will be completed within a very few days.  The other buildings are completed and in all except the Art building the work of installing the exhibits has commenced.  The big trusses for the bridges which are to span the lagoon at Twentieth street have arrived on the ground and the bridges will be completed in short order.</p>
                            <p>In the Agriculture building five exhibits are in course of preparation.  The Nebraska Exposition commission, Douglas county, the Rock Island railway, the Cotton Belt railway and the state of Montana are actively at work preparing their exhibits.  All are erecting elaborate booths and preparing for displays which will be works of art.</p>
                            <p>In the Manufactures building the gallery is being elaborately decorated by the force preparing for the state educational exhibit.  On the main floor booths are being erected for a number of exhibitors.</p>
                            <p>In the Mines building the state of Montana and Utah are the only ones to make their appearance.  A large number of other states have sent notice that they are on the way with their exhibits and they will arrive during the coming week.</p>
                            <p>The Bluff tract is daily growing more beautiful.  People who have not visited this portion of the grounds since last fall or during the winter are amazed at the change which has been wrought in its appearance.  The trees of all sizes and varieties are taking on leaves and the grass sod which was sown about three weeks ago has covered the entire tract with a luxuriant carpet of rich green.</p>
                            <p>The Horticulture building is nearly completed and the great beauty of this handsome building is the source of many remarks on the part of visitors.  The Iowa building is making remarkable headway.  The main portion of the building has already reached the cornice line and it seems assured that the building will be completed by May 20, as provided in the contract for its construction.  The Council Bluffs wigwam, close to the Iowa building, has reached the lower part of the second story.</p>
                            <p>Up on the north tract the Agricultural Implement and Transportation building and the Dairy and Apiary buildings are all in a state bordering very closely on completion.</p>
                            <p>From end to end of the Midway everything is activity.  Every concessionaire is bending all his energies to complete his buildings on time and there is every prospect that all will succeed.</p>

                            <p>A carload of paintings for the exposition was received Saturday at the custom house.  They were shipped from Detroit and are bonded for $12,000.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The proposed enlargement of the powers of General Superintendent Foster formed the subject of a prolonged and stormy executive session of the Board of Directors of the exposition yesterday afternoon, without any action being taken on the matter.  The meeting was an adjourned session of the special meeting of Friday of last week, when the executive committee was instructed to submit a report on the necessity for creating the position of director general or enlarging the powers of the present general superintendent.  The proceedings followed the reading of the majority and minority reports were in executive session, but the closed windows and doors were all too thin to confine the sound of the heated arguments within the confines of the directors' room.  The sound floated out over the transoms and under the doors, revealing the fact that the members of the board were indulging in the most animated discussion.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-seven directors were present when the meeting was called to order,  but others drifted in and when the final vote was taken it showed the presence of thirty-three members of the board.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the meeting was called to order and before any other business had been presented General Manderson presented the following resolution and moved its adoption:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the directors of the Transmississippi Exposition that there should be no free list or passes to the exposition on and after June 1, 1898.  The executive committee is directed to formulate rules by which none but exhibitors, employes in the actual discharge of their duties, reporters for the press when acting as such, officers and members of the executive committee is directed to formulate rules by which none but exhibitors, employes in the actual discharge of their duties, reporters for the press when acting as such, officers and members of the executive committee shall be admitted free to said grounds.  It is the intent of this resolution that no stockholder or director shall be provided with free passes.</p>
                            <p>A brief discussion followed the introduction of this resolution, some of the executive committee opposing summary action on a resolution involving a matter which they had been considering for the last two months.  The matter was finally referred to the executive committee with instructions to make a report on the matter at the regular meeting of the board Friday of this week.</p>

                            <p>This cleared the decks for action and Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee presented the following majority report of the executive committee regarding the matter referred to the committee at the special meeting of Friday.</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The executive committee fails to see the necessity for a director general, general superintendent or general manager and staff who, as is contemplated, shall exercise supreme executive authority in all matters pertaining to the exposition and, furthermore, believing that no such necessity exists, hereby resolves,</p>
                            <p>First, that it is unwise at this late date to change the general plan of organization and the present method of conducting the business of the exposition;</p>
                            <p>Second, that we recommend that the title of general superintendent be abolished and that said title of general superintendent be changed to that of superintendent of Department of Grounds and Buildings.</p>
                            <p>This was signed by Z. T. Lindsey, E. E. Bruce, W. N. Babcock and A. L. Reed.</p>
                            <p>The reading of the majority report was followed immediately by the reading of the following minority report, signed by Manager Rosewater:</p>
                            <p>To the Board of Directors:  Gentlemen&#8212;I regret exceedingly my inability to concur in the conclusions reached by my colleagues of the executive committee relating to the future management and control of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Every exposition held in this or any other country has had in supreme control one executive officer whose orders and directions all subordinates and employes were expected to respect and obey and whose functions for the general supervision of the active work of the exposition were limited only by such regulations as might from time to time be established by the board of directors, or its executive committee.</p>
                            <p>In my judgment the appointment of such an officer is imperatively demanded at this time.  The consensus of opinion in this board of directors as far back as October, 1897, was that a director general or general manager was needed and a special committee appointed by your board in November, 1897, explicitly declared in favor of such an officer, but recommended only the appointment of a general superintendent of all departments, with the understanding that a general manager or director general should be appointed at the proper time, before the opening of the exposition.  Having no reason to change my views and being firmly convinced that the failure to confer upon the general superintendent such authority was would give him ample power to enable him to control the affairs on the grounds has cost the exposition many thousands of dollars, I deem it my duty to recommend the enlargement of the powers of the general superintendent, under the title of general manager, subject only to such legislative restrictions by the executive committee as will keep the supervisory executive power in its hands.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Debate on the Reports.</head>
                            <p>As soon as this report was read Mr. Rosewater moved an executive session and the motion carried unanimously.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the doors were closed the debate commenced and for two and one-half hours there was no cessation in the flow of oratory.  The discussion was general, but the principal talks were made by General Manderson, E. Rosewater, Alvin Saunders and J. C. Wharton in support of the enlargement of the powers of the general superintendent, and by G. M. Hitchcock, C. S. Montgomery and John L. Webster in support of the majority report, abolishing the position of general superintendent.</p>
                            <p>At an early stage of the proceedings General Manderson offered a resolution as a substitute for the majority and minority reports.  This resolution provided for enlarging the powers of the general superintendent and giving him full control over the employes, with power to discharge them for cause.</p>
                            <p>When the discussion threatened to last all night a motion was made to lay the whole subject matter on the table.  This was carried by 18 ayes and 15 noes.</p>
                            <p>The regular meeting of the board will occur Friday of this week and it is probable that the whole matter will come up again for further discussion and settlement.</p>

                            <p>Nevada has arrived at the exposition in the person of Colonel H. B. Maxson of Reno, vice president of the exposition for his state, and "the whole thing" in exposition matters.  The colonel has been working singly and alone to have Nevada well represented and he says he has a car load of mineral and agricultural products on the way.  This car is attached to an "orange special" and is coming through on passenger time, being due to arrive in Omaha Wednesday night.  Colonel Maxson says the car is decorated with a huge banner extending from end to end on both sides of the car on which, in letters two feet long, is the classic legend, "Nevada Exhibits go to the Omaha Exposition or Bust."</p>
                            <p>"I have 16,000 pounds of minerals and 5,000 pounds of agricultural products in that car," said Colonel Maxson, "and we are going to have an exhibit such as no other state will have.  We haven't as much money to expend on our booth and surroundings as some of the states are spending for that purpose, but we will have some mineral displays that no other state will have."</p>
                            <p>Colonel Maxson was accompanied by M. A. West, who will remain in charge of the exhibit throughout the exposition.  The work of installation will commence at once and Colonel Maxson promises a fine showing both in the Mines and Agriculture buildings.</p>

                            <head type="sub">President Wattles Asks One to Consider Some Important Business.</head>
                            <p>A special meeting of the Board of Directors of the exposition has been called by President Wattles for Wednesday afternoon at 4 o'clock to consider the question of live stock premiums, the matter of a bond issue "and such other business as may be presented for consideration."</p>
                            <p>The question of offering cash premiums for live stock exhibits is one which has been discussed by the executive committee and has been pressing the directors for some time.  So far as official action is concerned the exposition has offered as premiums on live stock medals and diplomas only.  This is very unsatisfactory to the stockmen and great pressure has been brought to bear on the executive committee and on members of the Board of Directors to have cash premiums offered instead of medals.  The members of the South Omaha Live Stock exchange and representatives of the packing houses have taken a hand in the matter and are urging the claims of the stockmen.  In addition to this pressure it is now announced that the people of Kansas City are making great preparations for a live stock show this fall in which $75,000 in cash prizes is to be offered as a tempting bait to the breeders of fancy stock.  Governor Glick, chairman of the Kansas Exposition commission, and a prominent stock breeder, when he was in Omaha recently urged the exposition management to offer cash premiums and presented a number of arguments in favor of such action.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee yesterday afternoon awarded the contract for the construction of the Service Building.  The carpenter work was awarded to Thomas Herd at his bid of $4,600 and the staff work was awarded to F. A. Sieffert for $1,431.</p>
                            <p>Bids were received for supplying 100 uniforms for the Exposition guards by Browning-King &amp; Co., and the Continental Clothing company.  Both bids were the same figures, being $9.50 for the suit, $1 for the hat.  The contract was awarded to Browning-King &amp; Co., the quality of the sample submitted being slightly superior.  The uniform consists of navy blue sack coat and trousers.  The coat will be double-breasted with brass buttons and trousers will have a white stripe on the outside seam.  The hat is the United States army regulation campaign hat with brass ornaments.</p>

                            <p>Arrangements are being made through the Bureau of Education for an exhibit of great interest and value from an educational standpoint.  This is a collection of historic material belonging to Prof. Frederick Starr of the University of Chicago, consisting of metal work of the ancient Mexicans, musical instruments of the Aztecs, and a collection of instruments of warfare.  All of this collection represents the work of years <choice><sic>or</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> research among the ruins of the southwest portion of the United States and Mexico.

                            <p>Every day marks rapid progress at the grounds.  Some work is completed and new begun.  There is no lagging and everything is being pushed rapidly, the contractors of buildings and superintendents of exhibits working their forces to the fullest capacity.  Much work remains to be done before June 1, but not a minute's time is being lost.  The work on the grounds is making great headway during the delightful weather of the last few days.  New booths are being erected almost daily in the various buildings.  One contractor seems to have more than his hands full in the booth business and says he cannot secure enough carpenters.  The lagoon has been filled and presents a beautiful appearance to the hundreds of daily visitors who throng the grounds, admiring the splendid architecture and magnitude of the buildings, as well as the general plat of the entire exposition.  The grounds and buildings cover twice the amount of space which many have accredited them.</p>
                            <p>Ever since the exhibits have commenced to be installed visitors have been entirely excluded from entering the Government building and all seem to take their rejection therefrom complacently.  The Utah booths are being erected in the Agricultural hall under the supervision of S. T. Whittaker of Ogden, who will also have charge of the entire Utah exhibits, comprising the agricultural, mines and mining, and manufacturers during the exposition.  Mr. Whittaker received word yesterday that three carloads of exhibits were on the way and likely to arrive any day, and he is rushing work in order to be ready to receive them.  The carpenters have commenced work on the booth in which will be represented the Burlington railway.  A picture of the prairies of Nebraska in 1868, showing everything as being barren, and a picture of a Nebraska farm in 1898, thirty years later, will show what wonderful progress has been made.  There will be groups of grains in straw, etc., wild and tame grasses, pictures of a prairie schooner, which in the early days was the chief mode of travel, and then a picture of a Burlington train, showing the manner in which people travel nowadays.</p>
                            <p>The only exhibit on the floor of the Machinery and Electrical hall is that of the Buffalo Scale company, which will show the great progress made in scales.</p>
                            <p>A. Hospe of Omaha has a force of carpenters at work erecting a booth in the Liberal Arts building, which he expects to make quite an extensive exhibit.</p>

                            <p>A visit to the department from which is to be furnished the power for the machinery and the furnishing of electric lights for the exposition reveals a maze of machinery of every description.  Great progress has been made here and the work would have been almost completed had not the shipping of material been delayed some little time.  M. F. Pennywell of Chicago has been here since April 24 as chief engineer and superintendent of machinery department.  Since arriving here he has succeeded in placing and getting in first class running order all the necessary machinery for propelling power.  There are four boilers of 600 horse power each and two boilers of 300 horse power each.  These boilers are fed with one Marsh pump of 1,000 horse power capacity and one Gardner pump of 1,600 horse pump.  They are also equipped with injectors to the capacity of each boiler.  The engines comprise those of the very best manufacture, there being three Westinghouse engines of 400 horse power each, compound non-condensing, running 255 revolutions to the minute; one Sioux-Corliss, built at Burlington, Ia., of 500 horse power.  This engine will furnish the power for Machinery hall and power generator.  There is one 200 horse power Buffalo Forge company high speed engine, 250 revolutions per minute; one Imperial engine, 200 horse power, running 250 engine revolutions per minute; one Hamilton-Corliss heavy duty engine of 300 horse power, running 100 revolutions per minute.  Here is perhaps as fine and large a combination of engines and boilers as were ever used for a similar purpose.</p>
                            <p>The electrical department is being placed in position by Henry Rustin, superintendent, and his foreman, R. H. Moore of Atlanta, Ga., together with a large force of competent men.  Mr. Moore has had considerable experience in arranging this work, being engaged in the same position at the Nashville Centennial.  Four Brush 125 arc light dynamos are being placed in position, there being some little delay in the arrival of two.  There are four alternating current dynamos of 120 kilo-watt powers each.  A steam engine's power is reckoned by horse power, while that of electricity is known as the kilo-watt, which is equal to about one and one-third horse power.  Two 180 kilo-watt and one 270 kilo-watt power generators, which together with those above mentioned, give a capacity of 14,000 sixteen-candle power incandescent lights, 500 arc lights and 350 horse power and motors.  Two of the Brush dynamos which are in place have been tested and are highly satisfactory.  The power generator is also in position.  One of the 180 kilo-watt generators will receive its test this afternoon.  The switch boards, consisting of six marble and one slate panel have arrived and are being placed on the walls.  Although there has been a delay in receiving material Mr. Moore says that he expects to have everything in readiness by next week.</p>

This work will be completed in a few days, when the work of placing painting, occupying offices, etc., will occur.</p>
                            <p>The work on the electrical fountain in the west end of the lagoon is advancing rapidly, and the pipes will most likely be laid today.  The sculptor work has been raised to its position at the top of the mast forming the fountain.</p>
                            <p>Work on the Kansas state building, which occupies a position on the Bluff tract to the east of the Horticultural building, has been commenced and it is fast attaining huge proportions.  The plans show it to be a pretty structure, similar to that of Iowa.</p>
                            <p>The New York state building is to be quite a large one, work having already begun on it by Dunnavant &amp; Thompson, contractors.  The building will be 32x68 feet and forty feet high, with a twelve-foot porch surrounding it entirely.  The floors are to be leveled and used for dancing purposes.  The main floor will be thirty-two feet square.  There will be rooms for men and women, toilet rooms, a private office and a main office.  It is to be completed throughout by June 10.</p>

                            <p>The weekly rehearsals of the Exposition chorus have been productive of a great improvement in the proficiency of that highly creditable organization.  The regular rehearsal at the city hall last night was well attended and the manner in which a new selection was disposed of demonstrated the effect of the thorough drilling to which the chorus has been subjected at weekly intervals since its organization.  The new number in question was a selection from "Bohemian Girl," entitled, "Thou Who in Might Supreme."  This is one of the selections in the chorus book, compiled for the use of the Exposition chorus, and is a very tuneful number, presenting several difficulties of execution.  It was well handled and was laid aside for future consideration in the way of finishing touches.</p>
                            <p>The remainder of the evening was taken up with selections from the "Daughter of Jairus" and "Rose Maiden."  These works have been well learned and the manner in which they were sung by the chorus last night showed that the Omaha chorus will have nothing to be ashamed of when it appears in public.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. A. McIvor Brisbine, editor of the Chicago Musical Times and a singer of note, was present during the rehearsal and at the close she warmly congratulated Conductor Kelly on the manner in which the chorus performed the diversified work assigned to it during the evening.  She spoke in terms of high praise of the excellent quality and volume of tone of the chorus, and of the manner in which the directions of the baton were followed.</p>
                            <p>Conductor Kelly called the attention of the chorus to the fact that there were a few absentees, and he announced that a system would be established at once to provide for deducting a certain number of concerts for each absence, thus preventing those who do not attend rehearsals regularly from attending all of the concerts that will be given in the Auditorium.  He remarked that there will be but three more regular rehearsals before the chorus must appear in public to participate in the exercises on the opening day and there is no time to lose in perfecting the work in hand.</p>

The members had visited the exposition grounds during the day and all were well pleased with the Nebraska state building, which will be placed in charge of the custodian, F. M. Whittaker, at once.  The commission has notified the vice president of Ohio that Nebraska has provided desk room in its state building for the Ohio commission.  Mrs. W. H.

                            <p>The Nebraska state building and various exhibits will be ready by June 1, and the president was requested to notify the president of the Transmississippi Exposition to this effect, and that the commission would be glad to assist them in the opening exercises wherever they are desirous of placing them.

                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;"President McKinley will touch the button and deliver an address through the long distance telephone on the opening day of the Transmississippi Exposition," said Representative Mercer this morning.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Mercer did not participate in the interview had by the Nebraska delegates Saturday with President McKinley in relation to the Marine band going to Omaha on account of other engagements, but in the afternoon he called at the White House to secure, if possible, the consent of the president to touch the button and also have the chief executive deliver an address.  The president agreed to do so, expressing his regret that he could not open the exposition in person, in which he felt a large interest, but hoped that conditions might be such as to warrant his leaving Washington for a few days during this summer.  Mercer then took up the marine band proposition and from the talk he had with President McKinley inferred  that the band might be allowed to go for several days.</p>
                            <p>Stamps in honor of the Transmississippi Exposition are now all engraved and the bureau of printing and engraving is ready to print the same as soon as a decision is reached by the postoffice department whether the stamps shall be in one or two colors.  If in two colors two sets of plates will have to be used, but if only in one color it will be very east to transfer the border of one plate to the center of another, thereby making one complete plate which will be decidedly easy of handling.  But should the Postoffice department decide on two colors the printing will have to be done on a hand press and the closest possible registration of plates will have to be made, all of which takes time.  Senator Thurston will call in the morning on the Postoffice department to urge an early decision upon the question of color.  Assistant Secretary Vanderslip stated today that if nothing was heard in the next day or two from the Postoffice department the bureau of printing and engraving would go ahead on two colors.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Trip to Omaha.</head>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the interest manifested by all classes of people in Washington in regard to war, the correspondents representing newspapers here had an opportunity to think of other things than the mobilization of troops or the possibility of flotilla intervention at sea, by realizing through the following notice posted upon the bulletin board of the house press gallery that the great international exposition was about to open at Omaha:</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha, Neb., from June to November of the present year, has through its Department of Publicity and Promotion, authorized the undersigned representatives in Washington of the Nebraska daily newspapers to extend a cordial invitation to correspondents to visit the exposition as guests of the management.  A special train of Pullman cars will be furnished for the round trip, and while in Omaha, as en route, the visitors will be extended all courtesies without expense to themselves.  The date of leaving is yet undetermined and will not be decided upon until after an expression is received of the time most convenient to the majority of the working newspaper men of Washington.</p>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 7.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Concerted efforts are being made to have the Navy department rescind its action as to the Marine band going to Omaha to open the exposition.  After talking with the president Secretary Long informed Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn of the War department that the former permission given tot he band to go west had been countermanded in view of existing conditions, the president believing it was not the proper thing to allow the band to leave Washington during the continuance of war.</p>
                            <p>In view of the interdiction placed on the band in accepting the contract to go to Omaha, five of the eight members of the Nebraska delegation held a conference with Assistant Secretary Roosevelt of the Navy department this morning in relation to the matter.  There were present at this conference Senator Thurston and Representatives Mercer, Strode, Stark and Sutherland.  Roosevelt knew nothing of the prohibition placed on the band and gave as his opinion that the Musical union of Washington may have had something to do with the change in arrangements.  He suggested that as the president had taken a stand in the matter he thought it proper to go to the head of the nation and secure his permission, if possible.  Owing to this being cabinet day it was decided to postpone the visit of the delegation to the White House until the president had been consulted as to what time would be most convenient for him to see the delegation.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston accordingly wired the president as follows this afternoon: "Omaha and Nebraska people made a contract with the Marine band and fill an engagement.  They now understand that orders are changed prohibiting the band from going.  Our people are greatly exercised.  Will entail much loss on the exposition.  The band has been extensively advertised and the matter is urgent.  The entire Nebraska delegation asks that the band be permitted to go.  We wish to wait on you, if necessary, at your earliest convenience.  Will you please designate a time?"</p>
                            <p>To this message President McKinley replied about 5 o'clock, stating that he would see the delegation tomorrow at 11 o'clock and at once notices were sent out calling the members together, when they will endeavor to change the mind of the president as to the propriety of allowing the band to leave Washington at this time.</p>

                            <p>A party of twenty-four editors from the principal points in Wisconsin along the line of the Northwestern railway are the guests of the railway company and the exposition management today, and are being entertained right royally.</p>
                            <p>The visitors arrived on the regular train at 8:35 a. m.  They were met at the depot by Major T. S. Clarkson.  The party was accompanied by J. L. Ferguson, assistant general passenger agent of the Northwestern, and S. F. Miller, the general agent of the road at Oshkosh, Wis.  After breakfast the visitors went to the exposition grounds with Major Clarkson, and were shown over the entire grounds and through the buildings.  All expressed great surprise and admiration for the beauty of the scene and the magnitude of the plan.  They had read about the exposition and had seen plenty of pictures, but they freely admitted that their conception of the whole affair had been very far from the truth, as it appeared after an examination.  They made frequent comparisons of the architecture with that of the World's fair, declaring that the beauty of the Main court, while on a smaller scale, was superior to the far-famed magnificence of the Grand Court of Honor at Chicago.</p>
                            <p>At noon the visitors were entertained at luncheon at the Dellone hotel by the exposition management.  Short talks were made after the necessities of the inner man had been attended to, Major Clarkson representing the exposition in the absence of the officers and members of the executive committee, who were detained elsewhere by the business of the exposition.  Major Clarkson, Judge W. S. McHugh, W. S. Poppleton talked about the exposition and remarks on behalf of the visitors were made by several members of the party.  The latter expressed a determination to stir up the people of Wisconsin to a realization of the magnitude and importance of the exposition and to induce the people to come and see for themselves.</p>
                            <p>The visitors will return home on the regular train of the Northwestern at 6:45 p. m.</p>
                            <p>The following is a list of those in the party:  P. M. Conkey of the Crescent, and E. Humphrey of the Post, Appleton; R. B. Howell, News, Beloit; T. H.

                            <div3>
                            <p>Every person engaged at the exposition grounds seems to be working for one purpose only and that is the completion of everything that pertains to the Transmississippi Exposition so that the opening day will find everything started in regular machinery line order.  Much remains to be done, but thousands of workmen are fast completing the buildings.  Much surprise was manifested by the Sunday visitors as well as those of yesterday at the rapid advance that was made in one short week.  The beautiful lawns, which have not been a month is growing, and the nice gravel and brick walks cause many compliments from the hundreds of daily visitors to the grounds.  No little pains are being used to make these one of the most pleasant and commodious parts of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>In the Government building is a veritable beehive of employes, placing exhibits in position.  In order to facilitate the work visitors have been entirely excluded from the building.  Yesterday the Navy department was engaged in unpacking and placing its exhibits and the work is going forward rapidly.  The models of the battleships Maine and Charleston were unpacked and are now in position.  The lighthouse exhibit, which is under the control of the Treasury department, has been received and is in the hands of the decorators, who will see that it receives careful consideration in display.  In the center of the building, on the floor under the dome, has been erected a large and substantial foundation, which will act as a support for the great bi-valve lens light, which stands thirty-five feet high, is shaped like a saucer, five feet in diameter, and composed of triangular pieces of glass set around in a circle.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Setting Up Agricultural Exhibits.</head>
                            <p>Aside from the Government building the greatest activity prevails in the Agricultural building, where the Nebraska commission, the states of Montana and Minnesota, Douglas county, the Rock Island and the Cotton Belt railways are at work erecting their booths, etc.  That of Nebraska is the farthest advanced and the placing of exhibits is expected to commence within a few days.  Aside from Superintendent Johnson's state exhibits nearly twenty counties have applied for space and are expected to arrive this week.  To the north of the Nebraska booth the various flouring establishments of the state will exhibit and they will be on the floor this week.</p>
                            <p>The Minnesota state agricultural exhibit is under the management of Charles J. Lundberg, who has a force of men at work erecting the booth.  Mr. Lundberg says he will have a fine exhibit of grain, and especially of wheat, showing the magnificent quality which his state yields.</p>
                            <p>General Passenger Agent Francis of the Burlington railroad visited the Agricultural building in the forenoon and after finding the space allotted to his road secured his carpenter force on the grounds, who expect to commence work shortly.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures building shows considerable movement and especially is this so in the gallery, where Assistant <choice><sic>Sueprintendent</sic><corr>Superintendent</corr></choice> of Public Instruction Stewart is busily at work with a force of men in getting his frame work in readiness for the reception of the educational exhibit, which is expected to arrive almost any day.  Mr. Stewart has been delayed some little time on account of the building not being completed earlier and his work must be done with a rush.  He has the entire length of the gallery on the north side and half on the south.  A greater portion of the south side will be occupied with the exhibits from the denominational schools of the state.  The University of Nebraska has been assigned space in the southeast corner, while the entire length of the north side will be occupied by the public school work.  The schools throughout the entire state have responded nicely to the state superintendent's call for display work and visitors from abroad cannot help but be impressed with the work done.  On the lower floor booths are being erected for exhibitors and great headway made with every day.</p>

                            <p>Four specimens of anthracite coal were received in the Mines and Mining building yesterday.  They were shipped here by M. S. Kemmerer, a coal operator of Mauch Chunk, Pa., the two largest weighing two and one-half tons each.  Dr. Day, chief of the mining bureau, says they are without doubt the finest and largest specimens ever placed on exhibition at any fair or centennial.  They were taken from twenty-five and eighteen-foot veins, 600 to 650 feet below the surface of the earth and 150 to 200 feet below the sea level.  The coal has 95 per cent burning quality, leaving but very little ashes.</p>
                            <p>The lagoon is nearly filled, the water having been turned into it Saturday.  The big trusses for the bridges which are to span the lagoon are being placed in position and everything points to an early completion of this work.  The brick walk on the north court has been completed and attention will now be directed to that on the south, which will necessitate but a few days.</p>
                            <p>The patrol lights about the grounds and in the buildings are in readiness for the turning on of the current, a satisfactory test having already been made.</p>
                            <p>John H. Rowe, J. Newton Nind and L. C. Pryor of the Minnesota building committee are in the city and visited the grounds, preparing for the erection of the Minnesota state building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mrs. Brisbine Tells of the Success of This Part of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Mrs. A. McIvor Brisbine, the special eastern commissioner of the exposition, is in the city after a trip to eastern musical centers in the interest of the musical department as well as of certain other departments of the great enterprise.  Mrs. Brisbine is musical editor of the Chicago Musical Times.  She is an artist of wide reputation and the very embodiment of activity and general musical knowledge.  One of the principal objects of her visit to the east was to make arrangements with the principal American composers for original works to be produced in connection with the exposition.  In this she was highly successful and the music of the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be marked by original music by these composers, which will be rendered by a great orchestra and by the most noted singers of the age.</p>
                            <p>Chief among these performances will be an opening ode, which will be sung on the opening day by the Omaha chorus, accompanied by the Theodore Thomas orchestra.  This will be an ode composed expressly for the occasion set to music by one of the most noted of American composers.  The details of this ode, the names of the composer and writer, are to be announced shortly.  In addition to this there will be numerous compositions by American composers of note, among them Mrs. H. H. A. Beach of Boston, E. A. McDowell, occupying the chair of music of Columbia college; Ethelbert Nevin of New York, Harry Loomis of New York and others.  These works will be both vocal and instrumental and the former will be in the hands of the best known American singers, while the latter will be rendered by the matchless Thomas orchestra.</p>
                            <p>"The musical people and musical critics throughout the east are very greatly interested in this exposition," said Mrs. Brisbine.  "The move of the musical director, Mr. Kimball, in securing the Thomas orchestra for a long engagement has caused consternation among eastern musical people.  The securing of the Chicago Apollo club for three days was another well executed move, and all these things cause a great deal of comment among the people of the east.  The great critics like Krehbil of the New York Tribune, Philip Hale of the Boston Journal, Fink of the New York Post, Henderson of the New York Times, and many others have told me that they were watching matters in the musical line at this exposition with great interest.  The musical papers are also printing quantities of matter regarding the musical features of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"Aside from the articles which will appear in the musical papers regarding the musical features of the exposition," continued Mrs. Brisbine, "there will be exposition matter on other topics appearing in some of the big magazines in the near future.  Munsey's for June, for instance, will contain a full-page cut of the composite picture which represents the condensed beauty of the women of the west.  The Puritan for July will contain an article regarding the representative Omaha women connected socially with the exposition.  The musical Record of Boston will in its June issue contain an elaborate article of special interest to Omaha people treating of the music of the exposition and Omaha generally, from a musical standpoint. it will cover four pages of Philip Hale's well known magazine.</p>
                            <p>"There is no doubt the people of the east are coming to Omaha during the exposition," said Mrs. Brisbine.  "The war scare is having its effect on eastern resorts and the cottages along the sound which are always reserved long before this time are standing idle with no prospect of being occupied.  Real estate men told me there is no inquiry for seaside cottages and railway men say all the people are coming west.  The travel in this direction will be very heavy and it will really all come through Omaha.  They will come in great crowds and nothing can prevent the exposition being a most tremendous success if crowds have anything to do with it."</p>

                            <p>CLEVELAND, O., May 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Hon. Harry C. Mason, speaker of the Ohio general assembly and one of the Ohio commissioners to the Omaha exposition, returned today from a trip of inspection to Omaha.  Mr. Mason gave a flattering statement of the magnitude of the big show and while expressing regret that so little had been done by Ohio and by this city to contribute to its success said he intended to stir up the business men of Cleveland to greater activity.</p>
                            <p>"Up to date," said the speaker, "there are only sixty-two Ohio exhibitors, and eighteen of these are from Cleveland.  The bicycle industry is well represented, but outside of the American Wire Nail company and the Cleveland Twist Drill company there are few large firms of Cleveland represented.  It ought not to be so, for the Omaha exposition will be second only to the World's fair and will be a great card for manufacturers to help to broaden their business.  Louisiana is putting up a $2,500 building in one part of the exposition grounds and the state of New York has one for $2,500.  We only made a $3,000 appropriation and my idea is that the money will be spent in providing accommodation at the show for people from Ohio who visit the exposition.  A space will be reserved where they can check garments and stop to meet friends.  There is hardly enough money to put up much of a building."</p>
                            <p>Speaker Mason said that the Ohio commissioners were practically the guests of the exposition during their stay and that he showed them many courtesies.</p>

                            <p>A well attended meeting of the New England club was held last night at the office of A. P. Tukey of Maine.  W. H. Alexander of Connecticut occupied the chair and the business of the evening was announced to be the arrangement of a New England day at the exposition.  September 15 was decided upon and an effort will be made to bring prominent New England citizens here on that day.  It is thought that both Thomas B. Reed and John D. Long may be secured.  Interesting New England sentiments were exchanged among Colonel Chase of New <choice><sic>Hamshire</sic><corr>Hampshire</corr></choice>, W. G. Whitmore of Massachusetts and others and it was determined to do as much personal advertising of the exposition and of New England day throughout the east as possible.</p>

The train will leave Chicago June 4 and arrive in Denver June 6.  On the return trip, about a week later, many of the delegates will stop in Omaha and visit the exposition.  A committee of local physicians and Medical Director Lee have invited the delegates to stop in the city and it is expected that large numbers will take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Intend to Have an Old-Time Feast of Corn Pone and 'Possum in the Near Future.</head>
                            <p>Like the typical Missourians they are the members of the Misosuri club got into a warm discussion last night as to just what part of the Missouri river it was that the world famed cargo of whisky sank in 1840.  Some of the club members have relatives who have hunted for the precious treasure and all looked interested when the flavor that whisky must have attained by this time was mentioned.  But from this subject the club passed to a discussion of plans for interesting all Missourians in the city in the club and a regular old-time Missouri supper was planned to take place in the near future.  Corn bread and 'possum and hominy and "punkin" will be served and genuine Havanas will yield to the old original "Missouri meerschaum."  A fiddler will play "Arkansas Traveler" during the evening and nothing will be left undone to carry Missourians back to the time of their childhood.</p>
                            <p>Cards will be issued in a few days for a general meeting of Missourians to be held at the Commercial club next Wednesday night, at which time the preparations for the supper and entertainment will be perfected.</p>
                            <p>A committee of ten Missourians will attend the St. Joseph jubilee on Wednesday and Thursday.  A speaker will be taken along and the delegation will represent Omaha at the jubilee and endeavor to bring the exposition before Missourians in as good a light as possible.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commissioners Preparing a Surprise for Even Their Constituents.</head>
                            <p>The exhibit of Douglas county food stuffs at the exposition is being prepared on a scale that will be a matter of pride and surprise to those interested in the country's agricultural welfare.  In the Goodrich block, Twenty-fourth and Paul streets, the county commissioners are at work putting an immense amount of material into shape to indicate the resources of the county.  The goods on hand is very largely that preserved from the Douglas county agricultural society exhibit held last fall and includes about two carloads of corn, wheat, oats, rye, barley, potatoes and seeds.</p>
                            <p>One of the officials in charge of the task of sorting and arranging the material says the public has very little idea of the range and superiority of Douglas county products.  It is a fact, he says, that in no similar area in the world outside of irrigated districts are there products so diversified or so luxuriant.  The exhibit which is being arranged will show in corn alone a variety of sixty kinds.  Most of the exhibits of corn will be shown attached to the stalks of corn will be grouped in attractive displays.  The stalks will be bound together in red, yellow and green, and the Ak-Sar-Ben colors will be further used in the color arrangement of the Douglas county exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The greatest care has been necessary to preserve the material at hand in a perfect condition during the winter.  It has been mostly stored in the basement at the present quarters in a certain fixed temperature.  Dampness has been guarded against to prevent mould or sprouting, and warmth has been equally undesirable as a promoter of dryness and consequent cracks.  The conditions have been so satisfactory that very little loss has occurred and more than enough is on hand to stock the Douglas county space.</p>
                            <p>The work of sorting and preparing the products for exhibition purposes is in charge of six women, who have undertaken the enormous task of handling the material, spear by spear and grain by grain.  Quantities of Kentucky blue grass, over four feet high and finer than any grown in the Blue Grass state, have come through their hands and are ready for the decorative purposes of the construction artist.  Rye over six feet tall, worthy of a world premium, will also be largely used by Artist Englishman in the decorations.  He has at hand as well the whole of the 160 varieties of grasses grown in the county.  The main staple used in the decorations will of course be corn, which will appear in all imaginable forms and colors, from the mammoth Nebraska red to diminutive popcorn.  One handsome piece will show single samples <unclear reason="torn"/> the varieties grown in the county arranged about a decorative pillar.</p>
                            <p>Most of the work of constructing the displays is not shown to the public, as it is planned to surprise all competing counties with the completeness and artistic merit of the exhibit.  No one is admitted to the room where the artist and his force are busy preparing the component parts of the displays and it is promised that the results produced will be something extraordinary.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Life at Kountze Park and the Bluff Tract One Continual Round of Hurry to Finish the Great Task.</head>
                            <div3>
                          <p>To the daily visitors to the exposition grounds a city of no small proportions is presented and each temporary inhabitant appears to be on the go all the time, which gives life to the daily routine that has never been equaled unless it was at the World's fair.  This has been the case for the last few weeks and new life to the enterprise is being added daily.  Workmen of all classes are scattered throughout the grounds and each one is intent upon some particular mission which tends to the advancement of the Transmississippi Exposition.  They are so occupied with their work that they really are provoked at numerous interruptions from visitors inquiring about certain exhibits and work.  The humble laborer who carries the hod, digs trenches and lays the brick walk knows that he performing a duty that is as necessary to the success of the exposition as the master mechanic.  And the delightful brick walks will in no small manner facilitate the pedestrian on a rainy day.  The lagoon is admired by all visitors.  The water has the appearance as though coming from a lake and the waves blown up yesterday made a pretty picture.  The palms and small trees have been set around the lagoon at the east end, adding greatly to its picturesque effect.</p>
                            <p>The Bluff tract as well as the concessionaires plat shows a lively appearance.  The new state buildings in the course of construction on the Bluff tract are being pushed with all possible speed.  Minnesota will also be represented with a state building and secretary Danforth of the state commission is expected to arrive in Omaha in a few days.  He will remain here during the exposition and have charge of the state building.  The fine lawns on this tract are receiving great care and the visitor is impressed at first sight with the smoothness of the sward and freshness of the grass.</p>

                            <p>It may interest many, despite the fact that no visitors are permitted in the Government building, to know that the models of nearly all the prominent United States battleships, cruisers, etc., have been installed.  Among them are the Maine and Charleston, the New York, Texas, Baltimore, the dynamite cruiser, Vesuvius, the monitor Miantonomoh and the United States mail steamship City of Paris.  These models are exact counterparts of the ships now doing duty for this government, with the exception of the Maine.</p>
                            <p>The treasury exhibit is being installed by J. B. Morrey of Washington, who has performed a like duty at the World's fair, Atlanta and Nashville.  There have been forty secretaries of the treasury and the life size pictures of sixteen of the most prominent ones, both dead and living, have been hung on the walls.  There are several large cases showing the different moneys which have been and are in use boy our government.  The United States marine hospital exhibits have arrived.  There will be a complete operating room, also an X-ray room, in the latter of which will be given free exhibitions to visitors, surprising them after they enter by photographing the fingers, hand or head, revealing to them the bones.  The mint exhibit will be no small factor in the government display.  The coin press arrived yesterday from the mint at Philadelphia and will be placed in position sometime during the next few days.  Its weight is seven tons, and will show the means by which our coin money is stamped.  The lighthouse display has been cramped owing to the small space allotted it.  There will be four large lamps, the largest one being of the first order and now being set up.  It has the power of throwing light to a distance of from eight to ten miles, when suspended in the air about thirty feet.  It is to be lighted with electricity in order to let visitors understand its mechanism.  A life saving station has been erected just outside the building, where will be given three exhibitions daily of the work of throwing life lines and the rescuing of wrecked sailors.</p>

                            <p>Two new buildings, those of the exposition hospital and headquarters for the officers of the grounds, etc., have been commenced.  Many individual stands, where will be sold drinks, refreshments, lunches, etc., are going up all over the grounds, which added to the bee-hive movement that prevails throughout.</p>
                            <p>The building for the fire and police departments will be completed this week.  The upper floor will be used as sleeping and toilet apartments.  On the lower floor to the north will be several offices, while the front will be occupied by the two fire engines now enroute from New York, and the four horses.  The building is very commodiously arranged.</p>
                            <p>The sign in front of the Horticulture building, which reads, "This is our busy day; stay out," conveys the true aspect of things therein.  The workmen are doing their best to complete this building on time and they must not be disturbed at all.</p>
                            <p>The last of the sculptor's work on the Government building is about completed, it being the group on the south side, a counterpart of that on the north.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Visitors Express Warm Admiration for the Exposition Buildings.</head>
                            <p>In addition to the Wisconsin editors and railway men the Badger state was represented at the luncheon yesterday by H. D. Fisher of Florence, a member of the Wisconsin commission, who is staying in Omaha to oversee the construction of the Wisconsin State building on the bluff tract of the exposition grounds.  The exposition was represented by President Wattles and Major Clarkson.  After the wants of the inner man had been attended to Major Clarkson assumed the duties of toastmaster and called upon President Wattles.</p>
                            <p>The president referred to the power of the press upon the exposition, saying its success depends largely upon the support given it by the newspapers of the country.  He thanked the visitors for the substantial manner in which they had aided the enterprise in the past and assured them that the management fully appreciated what had been done.  He then sketched briefly the history of the exposition movement and the results which have been accomplished.  In closing he invited the guests of the occasion to visit Omaha during the exposition and assured them that the customary courtesies would be extended.  He also expressed the hope that they would carry the invitation of the exposition to the people of Wisconsin and urge the people to come, also.</p>
                            <p>C. J. Augustine, editor of the Menasha Press, was called for on behalf of the visitors to speak of his impressions.  He said his impression upon seeing the grounds was akin to amazement.  He had not been prepared to come so far into the west and find a white city of such grand proportions.  "I think the people of Wisconsin ought to know it thoroughly," said Mr. Augustine, earnestly.  "For our own encouragement as a patriotic commonwealth that takes a pride in the advancement of any section of our great country, we should come and see what has been done.  It is a matter of pride to any American citizen to find such development as a grand city like Omaha and a great state like Nebraska in a section of country which our forefathers regarded as a desert.  Wisconsin looks to the central west for patronage for her manufactories, and no surer way could be availed of than for the people to visit this exposition and for the manufacturers to have on exhibition here their products."</p>
                            <p>W. H. Buck of the Sheboygan Telegram said he had spent quite a little time at the World's fair and thought, after seeing the grandeur of the exposition grounds in Omaha, that any person might get as much enjoyment out of this exposition as at the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>D. W. Dunham of the Oshkosh Northwestern, said he could only say what he had already sent to his paper, viz: "The Wisconsin editorial party is amazed by what it has seen here.  Don't fail to come."</p>
                            <p>Major Clarkson closed the post prandial portion of the entertainment by recalling a few reminiscences of the early days in Omaha, thirty-one years ago, when Indians and buffalo were common sights, and referring to the changes which have been wrought since that time.  He called especial attention to the fact that not one dollar of indebtedness rests on the magnificent buildings and grounds which the visitors had inspected.</p>
                            <p>The visitors then adjourned to The Bee office where they were shown over the entire establishment.  They also visited the office of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, after which the party dispersed about <unclear reason="torn"/> and visited the points of interest until <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

The car contained twenty fine cases belonging to the state and valued at $150 each.  These were totally destroyed and the mineral specimens were rendered almost entirely useless, the labels being destroyed and the collection so badly mixed that Mr. Whittaker is afraid the mineral expert of the commission, Don Maguire, who is en route to Omaha, will not be able to distinguish the specimens and rearrange them.

                            <p>This resolution was passed by the board of directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition at a special meeting called to consider the matter yesterday afternoon.  It was the unanimous opinion of the live stock men present at the meeting that the action referred to will result in making the live stock section of the exposition the greatest show of live stock ever held in the United States.</p>
                            <p>This action of the board was taken after due and careful consideration of the matter.

It was stated that Kansas City is making preparations to get up a live stock show and offer $75,000 in cash premiums, and the exposition management was urged to reconsider the previous action in order that the advantages already possessed by Omaha might not be diminished.</p>
                            <p>President Elmendorf of the Cattle Breeders' Association of Nebraska was present and made a short but very forcible argument along the same lines, summing up his argument in the terse but expressive phrase, "No money, no show."</p>
                                <p>Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee and Managers Bruce and Rosewater made short talks, explaining the position of the committee in the matter.  They explained that there is no disposition on the part of the committee to belittle the live stock interests, but the action in providing for medals only was taken after careful consideration of the matter when there seemed to be no way of providing the money necessary for carrying out the cash premium plan.</p>
                            <p>The matter was discussed at length by a number of the directors, General Manderson adding to the arguments already advanced in favor of cash premiums and the resolution was then adopted without a dissenting vote.</p>
                            <p>The stockmen present were highly gratified at the result of the meeting and one and all prophesied that great good would result from it and that this action would result in bringing thousands of people to the exposition who would not come had the decision been otherwise.</p>
                            <p>On the heels of these expressions of satisfaction General Manderson for the Union Stock Yards company of South Omaha said the company would contribute $1,000 in cash, to be awarded in prizes by the executive committee for cattle, sheep and hogs.  This announcement was greeted with applause.</p>

                            <p>"I believe there are more people in Omaha today than ever before in the history of the city," said Assistant Postmaster Woodward this morning.  "The postoffice is the best index of the growth or decline of population, and there are now more names on our list than we had in the palmiest days of the boom.  We are adding from 150 to 300 new names per day, which represents but a fair percentage of the total influx.  We are already pushed to keep up and must soon have additions to the force."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Woodward had just returned from the exposition, and reports that arrangements for the branch there are about completed.  It will be a thoroughly equipped and complete postoffice, with register and money-order departments and five carriers.  The postmaster has not been chosen, but will be taken from the city office.</p>
                            <p>Word came from Washington that the exposition stamps will be ready in a very few days.  Many orders for them are already on file at the postoffice.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Business of the Association on the Grounds to Be Carried on by a Single Responsible Head Hereafter.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Resolved, That a general manager, to be selected by and be under the direction of the executive committee, be placed in charge of and held responsible for the orderly, economical and systematic conduct of affairs on the exposition grounds and be in full charge thereof; suggesting to the executive committee such general rules and regulations or changes therein as may produce the best results.  Such general manager shall have the power, for cause, to summarily remove and discharge any employe of the exposition employed in the buildings or on the grounds of the exposition, except superintendents of departments, and shall immediately report his action in that behalf and give the cause for such discharge to the manager of the department in which such person is employed.</p>
                            <p>The course which has been urged on the exposition management for months has at last been adopted, and the first step has been taken to place the administration of the affairs of the exposition in the hands of one man with executive authority.  This action was taken by the Board of Directors of the exposition at a prolonged and stormy meeting held yesterday afternoon, which ended with the adoption of the above resolution by a vote of 34 ayes and 1 nay, the latter being cast by Director Yost, who laughingly remarked that he simply "wanted to be different."</p>
                            <p>This matter came up after the board had been in session for some time, being broached by Mr. Weller, who said there was a vexed question which should be settled, as it seriously threatened the very existence of the exposition.  He then offered the following resolution and moved its adoption:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the members of this board cordially endorse the appointment of A. C. Foster to the position of general superintendent made by the executive committee in compliance with resolutions adopted November 13, 1897.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the executive committee is hereby directed to broaden and enlarge the powers of the general superintendent, who shall be placed in full charge of the exposition grounds and buildings and held responsible for the orderly, economical and systematic conduct of affairs in and on the same, subject to such rules and regulations as may from time to time be made by the executive committee with a view of producing the best results.  The general superintendent shall have the power, for cause, to summarily discharge any employe of the exposition employed in the buildings or on the grounds, excepting superintendents of bureaus, and shall fill the vacancies.  Any superintendent of a bureau may, for cause, be suspended by the general superintendent, who shall immediately report his action to the manager of the department in which said superintendent is employed, and in case charge of misconduct are sustained, the manager of said department shall name a substitute for said superintendent to the executive committee for confirmation.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Lindsey and Montgomery Object.</head>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee opposed the resolution.  He declared that the members of the executive committee were competent to discharge their duties and he regarded the resolution as a direct affront to the committee.  If anything was wrong, he said the committee would be glad to have the matter investigated, but he asserted that it was not in the power of any one man to conduct the exposition and the effect of the resolution would be detrimental.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson demanded to know in what way the resolution reflected on the executive committee, to which Mr. Lindsey replied that it would result in putting a man over the heads of the members of the committee.</p>
                            <p>Director Montgomery denounced the resolution as an attempt to do away with the executive committee, and said if he were a member of the committee he would resign.  He designated the proceedings as an attempt to discharge people and said if an executive head was what was wanted the president should be delegated power to exercise the authority.  He charged the supporters of the resolution with ulterior motives in thus urging the enlargement of the powers of Mr. Foster and declared the Foster was all right in his present position, but would be all wrong if his powers were extended.  The matter had been laid on the table at a previ-<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Mr. Weller disclaimed any intention of reflecting on the executive committee, but he said matters had reached a stage where something should be done.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater replied to the statement of Mr. Montgomery that the matter had been laid on the table at a previous meeting and thus disposed of.  He called attention to the fact that what had been laid on the table was a report of the opposers of this resolution, providing that the position of general superintendent should be abolished.  This had been laid on the table by the votes of the people who made the report, thus presenting the spectacle of the signers of a report voting to lay it on the table.  He declared that such action was simply an evasion of the issue and appealed to the directory to look the matter squarely in the face.  He charged that certain of the employes holding responsible positions had been found to be guilty of serious offenses and yet the exposition was dependent upon these same employes to carry along the business of the enterprise.  He also referred to certain difficulties with outside states which had resulted from the hydra-headed method of doing business which prevails.  So far as Mr. Foster is concerned, Mr. Rosewater said he had not particular interest in seeing him retained or in seeing any other man placed in the position, but he declared that a crisis had been reached and if prompt action was not taken those connected with the exposition would see the time in the near future when disgrace would envelop the entire enterprise.</p>
                            <p>Manager Bruce resented the remarks of Mr. Rosewater and declared that such statements made it imperative that the whole executive committee resign.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mr. Hitchcock's Opinion.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock made an impassioned argument, in which he charged that the whole scheme was a deliberate and premeditated purpose to seize the patronage of the exposition and get it into single hands.  He charged that for months Mr. Foster had been personally canvassing the members of the board to override the executive committee and secure greater power.  He denounced such a course as an outrage, partaking of petty politics for an employe who took the position for the wages it offered to attempt to secure more power for the prestige it would give him in the approaching campaign.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson challenged the statements of Mr. Hitchcock.  He said he knew very little of Mr. Foster personally, having met him but a few times, but he said he had had a private conversation with him early in the current week and he quoted the conversation at length, showing clearly and conclusively that Mr. Foster not only had not sought the enlargement of his powers, but that he shrank from the additional burdens which such enlargement would thrust upon him.  General Manderson then said he took exceptions to the wording of the resolution which had been offered, and he offered as a substitute the resolution which he had offered at the last meeting, making a few changes in the wording of it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Weller accepted the substitute and after the resolution had been discussed briefly it was adopted by the vote heretofore stated.  Messrs. Babcock, Bruce, Lindsey and Rosewater of the executive committee were present and all voted for the resolution.</p>
                            <p>When the meeting opened Secretary Wakefield asked the indulgence of the meeting while he read a statement from John Rush, formerly auditor of the exposition, and Robert Finley, the present auditor, both to the effect that they had checked the accounts of the secretary's office, Mr. Rush's checking extending up to the time when he left the service of the exposition, and Mr. Finley's extending from that date to the present time.</p>
                            <p>The secretary then called attention to a half-bushel basket of protests against the opening of the exposition gates on Sunday.  He said this contribution had just been received, but there were several more half bushels on file in his office and he asked for instructions as to their disposition.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson said the question of Sunday closing was an important one and ought to be settled.  The people opposing the opening of the gates on Sunday were making a most aggressive campaign and the matter should be taken up and disposed of.  For himself, he said he believed that in the interest of morality the exposition should be kept upon on Sunday.  He moved that the executive committee be instructed to report to the next meeting of the board regarding the custom expositions regarding this question.  This motion was adopted.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Free Pass Question.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee submitted a report on the free pass question referred to the committee at the last meeting of the board.  The report stated that the committee had adopted the following resolution as its recommendation on this matter:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the board of directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition that there shall be no free list or passes to the exposition after June 1, except as follows:  Officers and members of the executive committee, executive committee of the Bureau of Education, executive committee of the Bureau of Entertainment, vice presidents and commissioners of nations, states and territories, executive officers of nations, states and territories; exhibitors, concessionaires, employes in the actual discharge of their duties, newspaper representatives as per rules previously adopted, mayor and city council of the city of Omaha, Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, Board of Education, Board of Park Commissioners, Board of County Commissioners, sheriff of Douglas county.</p>
                            <p>It is the intent of this resolution that no stockholder or director shall be provided with free admission except as above stated.</p>
                            <p>The reading of the rules governing the issuance of passes to representatives of newspapers was called for and Manager Rosewater explained that these rules contemplated the issuance of a large number of passes, but they were in the nature of an exchange of courtesies for which the exposition received full return.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson favored the reduction in the number of these passes, but Mr. Rosewater explained that such policy would be detrimental to the exposition and do more harm than good.  Many of the passes might never be used, but even if every editor took advantage of the opportunity the exposition would receive much more than their value in advertising.</p>
                            <p>This opinion finally prevailed, and then the directors took up the latter clause of the committee's resolution and it was discussed at some length, the burden of the arguments being that the directors had assumed the responsibility for the exposition and had given their time and attention to it and should, therefore, be entitled to consideration.  After an extended discussion the clause was removed and the directors were added to the list of those entitled to receive passes.</p>
                            <p>At the instance of Director Hoctor an attempt was made to add to the list the mayor and members of the city council of South Omaha and Council Bluffs, but the amendment was defeated.</p>
                            <p>The next meeting of the board will be held on the exposition grounds Saturday, May 21.</p>

                            <p>From present appearances there is no doubt but what the opening day of the Transmississippi Exposition will see the completion of all the main buildings, together with the installation of the exhibits.  Many seem surprised at the apparent slowness in the arrival and installing of exhibits, but the latter is one of the minor factors.  Of course the exhibits are not to be slighted in their arrangement, but more rapid progress is made in this particular than in the erecting of booths.  The exhibits have to a great degree arrived in the city, and are in storage awaiting the completion of booths in the various buildings.  A spirit of friendly feeling seems to pervade among the large mass of humanity now engaged on the grounds.  The work goes merrily on without the slightest friction of any kind.  The pleasant weather of the last six days has added to the great progress.  The grass seems to daily shoot up from the ground and already the lawn mowers have been pressed into service on almost all parts of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>One of the most beautiful sights to greet the nightly visitors  will be the lagoon and main court.  This is to be lighted entirely with incandescent electric lights, a feature which has never before been undertaken at a like event, because it was thought impossible.  Counting those which project from the buildings there will be 8,156 incandescents, with a combined power of 163,120 candles.  They will throw a yellow-like or golden light, casting no shadow, and will make the court as light as day.  The electric light decorations on the lagoon have been so arranged as to form a circle.  No two of the buildings have been decorated alike.  Seven lines of light will extend in circle fashion from the pillars of the Government building to the dome of the same.  Nine batteries will form as many different lights for the electrical fountain in the west end of the lagoon and almost any contrast known can be formed by it.</p>

                            <p>Small plants and rose bushes are being set out at different positions about the main court and on the Bluff tract, which will soon give the appearance of a veritable flower garden.  The work on the Horticulture building has reached that degree where the trash has been removed and the setting out of bluegrass sod commenced, which is to abut the foundation of the building.  The California exhibit will occupy almost one-third of the building to the east.  Already Frank Higgins, who has charge of the exhibit, has taken charge and will lose no time in arranging the extensive display.</p>
                            <p>The Utah agricultural and mining exhibits have arrived, but in a rather dilapidated condition.  Mr. Whittaker, the superintendent for Utah, who has been at the grounds for several days arranging booths, received a telegram Wednesday night that a misfortune had overtaken his exhibits at Rawlins, Wyo.  Sparks from the engine set fire to the car containing the exhibits and before the fire could be extinguished it had badly damaged them.  The exhibits arrived yesterday over the Union Pacific and they look badly.  Some of the agricultural selections were entirely consumed by the fire, while a number of the cases for the mining department were badly damaged by the fire and water.  The greatest loss was the model of the state house building of Utah, which was valued at $2,000.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Concessionaires Go Into Court to Get an Answer to This.</head>
                            <p>Two concessionaires of the Transmississippi Exposition, assisted by their attorneys, occupied the time and attention of Judge Fawcett all of yesterday afternoon and they will do the same thing again today.  It is over the question of which has the right to exhibit movable pictures at the exposition.  Each man contends that he has the exclusive right and Judge Fawcett is called upon to decide if such is the case and if not, which has the contract.</p>
                            <p>E. M. Bayliss brought suit against the Transmississippi and International Exposition association, enjoining it from awarding a contract to Henry Roltair to exhibit movable pictures by aid of a projecting machine.  Roltair intervened and then the issues were joined.  Bayliss says that originally he had a contract to exhibit an illusion to be known as "Night and Morning," the thing to be in the form of a four-story pyramid in which there were to be numerous scenes, including a cafe where winged females, intended to represent angels, would serve food and drinks.  In addition to this there was to be an apartment where his satanic highness would torture his subjects and make things lively for the wicked caught within his domains.  This scheme fell through and then his contract was modified so that, according to his version, it would include the exhibit of movable pictures, one of which he says is to be a representation of the harbor of Havana, the city, the surrounding country and the destruction of the Maine.</p>
                            <p>It is right at this point where the two concessionaires clash.  Roltair contends that he has the exclusive contract for the production and projection of pictures showing the situation in Cuba and the destruction of the Maine in the harbor of Havana.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Object Lesson Showing the Revolution Wrought by Which it Became Possible to Supply Europe with Pig Iron.</head>
                            <p>Dr. David T. Day, mining commissioner for the exposition, is rejoicing over the fact that the arrangements have been completed for an excellent mineral exhibit from Alabama.  Negotiations have been pending for a long time for a mineral exhibit from the state which has, within the last few years, taken a prominent place in the mining world, but no satisfactory conclusion could ever be reached.  Efforts were made to induce the state to make an appropriation, but these proved unavailing, as did efforts to accumulate a fund through individual efforts.  Dr. William B. Phillips of Birmingham, a man prominent in mining affairs in the south, was recently appointed honorary commissioner of mining for the state by the exposition and through his efforts and that of the Commercial club of Birmingham an exhibit is now assured.</p>
                            <p>"The exhibit which will be made by Alabama," said Dr. Day, "will show the reasons why that state has been exporting pigiron to the old country&#8212;a thing which, even up to five years ago&#8212;was regarded as impossible for all time.  It will show the natural mineral resources of the state, and especially the Birmingham district, showing how the near proximity of fuel, flux and ore enables that section to produce iron at less cost than any other section in the world.  This ability to produce pigiron at a minimum cost, together with the exhibit of Minnesota, showing how iron ore is produced cheaper than anywhere else, will form a strong object lesson.</p>
                            <p>"The exhibit from Alabama will not be confined to iron alone," continued Dr. Day, "but will include other industrial minerals, including building stones and clay products.  This display is made possible by the energy of Dr. Phillips and the Birmingham Commercial club.  The exhibit will form a carload, and Dr. Phillips will accompany it to look after its installation."</p>

                            <p>Every mail brings to the Department of Transportation bills of lading, which are positive evidence that from every quarter of the country exhibit are enroute to the exposition.  Hundreds of carloads of material are on the way of Omaha, to be placed in the magnificent buildings prepared for them <choice><sic>an dto</sic><corr>and to</corr></choice> assist in making up a display which will be a marvelous collection of the products of the soil and the factory.</p>
                            <p>All of this material will arrive in Omaha before the middle of <choice><sic>hte</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> coming week, and, with the exhibits already in the buildings, will make the entire exposition grounds a center of activity beside which the ancient beehive will sink into insignificance <unclear reason="torn"/> example <unclear reason="torn"/> of men will be employed in setting up the booths and installing the multitude of exhibits.  In the case of commercial exhibits the booths are shipped to the grounds all ready to be erected and their assembling is the work of but a few hours.  A corps of decorators and assistants will accompany each exhibit to put it in place and these men will constitute an army of no mean proportions.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="124" xml:id="TMISB04-124"/>
                            
                            <p>The exhibits which arrive in carload lots are switched directly to the grounds, where the cars are set on track in the rear of the building in which the exhibit is to be placed.  The material is then unloaded by the local transfer companies having the concession for this work and placed on the space assigned to the exhibitor.  Where exhibits are not extensive enough to fill a car several are consolidated in one car at the downtown freight depots and switched to the grounds, where the same process follows as in the case of carloads.</p>
                            <p>The floor in each building is marked with broad white lines showing the boundaries of the several spaces, and each space is marked with the number of the exhibitor to whom the space is assigned.  The labels on the goods are marked with the exhibitor's number and all confusion is thereby avoided.  This system was devised by the Department of Exhibits, and has been most conducive to order and expedition.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Woman's Board of Mangers has decided that the individual competition being conducted under the auspices of the board shall be closed May 20.  This competition is for the purpose of inciting the children to renewed efforts in the line of their school work, and inducements in the shape of medals in all classes for the best work are supplemented by the announcement that the work winning a prize will be given a place in the exposition.  This competition has been held open longer than was at first intended on account of the fact that the children have been pushed by the demand for extra work for the state exhibit, but it is now announced that the lists will positively close May 20 and no further entries will be received after that date.  Mrs. Keysor, Mrs. Reed and Miss McHugh have been appointed a committee to select the judges in this competition.</p>
                            <p>It has also been decided to have a formal opening of the Girls' and Boys' building some time during June.  The exact date has not been fixed and the ceremony will not interfere with the occupancy of the building before it occurs.  The building is under contract to be completed ready for occupancy June 1 and it will be occupied at that time, but the formal dedication of the structure will not occur until afterward.  President Sawyer, Mrs. Reed and Miss McHugh constitute a committee to arrange for the details of the ceremony.</p>
                            <p>The congress committee of the Woman's board has appointed the local committee for the Congress of Literature, comprising Ben. H. Barrows, chairman, Mrs. W. H. Hanchett, Miss Margaret Boyd, W. H. Alexander and Dr. Leo Franklin.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">TWO EXPOSITION PROBLEMS.</hi></head>
                            <p>The exposition management has overcome many obstacles that seemed almost insurmountable and has brought the enterprise to a point that assured its success as one of the greatest expositions every projected for this or any other country.  For this the executive committee, which has had the laboring oar in financiering, promoting and organizing the enterprise, is justly entitled to credit.</p>
                            <p>At this stage, however, when the construction period is almost completed and the great task of active supervision of the daily operations on the grounds entered upon, the concentration of authority in a single competent head is conceded to be imperative.  Whether this officer be called director general, general manager or general superintendent, he must be held responsible for the good order and efficiency of all the subordinates and employes on the grounds.  No man can perform this duty without full power to enforce his orders by summary dismissal, if necessary, of insubordinates, incompetents and men guilty of dishonest practices.  Any obstruction to the creation of such office is as subversive to the interests of the exposition as is any attempt to prevent the checking up of the exposition books by a competent expert accountant.</p>
                            <p>In other words, second only in importance to the appointment of a director general is the appointment of a comptroller or auditor entirely independent of both treasurer, secretary and any manager of the executive committee just as the United States treasury is entirely independent of the treasurer and the secretary of the treasury himself.</p>
                            <p>It is a matter of grave concern to those informed of the fact that the so-called auditors of this great corporation have been simply clerks under the secretary, who is also practically acting treasurer.  The fact that the books are being checked from day to day by a clerk called an auditor does not warrant the assumption that they are being audited in the true sense of the word.  Although more than $500,000 has been handled under this loose system, it is no reason why a reform should not be at once inaugurated when the gates are about to be opened with the expectation of receipts amounting to over $1,000,000 coming in from various sources.</p>
                            <p>The appointment of an auditor by the full directory would materially strengthen the credit of the exposition and help the executive committee in its efforts to float a temporary loan.  It would also relieve the executive committee from a grave responsibility which should not be imposed upon it.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Postoffice Department Gives the Special Issue Its Official Name and Description.</head>
                            <p>Yesterday the Department of Publicity and Promotion received a telegram from Washington to the effect that the exposition stamp issue would be printed in one color.  It had been the intention of the Postoffice department to use two or more colors in order to bring out the design more forcibly and to lend to each denomination a peculiar individuality.  Owing to the extra time required for printing this was abandoned and now each stamp will be in one solid color, the different denominations to be of different hues.</p>
                            <p>Third Assistant Postmaster General Merritt is out with a circular, under date of April 21, to the postoffices of the United States, some 160,000 odd in number, making arrangements for the new stamp.  It will be known as the "Omaha issue."  The circular says:</p>
                            <p>To accomplish the distribution of these stamps a requisition form, "3201&#8212;Omaha," printed on yellow paper will be furnished all postmasters upon their request to the first assistant postmaster general after May 1 next.  Presidential postmasters will receive copies of this form before that date.  This new form may be used for ordering any postal cards or stamped envelopes desired with the Omaha stamps, but ordinary stamps of the 1894 series, now being issued, will not be furnished on the new form of requisition mentioned above.</p>
                            <p>There is no issue of Omaha cards or stamped envelopes.  The adhesive form is the only description of Omaha stamped paper will be issued.  The issue of these stamps will cease at the end of the calendar year, December 31, 1898, but they will be good for postage indefinitely.</p>
                            <p>The denominations of the Omaha stamp will be the 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 50-cent and the $1 and $2, making a complete set of them cost $3.80.  The department will issue soon a complete description of the stamps.</p>
                            <p>All the requisition and return forms for the Omaha stamp have been received at the Omaha postoffice.  From the preparation made by the government it is evident the officials at Washington expect the regular series of stamps to be supplanted by the Omaha so far as its denominations go.  It is expected that by the first of June the sale will begin and from that date forward every letter sent throughout the world from a postoffice of the United States will bear an advertisement of Omaha and the Great Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 12.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The question of the Marine band going to Omaha has once more reached the president, Secretary Long of the Navy department  stating the Senator Thurston, who called upon the secretary in relation to the matter this morning, that he would not interpose any objection to the band's going in view of the fact that the exposition was of a national character as indicated by congress and President McKinley.  While there is no certainty that the band may be permitted to leave there is no doubt that progress is being made toward that end.</p>
                            <p>The Star states tonight that the president has authorized the Marine band to attend the National Exposition at Omaha solely because it comes under the rule which permits the band to attend occasions for which congress has made an <choice><sic>aprpopriation</sic><corr>appropriation</corr></choice>, and in this case congress has made an appropriation of $200,000.  This assertion could not be confirmed, but there is every reason to believe that it is true.  Director Santlemann is greatly pleased with the outcome of the matter and is ready to enter into a contract with the exposition management at a figure that shall be mutually satisfactory.  The band has not had such an extended trip since 1895, and has not been in Omaha since the spring of 1892, when it went there under the leadership of Sousa.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DISPLAY PROMISES TO BE OF THE BEST</head>
                            <head type="sub">Six Hundred Pictures Secured, Most of Which Are the Handiwork of American Artists, Some of Them Noted Paintings.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The installation of the pictures and works of art which will be displayed in the Art building at the exposition will be well under way with the beginning of the current week.  The beautiful building which has been erected as the home of the best work of American and foreign artists is practically completed and the corps of assistants working under the instruction of Art Director Griffiths will take full possession.  All but a very few of the pictures have been received and the warehouse downtown where they have been stored is groaning with the plethora of wooden cases containing the priceless gems sent here for exhibition by the artists or by the owners, who have kindly loaned their treasures for the occasion.  There will be only about 600 pictures in the entire collection, Director Griffiths and the committee of the Western Art association having charge of the art exhibit having proceeded on the theory that the available space should be filled with works of the very highest grade.  Hundreds of pictures were available, but from among the very large number offered the best were selected, with the result that the art display of the Transmississippi and International Exposition will compare very favorably with any art exhibit that has ever been held in this country.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">Display by American Artists.</head>
                            <p>A feature of the art display will be the work of American artists.  Special attention has been devoted to making the exhibition largely American, and when the pictures are all in place the names of the artists will appeal strongly to the patriotism of visitors.</p>
                            <p>Among those whose pictures will be in the collection is William Howe of Philadelphia, an artist whose standing in Europe is such that his pictures are admitted to the far-famed salons of Paris without being first passed on by a jury.  He may be called the Rosa Bonheur of America, his work being confined to painting animals.  He will exhibit two cattle pieces.</p>
                            <p>William T. Richards of New York has achieved fame as a painted of marine scenes and he will exhibit two marines of more than usual excellence.</p>
                            <p>Alice P. Barney, a society woman of Washington, D. C., who paints because she loves the art, has yielded to many requests and will exhibit a work she calls, "In My Looking Glass."</p>
                            <p>John Alexander of Pittsburg, an American artist who has received more medals than he knows what to do with, will have a piece entitled "A Yellow Girl," a very striking portrait of a beautiful young girl in a brilliant yellow gown.</p>
                            <p>George Wharton Edwards, another painter of marines, will contribute a "Fog Bell on the Maine Coast," a very strong piece of work.</p>
                            <p>Paul de Sar of Indianapolis, a young American who studied in Paris, where he acquired a great reputation, and whose second picture shown in the salon was purchased by the French government, is one of the very few artists who will have more than two pictures in the collection.  One of these is a very strong picture entitled, "The Departure of the Fishermen."  The scene is laid on the French coast, showing the boats in waiting, and a group of men and women in the background performing a simple religion ceremony invoking the Divine blessing upon the departing fishermen.  In the foreground are two children and the breadth of feeling displayed in the treatment of these two figures would assure the lasting reputation of the artist if he never painted anything else.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Handy with the Brush.</head>
                            <p>Kenyon Cox of New York, an artist whose work is gaining for him a wide reputation both at home and abroad, contributes an allegorical painting of exceptional beauty and excellence entitled "Science Instructing Industry" and a portrait of Mrs. Cox.</p>
                            <p>William H. Haberle of New Haven is one of those care-taking individuals who paint $5 bills and newspaper clippings so true to life that people insist on trying to pick them from the canvas.  A number of his paintings of money have been confiscated by the government because they were counterfeit.  He has agreed to send a picture he calls "A Bachelor's Drawer."  It has not arrived, but will undoubtedly be found to be a freak of fancy.</p>
                            <p>Charles Grafty of Philadelphia contributes an original plaster model which has attracted great attention wherever it has been exhibited, and received honorable mention at Paris.  It is a figure of a young girl, perfectly nude, standing on the sea beach.  With one hand she holds to her ear a sea shell and the whole pose of the figure, the closed eyes, the evident concentration of the whole thought on the news being whispered by the shell, all tell a story of youthful faith in the message from the sea.</p>
                            <p>The list of meritorious works of art might thus be continued almost indefinitely, but the assurance is doubly certain that the visitor to the art exhibit of the exposition will be fully repaid for the hours which will be spent in the study of the many beautiful things there displayed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Judge Fawcett Decides the Movable Picture Concession Suit.</head>
                            <p>Judge Fawcett will allow H. Roltaire to exhibit angels, Egyptian pyramids and all kinds of stationary pictures at the exposition, but he will not permit him to infringe upon the concession of E. M. Bayliss and put on movable pictures.</p>
                            <p>There was trouble between two concessionaires, Roltaire and Bayliss.  They took their troubles into court, where the latter named concessionaire won.  Roltaire secured a concession to erect a pyramid four stories in height, in which he was to have a representation of his conception of heaven and hell.  He was to have a heavenly cafe, where meals were to be served by waitresses clothed in fleecy apparel and supplied with wings.  These females were to float around among the clouds, and then they were to hover over the tables, finally alighting among the guests, serving them ordinary home cooked dishes.  Later on Mr. Roltaire concluded that his heavenly cafe would not prove a winning card and he concluded to put on movable pictures in its stead.  Just prior to this Bayliss appeared before the exposition management and secured a concession to exhibit movable pictures, including the harbor of Havana, the destruction of the United States battleship Maine, together with the scenes immediately <choice><sic>preceeding</sic><corr>preceding</corr></choice> and those immediately following.  To this Bayliss protested and thus the matter got into the courts, where he contended that Roltaire was infringing, or was about to infringe, upon the rights granted him under his contract with the exposition.  On these points raised the court heard testimony and then handed down an opinion, finding for Bayliss and against Roltaire.</p>

                            <p>According to the code of ethics governing exposition no Midway would be complete without an exhibition of living pictures, and the Midway of the Transmississippi Exposition is to be no exception to the rule.  A building has been commenced on the West Midway by Dunnavant &amp; Thompson, which will shelter an exhibition of living pictures under the pseudonym of "Visions of Art."  The building itself will be a novelty on the spectacular order.  The front will present the appearance of a huge dragon with wide open mouth through which entrance will be had to the interior.  Spreading wings back of the head will measure sixty-five feet from tip to tip and the glittering eyes will be balls of fire which will roll and change hue in a most realistic way.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Wong Aloy Secures a Concession and Begins Work.</head>
                            <p>The difficulties which have surrounded the Chinese commissionership of the exposition have at last been adjusted, and Wong Chin Foo has dropped out of sight and the mantle falls upon Sing Nam from New York.  Sing has organized a company of which he is the president and a number of his fellow countrymen are said to be stockholders.  This company has assumed the rights and privileges forfeited by Foo and energetic preparations have been commenced to make up for the time lost in waiting for Foo's option to expire.</p>
                            <p>According to the terms of the contract between Foo and the exposition he was given until April 30 to commence construction of his building and complete the final arrangements for making his exhibit.  As soon as his time expired, without any action on his part to comply with his contract, it was declared forfeited and negotiations were opened with the parties who have now succeeded him.</p>
                            <p>The Sing Nam company has entered into a contract with Leo Bonet to construct a building on the bluff tract in which the Chinese exhibit will be made.  The building will be pushed with all possible speed and will be completed within fifteen days.  The goods and merchandise purchased in China by the agents of Foo will arrive shortly and it is expected that the Chinese exhibit will be entirely ready when the exposition opens.  Thirty people attached to the exhibit have been in the city for some time, and the balance of the large company of artisans, mechanics, artists, etc., are on the way.</p>
                            <p>The management of the exhibit will be in the hands of Wong Aloy, an enterprising descendant of Confucius, who promises that it will excel anything that has hitherto been attempted in this direction.  According to Wong Aloy, the enterprise of which he is the manager is backed by a number of Chinese merchants of wealth who intend to take advantage of the opportunity thus offered to introduce into this country several lines of manufactured products which have never been handled here.  These goods will be manufactured on the exposition grounds by skilled workmen, and will include all lines of commodities, a specialty being made of numerous varieties of food in the preparation of which the Chinese claim to excel.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Starts to Carry Out His Often Expressed Determination to "Bust" the Union and the Expected Walkout Follows.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Dion Geraldine has finally forced a strike among the carpenters at the exposition grounds.  How far it will extend cannot be stated at this time.  Indications are, however, that it may become serious unless the exposition management takes a hand and brings about an adjustment of the difficulties.</p>
                            <p>At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon a walkout was instituted by order of the Building Trades union on account of the employment of scab labor.  The trouble has been brewing for some time and was not entirely unexpected by the union men.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine has been doing contract work for different concessionaires, his present work being on the Japanese tea garden and Streets of Cairo, where the strike was precipitated.</p>
                            <p>When he was awarded the contracts representatives of the Building Trades union waited upon him in regard to his attitude toward the union and the employing of union men.  He was known to be antagonistic to the union, and had at different times made the board that he had "busted" the union in Chicago, and would do the same thing in Omaha before he was through.  During the course of conversation with the trade's representatives he gave them to understand that if he was let along and allowed to have his own way the union would receive fair treatment.  The conversation ended with this assurance, but Geraldine broke his promise from the very beginning.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Lets Out Union Men.</head>
                            <p>After his work had progressed for a time he dismissed his union foreman and hired a nonunion man, which was something very hard for the union carpenters to swallow.  This was followed by the dismissal of a number of union men and the filling of their places with nonunion, which precipitated the trouble yesterday.  Before the call was issued for the strike, Geraldine was waited upon, but denounced the union in strong language, and said that he would "bust" it all right yet.  Not being able to secure even a satisfactory hearing, the union men were at once notified to quit work.  The order affects every member of the Building Trades union employed on the exposition grounds.  The carpenters engaged on the band stand under Contractor Mahoney refused to quit at the call, and their job was forthwith dubbed "scab."  There was some talk among the strikers of forcing the men to quit, and in anticipation of trouble, the police were telephoned for.  The men were not molested and they kept on with their work as though nothing had happened.  It is said that charges will be instituted at a called meeting against these men who refused to go out on the call.</p>
                            <p>By this strike nearly 300 carpenters are affected and unless the matter is settled by Monday every union laborer on the grounds of every trade will be called out, which will suspend work temporarily altogether.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Busby Tries a Bluff.</head>
                            <p>Busby, Geraldine's foreman, declared that he would "fix" any union man who opened his mouth to him.  Directly after the union men walked out and by apparently preconcerted action the workmen on adjacent buildings to the number of at least 100 laid down their tools and walked over to where Mr. Busby stood.  He endeavored to overawe them by placing his hand on his hip pocket as if to draw a revolver.  The workmen surrounded him, seized him, threw him down and in rather a good natured manner searched him to see if he had a gun.  He was not injured, but given sufficient humiliation.</p>
                            <p>W. H. Bell, a local labor leader, was asked as to the probable results and the attitude of organized labor in the matter.  "The whole trouble lies with Geraldine," said he.  "He has boasted from the inception of the work that he would 'bust up' the unions.  After his exposure by The Bee and his deposition he proved the truth of the charges the labor unions and The Bee made against him by immediately assuming personal charge of various contracts in which it had been asserted he was interested.  He first employed union labor because it stood him in hand to do so; now that the end is approaching his animosity is asserting itself.  He put on a lot of scabs and when the union leaders waited upon <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The Hawaiian exhibit will occupy 3,000 square feet of space in the main building of the exposition and will include a complete line of the products of the island.  A feature will be made of the agricultural products of the islands, including sugar in all stages of manufacture, rice, all kinds of vegetables, the taro root and various other products for which the island is famous.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shingle writes that he will arrive in Omaha about May 26 and promises that his exhibit will be an exceptionally fine one.</p>

                            <p>The second official circular of the Transmississippi Educational convention has been issued and is now being thoroughly scattered over the transmississippi territory.  It is a four-page pamphlet, which contains all the information in regard to the enterprise brought down to date.  The first page contains the personnel of the organization, the second and third are devoted to the program of the various departments and the last page refers to the various advantages for the comfort and entertainment of visitors, including the exposition, railway and hotel rates, halls and general entertainment.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">A COMPTROLLER NEXT.</hi></head>
                            <p>The directors of the Transmississippi Exposition have acted wisely in creating the position of general manager, on whom shall develop the supervision of employes in and about the exposition grounds and buildings.  In this they have cast no reflection upon the executive committee, but have only followed out the example of every other great exposition.  The action would have been taken months ago but for the disinclination of the directory to run counter to the expressed wishes of a majority of the executive committee, who, for reasons not yet explained, have sought to continue a mode of administration manifestly impractical.</p>
                            <p>Now that the question of the creation of the general manager's office has been disposed of, the next thing imperatively demanded is the creation of the office of comptroller.  As at present organized the functions of secretary, treasurer and comptroller are centered in one and the same man.  The secretary receives and receipts for money and signs the vouchers that are cashed on presentation to the treasurer without any other check.  In reality, therefore, the treasurer acts merely as a depository which receives the exposition funds on deposit and pays them out on order of the secretary.</p>
                            <p>The so-called auditors of the exposition have never been anything but bookkeepers, acting under direction of the secretary.  The assurance that the exposition books have been balanced from time to time by the so-called auditor, therefore, counts for nothing.  It simply certifies to the fact that the credits and debits as recorded in the books equal one another.  It is an entirely different matter to have each voucher scrutinized by an officer independently responsible and in no way subordinate to either the secretary or treasurer.</p>
                            <p>In a word, the exposition needs a comptroller, without whose endorsement no vouchers shall be good.  This officer is the more necessary now when the exposition is about to issue hundreds of thousands of dollars in warrants and bonds and when probably more than $1,000,000 will be turned in from gate receipts and concessions.  No corporation doing such a large business would think of permitting one man to receive, handle and pay out its revenue without intermediate check.  This is particularly true of public corporations or quasi-public <choice><sic>orporations</sic><corr>corporations</corr></choice> like the exposition.  It is not a question of confidence in the present officers, but simply requiring that strict business methods shall be pursued by the exposition.</p>

                            <p>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, CITY OF OMAHA, May 14.&#8212;Whereas, In the year 1895, the duly accredited representatives of the transmississippi states and territories in convention assembled declared in favor of preparing a great exposition which should display to the world the matchless energy, the splendid thrift, the resourceful ingenuity and the high degree of intelligence of the people of the transmississippi region, and the unrivaled products of the fertile soil, the rich mines and the busy mills and factories of the great west; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, These representatives decided that the city of Omaha was the most favorably located and most representative city in the transmississippi states, and the one best qualified to arrange and carry out plans for such an exposition; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, With untiring energy and unsurpassed ability our exposition directory has carried to successful completion, the arrangements for the accommodation of the exposition, and the great buildings of splendid architectural design, are now receiving and arranging the various exhibits; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The gates of the exposition are to be formally opened to the world on June 1, 1898, with appropriate exercises, which will be witnessed by many thousands of people from this state and other states;</p>
                            <p>Now, therefore, I, Frank E. Moores, mayor of the city of Omaha, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, June 1, 1898, a public holiday, and request that all schools, stores, factories and offices of the city be closed upon that day, and that every person in the city, with unrestrained enthusiasm, celebrate this important event, which opens a new era of commercial and industrial prosperity to the city of Omaha, to the transmississippi states, and to our beloved country.</p>

                            <p>LINCOLN, May 14.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;Governor Holcomb today issued the following proclamation:</p>
                            <p>To the People of the State of Nebraska: The beginning of a new epoch in the history of the transmississippi country, and especially of Nebraska, will be marked by the opening of the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha, the first day of June, the present year.</p>
                            <p>This great enterprise had its inception in the action of the Transmississippi congress of 1895, attended by accredited delegates from twenty-four states and territories.  To the end that friendly ties and closer commercial relations might be promoted between the different states and territories, and that the progress of this great section of our country and its marvelous opportunities might be displayed advantageously, it was determined to hold an exposition of the products and resources, the manufactures, arts and industries of the west at Omaha during the present year.  With a high appreciation of the responsibility imposed, as well as the honor conferred, by the selection of its metropolis as the place of exhibition, the people of Nebraska, and especially of the city of Omaha, have spared neither effort nor money in doing their part to make the exposition a success.  The state, by legislative appropriation, and citizens, by generous contributions, have made possible the wonderful achievements in making this enterprise, as it will be, one of the great expositions held on American soil.  A new city has sprung up as if by magic on the outskirts of the Nebraska metropolis and for five months its wonders will attract visitors from every section of our country, from every quarter of the globe.  The gates are ready to be thrown open.</p>
                            <p>Now, therefore, I, Silas A. Holcomb, governor of the state of Nebraska, do hereby designate and proclaim Wednesday, June 1, A. D. 1898, a public holiday, and denominate it</p>
                            <ab>EXPOSITION DAY.</ab>
                            <p>To the ceremonies attending the opening of the magnificent display of the progress of the transmississippi country, it is hoped many people from throughout the country will come, and especially do I request and urge that all citizens of Nebraska, who may conveniently do so, be in attendance on this occasion, by their presence showing their interest in the enterprise, and assisting in making the day memorable in the history of the state.  The importance of the exposition, and the responsibility resting upon every citizen of the state to support it to the extent of his ability is, I am confident, fully appreciated by all.</p>
                            <p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused to be affixed the great seal of the state of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Done at Lincoln, this fourteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, the thirty-second year of the state, and of the independence of the United States the one-hundred and twenty-second.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Assistant Postmaster Woodard has forwarded to Washington the special requisitions for the Omaha stamps and they are expected to arrive in a few days.  Orders for them continue to pour in from all parts of the country.  One local firm sent in a check for $1,000 and asked immediate delivery of that value in one and two-cent denominations.</p>
                            <p>The news series are said by the postal authorities to be the most beautiful and artistic ever issued.  They differ materially in size from the ordinary series, the engraved space being about seven-eighths of an inch wide by about one and three-eighths long.  The designs are also radically unlike the ordinary stamps, consisting of a border substantially the same in all the denominations except that the colors and the figures and letters representing values are different and a central scene in black indicative in some way of the development of the great region beyond the Mississippi river.  The scenes and the borders are all printed from lined engravings on steel by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the Treasury department.</p>

                            <l>Following is a description of the stamps:</l>
                            <p>"The border which forms in its inner line an irregular framework to the scenes represented consists of a fluted figure on either side with interior crossbars beginning in a single line near the bottom of the stamp and enlarging until it reaches a shield in each of the upper corner wherein is engraved in white the Arabic numeral of denomination&#8212;the dollar mark being included in the case of the $1 and $2 stamps.  At the top, connecting the two <choice><sic>shieldsand</sic><corr>shields and</corr></choice> united to the flute framework on the two sides, is a curved tablet on which are engraved in small white capitals the words "United States of America."  Above this on either side are heads of wheat and between them a small scroll.  Immediately below the central space is the title of the picture in diminutive white Gothic letters on the curved tablet and below this on either side in scrolls are the words of value, "One," "Two," and so on in white capitals except in the case of the two highest denominations when "$1.00" and "$2.00" are substituted for letters.  At the bottom of all on a straight black tablet are the words "Postage, one cent," "Postage two cents," and so on, in white capitals.</p>
                            <p>The scenes represented on the stamps together with the colors of the borders of the several <choice><sic>dnominations</sic><corr>denominations</corr></choice> are as follows:</p>
                            <p>One cent&#8212;"Marquette on the Mississippi," from a painting by Lamprecht now in possession of the Marquette college of Milwaukee, Wis., representing Father Marquette in a boat on the upper Mississippi preaching to the Indians.  Color of border dark green.</p>
                            <p>Two cent&#8212;"Harvesting in the West," <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Four-cent&#8212;"Indian Hunting Buffalo," reproduction of an engraving in Schoolcraft's "History of the Indian Tribes."  Color of border, copper red.</p>
                            <p>Five-cent&#8212;"Fremont on Rocky Mountains," modified from a wood engraving, representing the Pathfinder planting the United States flag on the highest peak of the Rocky Mountains.  Color of border, dark blue.</p>
                            <p>Eight-cent&#8212;"Troops Guarding Train," representing a detachment of United State soldiers convoying an emigrant train across the prairies, from a drawing by Frederic Remington, permission to use which was given by the publisher, R. H. Russell of New York.  Color of border, dark lilac.</p>
                            <p>Ten-cent&#8212;"Hardships of Emigration," from a painting loaned by the artist, A. G. Heaton, representing an emigrant and his family on the plains in a "prairie schooner," one of the horses having fallen from exhaustion.</p>
                            <p>Fifty-cent&#8212;"Western Mining Prospector," from a drawing by Frederic Remington, permission to use which has been given by the publisher, Mr. R. H. Russell of New York, representing a prospector with his pack mules in the mountains searching for gold.  Color of border, orange/</p>
                            <p>One-dollar&#8212;"Western Cattle in Storm," from a large steel engraving of a picture by J. MacWhirter, loaned by Mrs. C. B. Johnson, representing a heard of cattle, preceded by the leader, seeking safety from a gathering storm.  Color of border, metallic red.</p>
                            <p>Two-dollar&#8212;"Mississippi River Bridge," from an engraving; a representation of the bridge over the Mississippi at St. Louis.  Color of border, copper red.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Officials All Interested.</head>
                            <p>The Washington authorities have been much interested in the designs.  Every one had a finger in the pie.  Mr. Roosevelt would have a buffalo and wild warfare.  The buffalo and the army picture were selected.  Mr. Roosevelt also wanted Custer at the head of a troop of cavalry, but no picture could be found.  Mr. Merritt selected the harvesting scene.  Mr. Gray insisted upon the Rock Island instead of the St. Louis bridge, but as the former was neither picturesque nor costly, and the small town of Davenport would have been portrayed as a leading western city, Mr. Gray was ruled down.  Mr. Gray also insisted upon having the St. Louis bridge upon the two-cent stamp instead of at the end of the series, where it properly belongs.</p>
                            <p>The designer of these stamps is Raymond Ostrander-Smith.  He was imported last July by Mr. Johnson from the American Bank Note company of New York.  His first piece of work is the postal which is now in use.</p>

Many new names were added to the roll of membership, including W. E. Wesland of Boston.  Mr. Wesland is prominently connected with the Boston Pilot, one of the oldest papers in the United States.  He spoke in the highest terms of the exposition and stated that the people of New England are much interested in the progress shown by the western states in the mammoth display of their products and resources proposed by the management of the enterprise.  Jeremiah Howard, Joseph A. Connor, M. J. McMahon, Dr. McCrann and J. E.

                            <head type="sub">Youngsters Who Subscribed to the Girls' and Boys' Building Fund Propose to Have Their Stock Issued.</head>
                            <p>A mimic revolution is impending among the school children of this immediate vicinity over what they regard as the unreasonable delay in the issuance of the certificates promised to all who subscribed $1 or more to the fund for the erection of the Girls' and Boys' building.</p>
                            <p>Early in November last strenuous efforts were made to arouse the interest of the children of this entire section in the idea of contributing their mites to the fund for the construction of this building and patronesses were appointed for the various schools and everything the women could think of was done to induce the children to contribute.  Among other things it was promised that each child subscribing for twenty shares at 5 cents each should receive a handsome certificate of stock.</p>
                            <p>The dollars rolled in from all directions and each juvenile subscriber at once proceeded to wait for that handsome certificate of stock.  Six months and a half of waiting with no signs of realizing on the numerous promises proved too much even for juvenile patience and the youngsters have almost lost faith in the oft repeated promise that the certificates "will be ready in a few days."</p>
                            <p>Numerous inquiries at the office of Secretary Ford of the Woman's Board of Managers has elicited the information that the certificates are in process of being executed.  They were printed several months ago and it is possible that the <choice><sic>grotesquesness</sic><corr>grotesqueness</corr></choice> of some of the figures of the alleged cupids in the design may account for the hesitation in issuing them.  Some of these figures have had their legs detached by <choice><sic>acicdent</sic><corr>accident</corr></choice> or design and these nether extremities are hanging about in the vicinity of their rightful location in the funniest way imaginable.</p>
                            <p>These certificates require the signature of President Sawyer, Vice President Kimball and the seal of the board in addition to the name of the subscriber and the number of shares of stock purchased.  The clerical work involved in making them out is tremendous and no proper provision has been made for doing this work except to employ an Omaha teacher to fill in the names of the subscriber.  The office force of the secretary of the woman's board consists of two girls, and the ordinary work of the office is more than enough to keep them busy all the time.  The result is that the certificates are taken up at odd moments and the present indications are that these certificates will reach the subscribers in time to form cumulative evidence in the stories told to their grandchildren about the great exposition "when grandpa was a boy."</p>
                            <p>The teachers in the public schools who received the contributions are having some difficulty in convincing the pupils from whom they collected numerous dollars that the money reached the proper place and that the certificates will be forthcoming in that dim and misty future.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Department of Transportation Finds Its Busy Season Almost at Flood Tide Under Present Conditions.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>A number of <choice><sic>pesimistic</sic><corr>pessimistic</corr></choice> individuals about town have been predicting all sorts of calamities in connection with the exposition because the exhibits <choice><sic>hwere</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> not coming in fast enough to suit them.  They declare that the exhibits are not coming, that the exposition will not be ready, etc., in season and out.  If these same individuals are "keeping tab" on the grounds and the departments as closely as they think they would be surprised at the flood of material which is coming into the city from all points of the compass to form the exhibits which will make the Transmississippi and International Exposition an epoch in <choice><sic>thehistory</sic><corr>the history</corr></choice> of the world.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Transportation has now become one of the very busiest departments of the exposition.  Every mail brings in bills of lading by the score.  These come from every section of the world and include every imaginable commodity.  A very large proportion of these bills of lading represent a carload of goods in each case, and the rate at which these carloads of exhibits are coming may be imagined when it is known that one mail this morning contained nineteen bills of lading, fourteen of them being for carloads of material.  Of the latter two represented a portion of the state exhibit to be made by Georgia.</p>
                            <p>As in all commercial transactions, these bills of lading arrive several days in advance of the goods they represent, and as soon as they are received at the office of the department at the grounds&#8212;Major John McClintock.  The full cars are switched to the grounds as soon as they arrive in the city and are checked through the warehouse of the Transportation department and delivered at their proper location.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Portion of Menagerie Comes.</head>
                            <p>Hundreds of men and scores of teams are engaged in unloading the goods as fast as they are received and gangs of men take them in hand for installation as soon as they are placed on the space assigned to the exhibitor in the proper buildings.</p>
                            <p>Among the bills of lading which arrived at the downtown office of the Transportation department this morning was one for a carload of material, constituting a portion of the exhibit to be made by <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> Page Woven Wire Fence company.  This exhibit is to be made on the north tract, and will consist of a fence constructed of the particular brand of fencing manufactured by the exhibitor.  To show the efficacy of the fence, and, incidentally, to attract the attention of the people, several wild animals are to be displayed within the enclosure.  The bill of lading in question conveyed the information that the car contained twenty-eight rolls of wire fencing, together with the following:  "One buffalo, crated; one elk, crated, two bears, crated."</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Owens of the Transportation department was thrown into a state of mind when he grasped the situation, and he rushed frantically into the office of Manager Babcock to ask what would be done with the wild animals while the fence is being constructed.</p>
                            <p>"These are the wild animals," exclaimed Owens excitedly.  "<choice><sic>Wecan't</sic><corr>We can't</corr></choice> let them run around loose and it would never do to keep them in those crates until the <choice><sic>fenceis</sic><corr>fence is</corr></choice> finished.  If we put them in the freight warehouse what will Major McClintock do with the other freight?"</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock was looking over some official correspondence while the stenographer was looking for some information for Park Commissioner Wharton, who had been consulting with Mr. Babcock.  The latter glanced up from the papers before him and thoughtfully bit his moustache for a moment while he thought.</p>
                            <p>"Ah, I have it!" he exclaimed in an instant.  "We'll let Wharton hold them," and he surveyed the burly form of the park commissioner with a smile of satisfaction at the easy solution of the whole difficulty.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exhibits Department and Woman's Board Take Up New Quarters.</head>
                            <p>The Exhibits department has now taken up its permanent headquarters on the exposition grounds and the offices in the Paxton block occupied by the department for over a year are now vacant.  The removal includes Superintendent Hardt, all the superintendents of bureaus of the Exhibits department, and the office force of the Woman's Board of Managers, including the secretary, Mrs. F. M. Ford, and all the clerks.</p>
                            <p>The headquarters of the department are now in the southwest corner of the Manufactures building.  The south gallery from the main entrance pavillion to the west end of the building, has been divided into office rooms by partitions ten feet in height and these rooms will constitute the headquarters of the department until after the exposition is over.  Mrs. Ford and her force of clerks is occupying one of these rooms temporarily, but will remove to the Liberal Arts building, of which she had direct charge, as soon as a suite of rooms in the gallery of that building is ready for occupancy.</p>
                            <p>The removal to the grounds was effected Sunday and Monday morning found the activity which has heretofore pervaded the headquarters in the Paxton block transferred to the grounds with greatly increased vigor.  Exhibitors by the score who were prevented by the urgency of their preparations from storming the down-town office, took advantage of the changed conditions to besiege the new headquarters and the daily increasing crowd of belated applicants for space insisted on filing their applications.</p>
                            <p>It always happens in all expositions that a large number of exhibitors of a dubious turn of mind fail to profit by the teaching of the old adage regarding the early bird and the worm, and when the exposition movement turns into the home stretch these belated individuals always want to climb into the band wagon and get a front seat.  The present exposition is no exception to this invariable rule and the would-be exhibitors are simply falling over one another to grab the few spaces remaining unsold in <choice><sic>osem</sic></choice> of the buildings.  In many of the buildings there is not another foot of space to be had for love or money, and the few small spaces remaining unsold in the other buildings are being grabbed up like hot cakes on a cold day.</p>
                            <p>Added to the confusion resulting from the demands of all these people to be heard at once is the noise of the hundreds of hammers and says being wielded by the workmen preparing the scores of booths in the big building.  The combination results in a continuous noise which would make a boiler factory blush for shame.  The telephone in the office of the department is well nigh useless on account of the tremendous racket.  Major Clarkson tried to communicate with the officials through the telephone and insisted that "central' had connected him with some Cuban port, as he "could hear Sampson's guns bombarding the Spanish forts."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee Reports Progress Being Satisfactorily Made.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi Educational Congress met at the Commercial club today with Messrs. Utt, Gillan, Jackson and Pearse in attendance.  Mr. Utt of the transportation committee reported that the railroads had granted a reduction in the fare to the exposition congress, making it one fare plus $2 for the round trip from all points as far east as Milwaukee, Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis and as far west as Ogden and Huntington.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Gillan of the entertainment committee reported that the badges had been received and were being rapidly sent out, and that halls for the various conferences had been practically all secured.</p>
                            <p>State Superintendent Jackson reported that from indications the funds from badges and other sources would be sufficient to cover all expenses incidental to the conference.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hearse of the program committee said the programs were nearly all completed.</p>
                            <p>The reports from various sections indicate that the interest is widespread and increasing and that the congress will be most successful.  One county superintendent of schools in Madison county, this state, has sent for 100 badges, one district in Colorado for twenty-five&#8212;which are simply sample cases, but indicate slightly the probabilities of a very large attendance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Dr. Day Will Make it a Complete Educational Exhibit.</head>
                            <head type="sub">REPRESENTATIVE OF A GREAT INDUSTRY</head>
                            <head type="sub">Intended to Show the Natural Resources of the Country with the Process of Reducing the Ore.</head>
                            <p>The mining exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition will be, as far as possible, a complete exhibition of the economic mineral resources of every state west of the Mississippi river.  The fundamental objects of these exhibits will be to show every mineral substance which has been produced in commercial quantity, and by the character of the specimen to indicate the condition in which each useful mineral substance is found in nature.  Then the different processes of extricating the useful material, whatever it may be, from the crude ore, will be shown.  In addition to this, an effort will be made to familiarize the public with the appearance of the chief mineral localities, the geological conditions under which the minerals themselves are found in each locality, and the character of the smelting features will be illustrated by maps and by either photographs of water colors.</p>
                            <p>Utah, Montana and Nebraska are the only states for which there are state appropriations for a mining display, but by individual subscriptions, Kansas, Oregon, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, Alaska, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Washington, Oklahoma, South Dakota and California will be represented by systematic collections made by state commissioners.  In addition to these, the mineral resources of Texas, Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana and North Dakota will be shown by exhibits obtained by Commissioner Day from individual producers in these several states.  While it is impossible at this early date to give detailed descriptions of the exhibits from each state, it may be said in general that special attention will be paid rather to a complete showing of such minerals as have proved of economic value than to make glittering displays of useless minerals, as has been done before.  Perhaps the greatest revelation of the display will be the great resources of the west in such important minerals as clay, building stone and coal, rather than to leave the whole exhibit to tell simply a tale of the western stores of precious metals.  The coal exhibits of Kansas, Oregon, Montana, Utah, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas and even North Dakota and Nebraska will be greater than have ever been made before.  A convenient comparison with the eastern deposits will be made by one or two typical exhibits of eastern coals, such as the very large specimens <choice><sic>elready</sic><corr>already</corr></choice> installed of anthracite from Mauch Chunk, Pa.  In clay exhibits, the resources of Nebraska will perhaps be most striking, it not generally being known that there are over one hundred producers of bricks, tiling, terra cotta, fire brick and other products of clay in Nebraska alone; but in regard to the precious metals, the effort to show the production of gold will be phenomenally great, the large store of nuggets and gold from Alaska are being collected, one exhibit alone containing a specimen from every camp in Alaska.  The state of Washington is determined to preach a sermon to the effect that that is a gold state, and Oregon will endeavor to teach the same lesson.  This will be done not only by showing specimens from that state, but by actually bringing supplies of placer dirt and panning it out at short intervals all through the exposition.  The process of gold extraction from refractory ores will be shown quite thoroughly from an exhibit from the Black Hills of South Dakota.</p>
                            <p>A large portion of the gallery will be set aside for a lecture hall for illustrations of various processes of extracting precious metals from their ores, and conventions of mining men will be held during the exposition.  The rest of the gallery will be chiefly devoted to loan collections of minerals and exhibits from the United States geological survey and a series of metallurgical exhibits indicative of the progress in that line since the World's fair, and as this will include a fine showing in the manufacture of carborundum, calcium carbide, etc., this portion of the building will probably be most attractive of all.  Perhaps the most striking feature of the whole building will be a collection of the gems of the west.</p>

                            <p>The opening ode of the exposition, a composition written expressly in honor of the opening exercises, has been received from the publisher and will be taken up by the Omaha chorus tonight.  The ode is entitled "Song of Welcome."  The words are by Henry M. Blossom, jr.., of St. Louis, Mo., and the music is by Mrs. H. H. A. Beech, an American woman who has achieved distinction in the ranks of American composers and who is spoken of by Theodore Thomas as the greatest woman composer in the world.  The words of the ode are as follows:</p>

                            <head type="sub">LATEST STRIKE IS SOON SETTLED.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Carpenters All Back at Work Except on Geraldine's Contracts.</head>
                            <p>The strike among the carpenters at the exposition grounds has to all appearances reached an end.  The work on the various exposition and concession buildings was resumed yesterday morning as though there never had been any interference.  The carpenters who walked out Saturday afternoon were found at their former places, excepting on the Geraldine job.</p>
                            <p>It is said among the prominent contractors that the union has already seen that it was hasty in requesting its members to walk out on the various jobs.  The whole difficulty, being with Geraldine, there is where it should have stopped.  The union accomplished its purpose in stopping his work, and after a conference of the executive committee it was thought best to let the matter rest there.  It was said that had the union ordered a general strike yesterday morning, as anticipated, the men would have rebelled and refused to do so.  As it is, the matter has been settled so far as all the work, separate from Geraldine's, is concerned.</p>
                            <p>As early as 4 o'clock in the morning carpenters may be seen at work on the exposition grounds.  The band stand is under construction to be completed by the last of next week and Contractor Mahoney has three crews of men.  The first goes on at 4 a. m. and works until 12 m.; the second commences at 8 a. m. and quits at 5 p. m., while the third begins at 5 p. m. and closes at 9.  The large arc lights which are being used on the bluff tract afford ample light for the work and several of the contractors will soon begin to use a night crew.</p>

                            <p>KANSAS CITY, May 16.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The horticultural resources of Missouri may not be represented at the Omaha Exposition.  Arrangements had been made to have there an exhibition worthy of the state, but it was learned a few days ago that the terminal charges in Omaha are so exorbitant that to send small consignments of fruits and berries to the exposition every day would soon eat up the money subscribed for this purpose.  The committee on horticulture of the Missouri commission met at the Coates hotel this morning with J. R. Rippey, secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, and before making final arrangements for an exhibit, discussed at length the matter of terminal charges.  As a result a subcommittee, composed of W. F. Murray of Oregon, president of the State Horticultural society; L. A. Goodman of this city, A. Nelson of Lebanon and G. A. Atwood of Springfield, will go to Omaha to look into the matter and try to make arrangements so that these charges will be eliminated.</p>

                            <p>The sea water for the tanks in the aquarium of the Fish commission exhibit in the Government building where the ocean fish are to be displayed has arrived.  The water came in a tank car such as is used for transporting oil, the tank containing 15,000 gallons.  This water was pumped into the reservoir beneath the floor of the Government building and the tanks for the ocean fish will be filled with it.  The ocean fish are expected to arrive the latter part of the month.</p>
                            <p>The fresh water fish will commence arriving the latter part of the present week.  As has been stated heretofore, these fish will come from many different sources and the car of the Fish commission will be obliged to make a number of trips before all the different varieties are placed in the tanks which are to form their homes for the next five months.  The ocean fish will be brought in last of all.</p>

The books of views which will be issued will contain photographs in colors, marking an advance in the science of photography which has only recently been attained.  In this connection Mr. Rinehart has arranged with W. H. Jackson, formerly of Denver, to take the pictures with a special process.

                            <head type="sub">Director Griffith and His Assistants Making Ready Wonderful Display.</head>
                            <p>The exhibit of paintings to be made in the Fine Arts building promises to be one of the best ever shown to the public.  For two days Director A. H. Griffith and a corps of assistants have been busily engaged in unpacking and taking an invoice of pictures already received.  This work will continue for several days, as the exhibits are arriving daily.  Mr. Griffith has been delayed considerably by the building not being finished, but his work can now be pushed rapidly forward.</p>
                            <p>Among the pictures already unpacked and ready to be hung are a number by quite prominent artists.  Probably one that will attract more attention from the visitors than any other will be "A Bachelor's Drawer," by John Haberle, from New Haven, Conn.  Just at a glance this painting would not likely attract more than a passing notice, as it very closely resembles the collection of articles that seems to be merely pasted on a background, and consist of paper money, lid of a cigar box on which the revenue stamp is scratched, a half-smoked cigarette, cigarette paper and pictures, stamps that have been torn from letters, theater seat checks, a valentine, matches, playing cards, pen-knife, pipe, shoestring, eye glasses and the key to the drawer.  In fact it contains everything that might be found in a bachelor's knick-knack drawer.  These articles are reproduced perfectly and one needs to study the drawing to get its worth.  Mr. Haberle was arrested and three of his paintings at the World's fair confiscated by the government authorities on account of the reproduction of the money, which was designated a forgery.  There are also contained in the picture several newspaper clippings, which leads one to believe that it is a forgery.  This is really one of the masterpieces that will be on exhibition.</p>
                            <p>The Century Magazine company of New York sent its series of black and white drawings, which have been reproduced in the magazines at different times.  "A Siesta," by Frank Duveneck, from Cincinnati, will come in for its share of praise from sight-seers.  "The St. Louis Museum," by Julien Dupre, is a grand production.  Vandyke's "Four Ages," loaned by the Detroit Art Museum, is a magnificent sketch, and, in fact, ranks first among those to be on exhibition.  "In the Field" and "Her First Day at School" are also well known paintings that are on exhibition.  "An Evening in the Cafe," by Braugwyn, is another painting familiar to the devotees of art, and one that many are interested in seeing.  The hand of David Col will be seen in the presentation of his masterpiece, "The Wrangle," depicting a quarrel at a gambling table.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Space Secured Next to Nebraska in Agricultural Building.</head>
                            <p>Ex-Governor S. B. Packard of Marshalltown, a member of the Iowa Exposition commission, is in Council Bluffs and in company with Secretary F. N. Chase visited the exposition grounds yesterday afternoon, where he held a conference with J. B. Dinsmore, manager of the live stock, dairy and poultry department.  Mr. Packard's mission here is for the purpose of arranging for the live stock and dairy exhibit that Iowa will make at the exposition.  Secretary Chase and Mr. Packard arranged for space in the Agricultural building for Iowa's agricultural exhibit.  They secured 1,200 square feet at one of the four corners in the center of the building next to the space allotted to Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>All the members of the Iowa commission are expected to be here June 1 for the opening of the exposition and will then make arrangements for the dedication of the Iowa building for some day toward the end of that month.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Packard said that few people in Iowa were aware of the scope of the exposition or the magnificence of the different buildings, some of which in his opinion excelled those of the World's fair.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Colonnade to Be Roofed with Climbers, While the Terrace Will Be Lined with Lovely Blossoms and Bright Foliage.</head>
                            <p>The colonnades and pavillions forming the exedra at the east end of the main court are practically completed, a few finishing touches only remaining to be completed and the florists have taken possession of the wide flower beds inside the sweeping curves of the colonnades.  Shrubbery, rose bushes and foliage plants are being planted here in great profusion, and the boxes extending along the tops of the colonnades are being prepared for the vines which will twine gracefully about the white columns and form a leafy canopy over the trellis work, forming a roof for these colonnades.  The crescent shaped bed, midway of the grassy slope at the east end of the lagoon is being filled with flowering plants and handsome foliage plants are being placed at the inner side of the wall which encloses this same slope.  The combination of all of these beds of flowers, the white colonnades with the trailing green vines and the towering pavillions rising in stately grandeur above the rippling water of the lagoon will form a picture of charming beauty and make this portion of the main court one of the most entrancing spots among the many beautiful places on the grounds.  The unsightly scaffolding about the colonnades has been removed and the pleasing contrast of the white and green, mingled with the neutral tint of the paving rests the eye and exerts a soothing influence.</p>
                            <p>With the exception of the narrow strip of ground within the proper limits of Twentieth street boulevard where it passes through the main court, the latter portion of the grounds now presents a finished appearance and is about ready for the inspection of visitors.  All of the main buildings in this section of the grounds have been completed, the Girls' and Boys' building being the only exposition building being the only exposition building still in course of construction, and the walks have been completed at Twentieth street.  The delay in this spot is due entirely to the contractor for the iron bridges which are to be thrown across the lagoon at this point.  These bridges are now well under way and the moment the trusses are placed in position the work of filling the approaches and laying the walks will be pushed to completion.  The big trusses for the bridge from the north side of the lagoon to the island are all in place and the grading and paving is under way on this side, but the south bridge is far from completion and nothing can be done by the graders and pavers until the trusses are removed from their present position near the Arch of States.</p>

                            <p>While in New York City recently City Attorney Connell found one warm advocate of the Transmississippi and International Exposition in the person of Chauncey M. Depew.  There was a big electrical exhibition in progress in Madison Square garden and Mr. Connell was there at the opening exercises, which were attended by over 20,000 people.  Speaking of the opening exercises he said:  "The first thing on the program was a telegram from President McKinley, wishing the affair a success.  This was followed by a telephone message from Vice President Hobart, after which Chauncey M. Depew was introduced as the principal speaker of the evening.</p>
                            <p>"After some preliminary matters had been referred to," added Mr. Connell, "the speaker of the evening dwelt at some length upon the victory of Rear Admiral Dewey, relating the fact that the first information of the great sea fight came over the wires and that electricity made is possible to receive the facts a few hours after they occurred.  After that he referred to the conditions in Spain, comparing them with affairs in the United States, drawing a pleasing comparison.  During his speech Mr. Depew paid a great tribute to the Transmississippi Exposition.  He referred to it as being held in one of the greatest cities on the American continent and closed by saying that it would be an exposition that would be second only to the World's fair."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Architect Saunders Arranging with Local Contractors for Its Erection.</head>
                            <p>Preparations for the erection of the Washington building on the bluff tract have been commenced, and the most expensive state building on the grounds will be pushed to completion at a rate which will discount all the other states.  Charles W. Saunders of Seattle, member of the firm of Saunders &amp; Lawton, the architects who designed the Washington building, is in the city for the purpose of making arrangements with a local contractor to erect the building.  Mr. Saunders will personally supervise the work and the material is now on the road from the coast.  The lumber in the building has been donated by leading firms of the state and the structure will constitute an exhibit of the lumber resources of Washington.</p>
                            <p>The building on the ground is 50x100 feet, exclusive of the four corner features which project, forming a low-tower effect.  In only one respect are the abnormal sizes of timber growth to be employed in carrying out the design, and these will be the bases of the columns supporting the porch over the main entrance.  The rest of the material used will be in practical commercial sizes.  The lower courses in the curtain walls are to be of very wide planks, probably forty-eight inches, and above these will be the siding used in ordinary house construction.  The four corner features will be built of logs.  The side walls will be ten feet high and the open truss work of the roof, which will exemplify the uses of large timbers in bridge building, will give the exposition room a height of thirty-two feet in the center.  The roof is one of moderate pitch and surmounted by a small, octagonal cupola that breaks the sky line and adds greatly to the general effectiveness of the whole composition.</p>
                            <p>The brackets of the front porch are constructed of ship's knees.  The windows are six feet from the floor and allow shelving about the sides of the main room.  At one end of the building a lecture room, 23x50 feet, is located, which will also be employed as a place for school exhibits.  The administration offices are over the main approach to the building and are reached by a gallery.  Toilet rooms and storerooms are conveniently located.</p>
                            <p>The spaces between the windows on the interior are to be paneled in woods native to the state in natural finish.</p>
                            <p>Estimating the value of the lumber for the building at the market rate, the building represents an expenditure of about $25,000.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Saunders says the exhibit to be made by the Washington commission will be a most excellent one.  Spokane alone has contributed $5,000 to the fund and other localities are responding generously, so that a sufficient fund is assured.  The mineral exhibit will be extensive and a strong showing will be made of the fish industry of the state.  It is on agriculture, horticulture and dairy products, however, that the greatest effort will be made.  Mr. Saunders says that <unclear reason="torn"/>s last year were m<unclear reason="torn"/> and <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The repairing of the plastering in the rotunda of the Nebraska building has been completed and the dome has been tinted to correspond with the other portions of the interior.  The drapery and furniture for the building have been made ready and as soon as the oiling of the floors is completed the decorations will be installed.  A large number of very artistic oil paintings have been received from Nebraska artists in all parts of the country and these will add to the general beauty of the interior decoration.  Miss Mellona Butterfield, the hostess of the building, has the decoration of the interior of the building in charge and she is greatly pleased with the outlook for a handsome effect.</p>

The remainder will be used for maintenance and current expenses.

                            <p>The office of the Exhibits department in the gallery of the Manufactures building is the most popular place in town.  From early morning of one day until the pale gray streaks over the Iowa bluffs announced the coming of another day there is a constant stream of people besieging the door opening into the office of Superintendent Hardt and clamoring for attention to their wants.  These people are would-be exhibitors who have awakened at the eleventh hour to the fact that the Transmississippi and International Exposition is a big thing, and they are tumbling over one another in the attempt to secure the little space remaining unassigned in some of the buildings.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Hardt is the hardest worked man on the grounds.  With a dozen men pulling at his coat tails and besieging him for information about this and that, he retains his equanimity in a wonderful degree and sends each one away with the information wanted or with an assignment of space, which must needs be satisfactory because it is the best that can be afforded.</p>
                            <p>The exhibitors who are thus coming in at the last moment are of the most desirable class&#8212;large manufacturing or commercial establishments, who are usually large exhibitors, but who failed or neglected to get in their application in due season.  In addition to these people exhibitors are coming in every day in large crowds and one and all <choice><sic>callat</sic><corr>call at</corr></choice> the office of the Exhibits department for a permit to occupy the space which has been assigned to them.</p>

                            <p>Among the latter class was T. K. Bruner, representative of the North Carolina Horticultural society, who arrived this morning with a large exhibit to be made by the society, representing the experimental farm conducted under state auspices at Southern Pines, N. C.  Mr. Bruner will be in charge of this exhibit, which will represent the results attained by the methods pursued at the farm.  The exhibit will be in the Agriculture building and will consist of a display of the various grains and preserved fruits grown on the farm, showing the results of experiments with various kinds of fruits, charts showing the methods pursued in the experiments ,the results, etc.</p>
                            <p>Another new exhibitor waiting for the completion of certain preliminary arrangements was the Winchester Repeating Arms company.  H. B. Dow, a representative of the company, direct from the factory at New Haven, arrived with the exhibit, a carload of boxes and cases, and was prepared to commence active operations installing his material.  Mr. Dow says the exhibit now piled in the Machinery building ready for installation will be the best ever shown by his company.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Streets of Cairo Alleges that Streets of All Nations Interferes with Its Rights on the Exposition Midway.</head>
                            <p>Two more Exposition Midway concessionaires have gone into court for the purpose of having their respective claims and rights adjusted.  This time the litigants are the Oriental Exposition company, by Leopold Bonet, its president, and Gaston Akoun.  The plaintiff is "head push" in the Streets of Cairo, while the defendant is the man behind the Streets of All Nations.  In an incidental way the Transmississippi and International Exposition association is made a defendant.  The hearing on the merits of the claims of the respective parties will come on before Judge Scott on Saturday morning of this week and in the meantime a temporary restraining order will prevent the Streets of All Nations from going on with its arrangements for making its exhibits.</p>
                            <p>As plaintiff, Leopold Bonet, president of the Oriental Exposition company, says that as long ago as September 23, 1897, the concession department of the exposition granted him the right to put on and operate during the continuance of the exposition an attraction to be known as the Streets of Cairo, where he would show people from Egypt, a street in the Egyptian <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Bonet, in his petition, further alleges that some months after securing his concession the exposition people granted a concession to Akoun and his associates, the purpose to be to exhibit a street where the people from foreign countries would be represented.  In this concession he contends that it was not the purpose of Akoun to show anything connected with Egypt.  Since then, he says, Akoun has changed his mind, and that he proposes to exhibit camels, donkeys, a wedding procession and people from Egypt.  He adds that if Akoun is permitted to do this it will infringe upon the rights granted under his concession and will materially injure his business.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Great Rush Among Exhibits Out at the Exposition Buildings.</head>
                            <head type="sub">MANY DISPLAYS NOW BEING ARRANGED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Carload After Carload of Goods Arrive Daily at the Grounds and the Work of Transfer Never Slackens.</head>
                            <p>But two weeks remain until the opening of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  Should the progress be as great during that time as it has been, there is no doubt but what the principal portion will be completed, and nearly all the exhibits in place.  Several of the state buildings will not be entirely completed.  The states of Minnesota and Washington will commence their building in a few days on contract to rush them.</p>
                            <p>The hundreds of visitors who daily throng the grounds, which are becoming more beautiful each day, are proving a splendid advertisement for the exposition.  These visitors come not only from different points of this state, but from all over these United States as well.  Their first sight of the buildings and grounds is one of astonishment, for they had not expected nor hoped for such a large showing, and are so well pleased they cannot refrain from spreading the news wherever they go.</p>
                            <p>Carloads after carloads of exhibits are standing on the exposition tracks and cannot be unloaded and unpacked too rapidly.  The working crews are being rushed with all their might, while the carpenters at work on the booths beat a merry <choice><sic>tatoo</sic><corr>tattoo</corr></choice> with hammer and nails, the saw singing a gleeful song.</p>
                            <p>The West Midway is a lively little city.  The high See-Saw is up.  During the last two days the Old Plantation and Ostrich Farm have been under way.  The camels are seen grazing on the campus every afternoon, while the Arab acrobats are putting in the time practicing.  New concession buildings are the order almost every day, and the visitor will be besieged on every hand.</p>
                            <p>To the north of the Midway, the Apiary building was completed yesterday and turned over to the superintendent.  Already the exhibitors are on the floor, eager to get everything in readiness for the opening day.  L. D. Stilson, superintendent of the Nebraska apiary exhibit, says his exhibit will be the finest ever shown in the state.</p>
                            <p>The Bluff tract continues to show marked improvements.  The band stand is assuming huge proportions and stands out prominently owing to its having a full sight from visitors on the Sherman avenue viaduct.  The Illinois state building was turned over to the janitor a week ago and is now being decorated.  This work will be completed this week, when the stat commission will arrive and take possession.  Together with that of Illinois is the completion of the Nebraska building, and the first day of June will see the state commissions established in both buildings.</p>
                            <p>A queer incident happened this week in connection with the Utah mining exhibit.  Among the various minerals to be exhibited are a bar of gold and silver and a bar of pure gold.  The former weighs 400 ounces and was shipped by express to L. W. Shurtliff, vice president of the Utah commission, in care of the First National bank of Omaha, Mr. Shurtliff not having arrived in the city.  That bar, the value of which is $1,800, was delivered by the express company to the office of the exposition manager in the Agricultural building and there it remained for three days, unguarded, and contained, as far as the managers knew, nothing of very great importance.  The bar of pure gold, weighing seventy ounces, the money value of which is $1,400, was delivered to Mr. Shurtliff at the exposition grounds yesterday by a messenger boy, who, as well as the express company, did not realize the risk taken in so delivering.  The metals came from the Eureka Hill Mining company, and Mr. Shurtliff is under bond for the safe keeping and return of the same.  They were deposited yesterday afternoon in the First National bank, where they will remain until the exposition opens.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Members Hustle to Build Up the Numbers and Arouse Interest.</head>
                            <p>The Illinois club met at exposition headquarters last night.  Although the attendance was small, the members were very enthusiastic over their work.  The object of the club is to promote a feeling of kinship among the Illinois people residing in Omaha as well as to look after the reception of Illinois visitors at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was called to order by the president of the club, E. Benedict.  After a verbal report from the chairman of the executive committee, a member of the committee appointed to secure members reported, saying that so far but little progress has been made.  There are over 1,000 native born Illinoisans in Omaha, and with those eligible to membership, who have lived in that state five years, it is expected the club can secure between 200 and 300 names.  The securing of members is considered the essential matter just at present, and in view of this the executive and membership committees were instructed to unite and report progress at the next regular meeting, May 25.  These committees will meet at the Commercial club rooms Friday noon for lunch, at which time they will decide upon the best means for work.  Several new names were added to the membership roll.</p>
                            <p>The club anticipates giving a dinner at the Commercial club rooms on the evening of May 30, at which time the members and other Illinoisans will be invited.</p>
                            <p>As June 21 is to be Illinois day, the club hopes to make it a time when all visitors as well as Omaha people may point to as one of the events of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>E. L. Danforth, secretary of the Minnesota state commission, is in the city to look after a good many necessary details in connection with the Minnesota state exhibit.  On the same train with him and on a special car came J. L. Greatsinger of Duluth, president of the Duluth &amp; Iron Range railroad and chairman of the Minnesota mineral exhibit committee.  A party accompanied the latter.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Danforth brought good news with him from the north.  He says all the money subscribed for the exposition exhibit is now in the commission's hands and that while Minnesota's complete exhibit will not be in place on June 1 it will all be installed in the state building by the middle of the month.  Work on the building will commence at once.</p>
                            <p>"The commission was somewhat delayed by the fact that the subscribed money was not paid in promptly, but it has it all now," he said.  "We are intending to proceed at once on the erection of our state building and that will be up and all the exhibits will be in it by the middle of June.  Then you will see a great show.  A portion of the exhibit will be in place by June 1."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Greatsinger has arranged for one of the most complete mineral exhibits that will be seen on the grounds.  All the mineral resources of the state will be shown and every appliance and means employed in the extraction of the minerals will be a part of the show.  He and his party took in the grounds today.  They leave the city tonight.</p>

                            <p>The Colorado Exposition commission is now in the last stages of preparation for the exhibit to be made by that state and reports in the Denver papers indicate that the commission is highly encouraged by the developments up to this time.  The mining committee has secured 3,000 feet of space in the Mining building and the commission promises to break the famous Colorado record for a fine exhibit of the mineral resources of the state.  Mrs. Shute is still working away at the horticultural exhibit and the other departments are reported as being in the best possible condition.</p>

These books have been meeting with a more vigorous reception during the last few days and a large number of them have been disposed of.  The books are in two sizes, one containing coupons good for 100 single admissions and costing $20, and the other size containing fifty admission coupons, the book costing $12.50.

The price of admission will be increased to 25 cents.  At present admission is charged to but one portion of the grounds, the main court, and here the price is merely nominal, being only 10 cents.  In view of the near completion of the work of preparation, it has been decided to close all parts of the grounds and increase the admission to the price named.</p>

                            <p>The headquarters of the executive department of the exposition will be in the Administration arch in the main court on and after June 1.  President Wattles has been authorized to incur the expense necessary in furnishing the suite of rooms on the main floor of the arch overlooking the main court and these will be fitted up in a manner comporting with the dignity  of the duties devolving upon the executive in entertaining distinguished visitors.</p>
                            <p>Alfred W. Downing, the mint expert from Philadelphia, arrived yesterday and is at work in the Government building getting his press in running order.  Mr. Downing has been in the government service at Philadelphia for thirty years.  He says the die for the official medal of the exposition has been made and the mint officials are awaiting measurement orders from him before completing it.  The press will stamp the medals and is to be used in no other capacity.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Manager Babcock Explains Mistake that Causes Much Grumbling.</head>
                            <head type="sub">ONE PLAIN RULE IS DISREGARDED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exhibits Billed to Individuals Will Not Be Hauled Free by the Railroads &#8212; Concessions Are Easy to Obtain.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Quite a hullabaloo has been kicked up during the last three or four days in connection with the receipt of freight at the exposition grounds.  Investigation shows that this trouble has its origin among those who have persistently, if not willfully, disregarded the plain rule of the exposition association.  The privilege of free shipment for the Nebraska exhibits and of free return for other exhibits was made by the railroads with the understanding that the exposition association would be responsible for the care of the consignments and that the integrity of each would be preserved by the responsible party.  Arrangements to secure these privileges were made and the prospective shippers all had due notice of the plans and the charges, together with explicit instructions as to how to ship in order to secure the rates.  It now appears that many shippers have paid no attention to these instructions, but are sending goods to freight depots billed to themselves or other individuals at Omaha, with the result that the railroads decline to accept them for free transportation, but insist on the prepayment of freight and terminal charges.  If the shippers who now make bitter complaint against the alleged exorbitant charges will only observe the plain rule and bill their goods to the Transmississippi and International Exposition association, they will receive all the benefit of the very liberal concessions the railroads have made, and will have their property taken care of by responsible parties at a minimum of cost.</p>
                            <p>Horticulturists who complain they cannot replenish during the season from time to time their exhibits are assured that the exposition association has arranged a plan whereby these exhibits may be kept up continually fresh, and at very little cost.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Complaint of Nebraska Men.</head>
                            <p>Complaints have been made at headquarters of the Nebraska Exposition commission concerning the alleged exorbitant charges which it is alleged are made by the railroads at points of shipment on all exhibits intended for the exposition.  This latter complaint has been a source of great surprise to these aware of the fact that the railroads have all agreed to transport free of charge from Nebraska points all exhibits excepting live stock.  The complaints regarding this matter came from Superintendent Johnson of the agricultural bureau of the state commission, <choice><sic>Sueperintendent</sic><corr>Superintendent</corr></choice> Jackson of the educational exhibit and Superintendent Whitcomb of the apiary bureau.  All stated that they had been notified by persons desiring to ship articles for exhibition that the shipment would not be received unless freight charges and terminal charges were prepaid at point of shipment.  This information was like a bombshell in the camp of the state commission and Secretary Campbell threw up his hands, declaring that such a course would bankrupt the state commission.  The protests applied especially to small shipments, the charges being reported as being $1,50 in each case for a small parcel such as a <choice><sic>couunty</sic><corr>county</corr></choice> collection for the educational exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The attention of Manager Babcock of the Transportation department was called to these complaints.  He threw light on the <choice><sic>matted</sic><corr>matter</corr></choice>, which puts it in an entirely different aspect.  With reference to the difficulty in connection with the shipments of material for the Nebraska exhibits, Mr. Babcock said the whole situation results from the fact that the shippers insist on billing the goods to the individual superintendents of the Nebraska exhibit instead of billing everything to the Transmississippi and International Exposition as required by all instructions issued by the exposition management.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Mistakes Made by Shippers.</head>
                            <p>The educational exhibits about which so much fuss is being made," said Mr. Babcock, "are shipped to Superintendent Jackson individually or as superintendent of the educational exhibit, and in some cases the county superintendent shipping the exhibit addresses it to himself at Omaha.  In the agricultural exhibit some of the material is addressed to Superintendent Johnson as head of the agricultural bureau of the Nebraska commission.  All these things are wrong and directly contrary to the most positive instructions issued again and again by the Transportation department.  The special rates made by the railroads require that the identity of the exhibits must be preserved and the exposition is bound to see that this is done.  The exposition being the responsible party, all shipments must be made to it.</p>
                            <p>"This whole matter was gone over very carefully several months ago and there is no excuse for a misunderstanding at this late day.  It was thoroughly understood that the usual terminal charge would be made on the Nebraska exhibits the same as on all other exhibits, but an agreement was arranged which would have done away with all difficulty if it had been followed.  The commissioners said they could not pay out any money, but were obliged to have everything paid by means of vouchers in the regular way, and I then secured an arrangement by which the express company having the concession for hauling the exhibits agreed to pay all terminal charges of the Nebraska exhibits and render bills for the same to the commission.  It was also arranged that the shipments from all parts of the state in small lots should be collected at the downtown depots and taken to the grounds in large enough loads to entitle the commission to the lowest rate.  Instead of carrying out these arrangements they have been violated on all sides, and the result it that the railroads are inclined to treat the exhibits as ordinary freight because the shipments are addressed to individuals instead of to the exposition.  There is nothing to prevent any person shipping all his household goods and effects as exposition exhibits if the roads should accept material billed to individuals."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Facilities for Small Shippers.</head>
                            <p>Regarding the reported trouble concerning the shipments of small packages for replenishing the various horticultural and other exhibits, Mr. Babcock said ample provision had been made which would be entirely satisfactory to all concerned.  The greater part of this material, he said, would be shipped by express, and arrangements have been made by which all of the express companies will maintain offices on the grounds and these companies have arranged with the American District Telegraph company to deliver all express matter billed to people on the grounds.  The charges to be made for this service will be only such as is made by the American District Telegraph company, the exposition having nothing to do with this matter, but Mr. Babcock said the charges would be reasonable.  For small packages which may be carried in the hand Mr. Babcock said these might be carried into the grounds by the consignee or by any delivery wagon driver.  In short, the aim of the exposition management, according to Mr. Babcock, is to give exhibitors every facility for making their exhibit without <choice><sic>leving</sic><corr>leaving</corr></choice> a series of extortionate charges.</p>
                            <p>"There was a slight disturbance on the grounds yesterday over an <choice><sic>expres</sic><corr>express</corr></choice> company attempting to unload goods on the ground and haul them to the space of an exhibitor.  They were very properly stopped from doing so, and other company or individual which undertakes to do the same thing will meet with the same treatment.  One of the conditions under which special rates were obtained for the exposition was that the identity of the goods must be preserved in order to get the benefit of free transportation on the return trip.  The exposition is responsible for this identity and is required to certify to that fact before the goods will be accepted for return to the original point of shipment.  If Tom, Dick and Harry are allowed to go to the grounds and unload goods and place them on the space of the exhibitor, how is the exposition to keep track of the goods and know that the same goods are returned?  The company having the concession for the hauling on the grounds is under bonds to the exposition for the proper performance of its duty and the strictest account is kept of all shipments.  This company is responsible to the exposition and the exposition is responsible to the railroads.</p>
                            <p>"There is a story back of this little encounter at the grounds," continued Mr. Babcock.  "The express company which attempted to do the hauling in question was one of the companies which submitted a bid for doing all hauling before any contract was made.  This company, with others, formed a combination to raise the price of service and the figures submitted by them, which I still have in my possession, are from three to four times as high as the charges now in force.  It was after all efforts had failed to break down this combination and lower the price that I induced the Merchants' Express company to come down to the figures now in force.  At that time the company which created the trouble on the grounds yesterday promised to make trouble and it seems the effort is now being made.  When the manager of the company was finally compelled to desist from his efforts to break <choice><sic>ito</sic><corr>into</corr></choice> the grounds whether or no he remarked that he was 'looking for trouble,' and it seems he found it."</p>

                            <p>The British-Canadian club held its regular weekly meeting in the exposition headquarters last night.  The chief object of the meeting was to determine on a suitable room to be used as headquarters where British or Canadian visitors might come on arrival in Omaha, register and be directed as to rooms, etc.  The committee on headquarters was supplemented by the president, who is to call another committee together and complete the arrangements and report at next regular meeting, May 26.  It was suggested that this was an opportune time to pass resolutions of sympathy and respect on the death of William E. Gladstone.  The president appointed a committee which immediately drafted resolutions to that effect and the same were ordered spread on the books of the club.  P. L. Forgan made a speech in which he said that he had the honor of being personally acquainted with Mr. Gladstone, and words failed to express the appreciation he had of the "grand old man."</p>
                            <p>The president requested the members to hand in the names of all Canadian and British papers, so that literature on the exposition might be sent them for publication.

A visit to this building convinces one of the progress that can be made as soon as the exhibits on the floor.</p>
                            <p>The General Electric company of Schenectady, N. Y., has just emptied a car of material in the Machinery and Electrical building and will make an exhibit the equal of which has perhaps never been seen.  The printers and pressmen who may visit the exposition will have the opportunity of seeing the progress made in presses.  The Miehle Printing Press company of New York will have a good exhibit, which has already arrived and is being placed in position.  The Dexter folder will also be another attraction.</p>
                            <p>The four colonnades which are to be the chief attraction in the Mines and Mining building are fast being completed.  The states of Utah, Colorado, Montana and Wyoming will make their exhibits therein, the like of which has never been surpassed.</p>
                            <p>Visitors are no longer permitted in the Fine Arts building on account of the great amount of work being done in the unpacking of paintings.  Director Griffith has been absent in Des Moines for several days, but the work goes merrily on in charge of Assistant Paul Charleton.  The French collection of paintings from New York City, consisting of sixteen boxes, was received and unpacked yesterday.  This collection equals half of the money value of the entire exhibit and Mr. Charleton has been kept quite busy visiting the city at intervals and placing insurance on the paintings as fast as they are unpacked.  The area between the two sections of the Art building is being sodded and beds of beautiful flowers and plants placed therein.  When completed it will be one of the prettiest spots on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>On the Midway the same bustle and hurry is noticeable.  Hundreds of workmen are striving with might and main to get the buildings completed and the attractions installed.  One of the novel features of the show at present is the work of the Chinese artisans who are erecting the Chinese village.</p>

                            <p>President F. M. Sterrett of the Missouri Exposition commission has sent a circular letter to the mayors of the principal cities in Missouri, to Governor Stephens and to the members of the commission, asking them to suggest a date for Missouri day at the exposition.  When these replies are received a day will be named by President Sterrett and Missourians will attend the exposition in force.  Arrangements are pending for the Apollo club and the St. Louis Amateur orchestra to come to Omaha on Missouri day.</p>
                            <p>The women's clubs of the state are taking an active part in assisting the state commission in preparing a state exhibit, their efforts being chiefly centered on the educational question.  All the woman's clubs of the state, of which there are about 100, have been asked to help and the manner in which they are responding, although not called upon until the last moment, is the source of great encouragement to the committee having this branch of the work in charge.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HOW THE MONOPOLY WAS CREATED</head>
                            <head type="sub">One of the Interested Men Gives a Short History of the Negotiations and the Result that Followed.</head>
                            <p>The expressmen who were arrested Wednesday for violating the rules of the exposition in hauling goods into the exposition grounds were yesterday discharged for lack of prosecution.  The independent expressmen are very much worked up over what they denounce as an attempt of the transportation department of the exposition to turn all of the exhibits over to a monopoly under the form of a contract with the official express company of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"The exposition is trying to freeze out all the small expressmen," said a representative of the independent expressmen.  "The public ought to be informed of the method by which the present situation has been brought about.  Back in January Manager Babcock invited all the principal expressmen of the city to a conference for the purpose of discussing arrangements by which the conditions exacted by the railroad companies could be complied with.  A preliminary proposition was agreed upon and signed by all the express companies, including the one which has been designated as official, limiting the number of teams to be used and specifying maximum charges.  This is what Manager Babcock now characterizes as a combine which he has broken up by making a contract with one member of the combine to monopolize all the business.  This proposition provided for a charge of $1 for small trips and 8 cents a hundredweight for general hauling.</p>
                            <p>"In February Manager Babcock asked expressmen to submit bids on exposition hauling, but a few days later withdrew the invitation owing, as he said, to the unsettled condition of the freight delivery proposition and promising to submit another set of specifications for further bids as soon as matters were adjusted.  The next thing we knew Manager Babcock had had himself empowered to make a contract for the nominal consideration of $1 for exclusive hauling of exhibits with a member of the exposition directory.  Naturally protests were entered against this arbitrary proceeding and the executive committee required a change in the contract giving the favored company under the title of 'official express company' an exclusive right within the grounds.</p>
                            <p>"The contract moreover provides rates higher than those suggested in the first conference.  The charge for small trips is $1, the same as in the memorandum, but the charge per hundredweight on goods hauled from local depots is increased from 8 cents to 12 cents per hundredweight, though the rate on hauling from the exposition terminal is reduced 2 cents, or from 8 cents to 6 cents per hundredweight.  The expressmen create a monopoly and let without consideration and without competitive bids, as having a right to get all the hauling exhibitors may give them and they are determined to resist all efforts of the exposition to make the official monopoly effective."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Roof Springs a Leak and by the Merest Accident Several Boxes of Exhibits Escape Being Damaged.</head>
                            <p>The damage done to the lagoon on the exposition grounds by the rains of Thursday was immensely added to by the heavy storm late yesterday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The sheet piling or retaining planking has been pushed in in several different places and in two places it is floating on the water.  The worst of these breaks is on the north side and toward the east end, where the piling for a distance of about 100 feet has completely collapsed.  The other bad break is on the south side running directly west from the bridge at the island.  The planking here was bent in by the rain Thursday and men were busy all day yesterday repairing it.  It is now in the water.  In five other places, mostly on the north side, the piling is giving way and may be forced entirely over before it can be pulled back.</p>
                            <p>The sheet piling is all anchored by wire cables to round piles driven in at the distance of twenty-four feet back from the edge of the lagoon.  The pressure of the earth moistened into the consistency of a thick mush like a bog has been so great as to break this cable in many instances and in others the anchor piles have themselves yielded.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall says that a large force of men will be put at work this morning repairing the damage.</p>
                            <p>It is hoped that the planking can be restored in time for the opening day, but it is feared that the water will have to be drained from the lagoon and much original work put in entailing an expense of several thousand dollars.</p>
                            <p>The roofs of all the chief buildings on the grounds leaked copiously during the downpour, but so far as could be learned last night no serious damage was done to exhibits only because they were not in place.  Some of the exhibits in the Agriculture and the Manufactures buildings got wet, but were not considerably injured.</p>
                            <p>The worst case of leak was in the Government building and mere chance prevented great injury to exhibits.  The small down pipes for draining the water from the roof of this building had no sort of adequate capacity to run the water down.  They filled up and overflowed on the roof and the water by the barrel full found its way through the lower part of the south side of the dome.  A stream poured in and filled a birch bark canoe suspended under the rafters over the apartment allotted to the Indian exhibits.  The chains holding the canoe gave way and the swamped craft came down.  It struck the floor with a great thump and splash in the aisle between rows of cases and none of the latter were touched.  The first report was that many of them had been smashed.  Captain Cox immediately went out from town on hearing the report, and meanwhile many of the government exhibit officials congregated at the Millard hotel to await the report he would bring back.  They were much relieved on finding what the actual condition of affairs was.  One end of the canoe was badly battered.</p>
                            <p>The government building leaks in several places and water poured down on to cases, but the contents were not reached.</p>
                            <p>The condition of the roof has been telegraphed to the supervising architect's office.</p>
                            <p>It was learned that save for the lagoon on the grounds and buildings stood the rain well, but the heavy iron framework of the giant see-saw settled several inches in the softened soil.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Weakness of Construction Results from the Ex-Superintendent's Changes in Plans Originally Drawn for the Work.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The rains of the last few days, culminating in the downpour of Friday afternoon and the early morning hours of Saturday, resulted in serious damage at the exposition grounds and made necessary a large amount of extra work, entailing considerable expense.  The greater part of the damage was done to the sheet piling about the lagoon, over 700 feet of the piling being pushed out of line by the weight of the water and mud and about 100 feet being broken off at the bottom and laid flat on the bottom of the lagoon.  A conservative estimate of the cost of the necessary repairs puts the figure at $3,500.</p>
                            <p>With the exception of the damage to the lagoon, the grounds escaped with little injury.  One corner of the Palace of Illusions in the Moorish village was blown away and the wings of one of the figures of Fame surmounting the Art building were blown off.  With these exceptions the damage done by wind and water was only such as may be repaired without difficulty.</p>
                            <p>The cause of the damage to the lagoon involved a page in the history of the exposition in which the name of Geraldine appears with great frequency.  It was the many crooked turns in the deal involving the contract for this same sheet piling that resulted in Geraldine being allowed to "resign," as superintendent of construction of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.</p>
                            <p>When it was decided to have a lagoon lined with sheet piling a competent draughtsman was employed to make plans for the piling.  On the plans and specifications made by this man bids were asked, but the figures of these bids were never made public except by statements of Geraldine when under examination on charges of fraud in connection with the letting of the contract for this work.  At that time Geraldine stated that James Connolly had bid $7,800 for doing the work.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">Geraldine Changes the Plans.</head>
                            <p>This and the other bids were considered too high and Geraldine undertook to change both plans and specifications so as to bring the cost down to a lower figure.  The man who made the original plans had been in the dock building business in Scotland and made the plans in such a way that the sheet piling would have resisted any pressure from either side.  Geraldine changed the construction entirely, cheapening it in every way.  For heavy timbers holding the sheet piling to the back piling, he substituted No. 8 galvanized iron wire, three strands being twisted by hand to form a cable.  Cottonwood piles were used for the back piling and for the posts for holding the sheet piling.  For this form of construction Creedon &amp; Mahoney were paid $5,936.50, and the exposition furnished and drove the piles at a cost, according to Geraldine, of $700, making the total cost $6,636.50, or about $1,2000 less than the bids under the original specifications.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine, just before he "resigned," ordered the earth back of the sheet piling to be excavated entirely around the lagoon.  Commencing at a point about six feet back of the piling and extending to a depth of about four feet along the piling, a triangular excavation was made.  It was explained that this was to prevent the frost from expanding the earth and pushing the piling out of line.  It finally dawned on him that when the springs thaws came the water would run down behind the piling and cause greater damage and the dirt which had been excavated was all shoveled back again, but was not tamped or even dressed off so as to shed the water and let it run into the lagoon over the coping.  As a result the spring rains soaked into the loose earth back of the piling and numerous places "buckled," the piling being forced out of line a foot or more.  About $900 was expended in repairing this damage, making the cost of the piling up to that time $7,536.50, not to mention the cost of excavating the earth back of the piling and shoveling it back again.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Runs the Cost Away Up.</head>
                            <p>The recent heavy rains have percolated through the paving to this same soft earth and the improvised cables snapped like thread with the weight of wet earth, the cottonwood piles broke off at the bottom of the lagoon and the whole thing tumbled into the water.  The estimated cost of repairing the damage&#8212;$3,500&#8212;added to the original cost and the former repairs, makes the total cost of this portion of the exposition about $11,000, against $7,800, which the work would have cost under the original specifications.</p>
                            <p>The most serious breaks occurred on the north side of the lagoon.  Near the west end of the Machinery and Electricity building for a distance of about 200 feet the piling has been torn from its moorings and is leaning out over the lagoon.  About thirty feet of the center of this section is lying on the bottom of the lagoon, the piles broken and the Geraldine cable vibrating helplessly in the air.  The staff-covered posts dangle over the water, being supported by the iron pipe forming the railing.  The wooden boxes forming the electric conduits are broken and the underground wires are torn and twisted.</p>
                            <p>The same condition exists in front of the Agriculture building, 300 feet of the piling being out of line and fifty feet flat on the bottom of the lagoon.  On the south side, near the west end of the Mines building, 150 feet of the piling is out of line, but none of it is broken entirely off.  Seventy-five feet near the west end of the Liberal Arts building is in the same condition and about 100 feet immediately west of the <choice><sic>Twenttieth</sic><corr>Twentieth</corr></choice> street bridge is in about the same state.  In addition to these places the triangular section of earth removed by Geraldine's orders is sunken and the piling has been forced out a very little, this condition prevailing almost entirely around the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The breaking of the electric light wires made it necessary to set poles for arc lights and run new circuits to furnish lights so that the work can be pushed night and day.  Superintendent Foster is giving the matter his constant attention and says he will not allow anything to interfere with pushing these repairs.  Three sifts of men will be employed and every effort will be made to complete the repairs as soon as possible.  The water has been let out of the lagoon in order to expedite the work, this fact alone entailing an addition expense of $400, as it will cost that much to fill it again.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Banks of the Lagoon Give Way and Quite a Little Damage Results.</head>
                            <p>The rain last evening playing havoc with the Dion Geraldine specially prepared tongued and grooved sheet piling around the lagoon.  That which many mechanics had confidently predicted occurred.  The piling gave way in many placed under the pressure of the water that ran off the pavements and carried the lamp posts and balustrades out of place.  Fully 600 feet of the work along the water's edge will have to be done again completely, and in many other places the cement work and paving will require repairing.</p>
                            <p>The damage is worst near the east end of the lagoon, where the piling stand higher out of the water and were not so well supported by the pressure of the water in the lagoon.  The north side suffered more than the south, the worst washouts being in front of the Mines and Mining building and the Machinery building.  In many places the water washed the banks out from under the pavement.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the damage to the lagoon the exposition was little affected by the storm.  The hail was so light that glass in the buildings nor none of the electric light globes were injured and nothing was displaced by the wind.  The roofs all stood heavy rainfall well and none of the interiors suffered, with the exception of the Government building, where a waste water pipe broke and flooded a part of the building, doing some damage to exhibits.</p>

                            <p>The sale of commutation tickets of admission to the exposition has increased very largely during the last few days and the exposition management has been "doing a land-office business" in disposing of the coupon book of fifty and 100 admissions to the show.  As usual, the people deferred the purchase of these books until the last moment and yesterday broke the record for sales.  It had been determined to discontinue the sale of commutation tickets at 6 o'clock last night, but requests were received from all sides asking that the books be kept on sale a few days longer.  The matter was laid before the executive committee at its meeting yesterday and it was decided to extend the time for the sale of these tickets until May 25, at 6 p. m.  It is announced in the most positive manner that these books will not be sold after that time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Everything on a Most Magnificent Scale, Leaving No Doubt Regarding Splendor that Will Be Spread Before the World.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The heavy rains of the last week have had no appreciable effect on the installation of the exhibits in the main buildings of the exposition.  On the contrary, the exhibits have multiplied at a rapid rate and the entire grounds present and appearance of activity which would be hard to equal.  Long trains of cars loaded with exhibits and bearing on their sides banners in a more or less bedraggled condition announcing to the world the fact that within are the exhibits from Georgia, Montana, Nevada, or some other state, have been pushed through the grounds, the switch engine puffing noisily back and forth along the bluff tract and into the main court.</p>
                            <p>As soon as a lot of cars are "set" behind the building in which the contents belong, a gang of workmen pounce upon them and in a miraculously short time the contents are transferred to the proper space in the building and the cars are whisked away to give place to another lot containing other exhibits.  As a result of this activity the interior of the main buildings look like great warehouses, the boxes, crates, barrels and other material being piled high up in the air, leaving scarcely space enough for the workmen to move about.</p>
                            <p>With the bustle of the workmen constructing the scores of booths and the noise of the hammers opening boxes of exhibits, the buildings are filled with a perfect babel of sound, but out of the seeming confusion elaborate booths are arising and the installation of the high class goods and specially selected exhibit material goes merrily on as though there was nothing to disturb the calm serenity of the exhibitors.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Rivalry Among Exhibitors.</head>
                            <p>Perhaps the keenest rivalry between exhibitors is discernible in the buildings where the several states come into direct competition.  This applies more particularly to the Mines, Agriculture and Horticulture buildings.  Nearly all of the states participating in the exposition will make displays in one or all of these buildings and the manner in which each is trying to excel the others in the matter of a display makes assurance doubly sure that the exhibits will be of the very highest order.</p>
                            <p>In the Mines building, for instance, the four prominent locations, those in the center of the building at the intersection of the main axes, are occupied by Utah, Montana, Colorado and Minnesota.  Each of these states occupies a space 25x70 feet and each is erecting a booth to cover the entire area.  The rivalry commenced with the designing of these booths, and each has tried to excel the others.  By a preconcerted plan, there is a similarity in the general design of these booths, but in carrying out the details of decoration individual taste has had full swing, and it would require very keen discrimination to decide between the manifold beauty of all of them.  All of these states are on hand with their exhibits, but Utah and Montana have the advantage in having an earlier start.  Colorado and Minnesota, however, are pushing their booths, and all will be ready before the opening day.  The exhibits have not yet been unpacked, each state jealously guarding its material from the eyes of the others, but the manner in which dark and mysterious hints are given regarding specimens of ore of fabulous value and collections of various sorts, leaves no room for doubt regarding the splendor which will presently <unclear reason="torn"/> spread before the world <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Directly in the center of the building will be a gem case containing a collection of specimens of all the precious gems found in the United States.  This will include many rare and valuable gems, including turquoise, topaz, pearls, diamonds and many other beautiful precious stones.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Great Mining Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>At either side of this case will be the exhibit of Arizona.  This will not occupy a very large space, but Dr. Day, the mining commissioner of the exposition, says the Arizona collection will be one of the finest mineral exhibits ever made.  This collection was made with a view of sending it to Paris in 1900, but it was decided to sent it to Omaha first.</p>
                            <p>Nevada, New Mexico, Georgia and several commercial exhibits are also on hand in the Mines building and other states are coming in every day.</p>
                            <p>In the Agriculture building state pride is still further in evidence.  The Nebraska contingent was first on the ground and preparations for the booth have reached an advanced stage.  The booth is a very elaborate affair and the decorations being placed on it, while composed entirely of grains, are handsome and graceful.  Iowa has a position directly opposite Nebraska and the booth being erected is designed to harmonize with that which will shelter the Nebraska exhibit.  Minnesota is erecting a booth which will be on the classic order and of a rather elaborate design.  Montana will have a very handsome booth, but the details are shielded from prying eyes by a curtain extending entirely around the space.  The Douglas county exhibit is being made ready for the installation of the exhibits, but the decoration of the booth has not been pushed and the exhibits have not been brought to the grounds.  The Rock Island and Cotton Belt railways are each making very elaborate preparations to install exhibits of the products of the fertile lands along their lines.</p>
                            <p>In the Horticulture building Los Angeles county, California, and the Utah commission have things all their own way, they being the only occupants of the building.  The Los Angeles county exhibit will be a most gorgeous affair.  The exhibit occupies the entire east end of the east wing of the building and a booth has been constructed of staff to resemble an ancient monastery.  Standing on the wall, in full view from every part of the building, is a life size elephant which is to be covered with English walnuts.  The exhibits will be on the scale of magnificence which characterizes the exhibits of this enterprising section of California.</p>
                            <p>Scores of commercial exhibitors have taken possession of the Manufactures, Liberal Arts and Machinery and Electricity buildings and extensive preparations are being made to prepare a series of exhibits which will attract and hold the attention of visitors to the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Action was taken by the executive committee yesterday to increase the size of the parade which is to form a feature of the opening exercises of the exposition, and it was decided to invite all uniformed bodies of secret societies to take part.  The original intention of the management was to have the parade a grand military demonstration and preparations were made for <choice><sic>brining</sic><corr>bringing</corr></choice> to Omaha large bodies of troops from various parts of the country, but the war spoiled all these plans and carried off all the available military except the cadets at the University of Nebraska and the Omaha High school.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the nature of things it will be impossible for the exposition management to communicate with all of the uniformed secret societies in this vicinity, and it was decided to extend an invitation through the newspapers.  All such societies are asked to report to Major T. S. Clarkson at exposition headquarters in the Paxton block as early on Monday (tomorrow) as possible, giving the name of the society, the name of the commanding officer and the number of men.</p>
                            <p>In connection with this parade it was reported that fifty or sixty carriages would be required for the guests who have been invited to take part in the opening ceremonies.  There has been a great demand on the facilities of the local liverymen and all carriages, hacks, etc., have been engaged by private parties, leaving the exposition without any recourse in that direction.  It was decided to ask private citizens having carriages to loan them to the exposition for the occasion, and all persons willing to loan their carriages for this purpose are asked to notify the Transportation department at exposition headquarters of that <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>With the opening of the exposition all employes will appear in uniform.  It was decided to adopt this plan in order that the employes may be distinguished at a glance and visitors enables to pick out those to whom to apply for information.  The uniform adopted is a suit of dark  blue throughout, the coat being a sack with brass buttons.</p>
                            <p>The branch of the service will be indicated by the trimmings of the uniform, the colors of the several departments being as follows: Ways and Means, light blue trimmings; Publicity and Promotion, a badge of red, white and blue; Buildings and Grounds, white trimmings; Exhibits, green trimmings; Concessions, red trimmings; Transportation, royal purple.  All janitors will wear white suits.  The employes in the Bureau of Admissions will wear caps, the Exposition guard will wear white helmets, and the employes in the Concessions department will wear soft, gray slouch hats.</p>
                            <p>Manager Lindsey was authorized to ask for bids for supplying these uniforms.</p>
                            <p>Before adjourning, the matter of electing a general manager was taken up, but it being then 4:30 p. m. it was decided to make the election of a general manager the first order of business for the regular meeting of the committee tomorrow noon.</p>

                            <p>The first exhibit to be installed in the big Transportation and Agricultural Implement building was a red firm wagon made by the pupils in the Haskell Indian school.  This is a part of the exhibit of the Indian bureau of the Interior department, but there was no room for the big wagon in the Government building, and it was given space in the building on the north tract.  Colonel D. H.

He contends that he has an exclusive contract with the exposition people, entered into long prior to the time of the contract with the defendant.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the National League of Republican Clubs has notified President Wattles that it will be in Omaha May 27 to arrange for the meeting of the league in this city July 13, 14 and 15.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Thomas Ward White, the veteran evangelist of the Presbytery of Eastern Texas, has been appointed vice president of the Fourteenth senatorial district of Texas for the exposition, vice Hon. R. A. Greer, who has resigned.</p>
                            <p>The LaCrosse (Wis.) Times says that LaCrosse will have at least one exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Egid Hackney, an altar building who lives in LaCrosse, will exhibit a magnificent specimen of wood carving representing the different stations of the cross.</p>
                            <p>In answer to an inquiry from the department at Washington asking how many Transmississippi Exposition stamps the Chicago postoffice would require, says the Chicago Chronicle, Postmaster Gordon notified the postal authorities that his office would require about 12,000,000 of different denominations of the first issue.</p>
                            <p>According to the statement of the Denver Times the Colorado mining exhibit at the exposition will eclipse anything that has ever been attempted.  More than $50,000 worth of gold ore alone will be on exhibition and $25,000 worth of silver ore.  The finest samples of ore belonging to the state collection will be brought to Omaha and private collections will be drawn on.</p>
                            <p>The Ohio club of this city has announced its determination of raising $750 for the erection of an Ohio building on the bluff tract and a communication has been sent to the Ohio Exposition commission asking that an equal sum be appropriated for the building.  If this is done it is expected that a very creditable Ohio building can be erected.</p>
                            <p>The reports being received by Secretary Carroll of the Missouri Exposition commission, from the chairmen of the various bureaus of the commission, indicate that every bureau is trying with might and main to excel every other bureau and all are beginning to make demands for more space in which to install their materials.  Secretary Carroll is greatly encouraged and makes the formal announcement that the Missouri exhibit will excel everything else on the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Nebraska's Representatives at Washington Continue to Work for It.</head>
                            <head type="sub">POSSIBILITY THAT THE SCHEME WILL GO</head>
                            <head type="sub">Senators Thurston and Allen Are Doing All They Can to Have the Conferees Agree to Appropriate the Required Sum.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 21.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Indian congress bull is in imminent danger of defeat notwithstanding that the senate conferees on the Indian bill have told both Senators Thurston and Allen that so far as they were concerned they would support the amendment.  Direct opposition, it is understood, comes from Chairman Sherman of the house committee on Indian affairs, who, on the score of economy, believes that it would be an extravagant waste of money at the present time to vote $45,000 for an ethnological congress of Indians at Omaha.  Representatives Curtis of Kansas and Little of Arkansas, members of the conference committee, have personal items in the bill which they hope to secure by opposing the senate amendment for the Indian congress.</p>
                            <p>When this state of affairs was made known to Allen and Thurston they at once resolved to do everything in their power to bring about a change of hearts on the part of Sherman and Curtis.  Senator Platt of New York will, it is thought, take a hand in bringing order out of chaos and Senator Thurston will move everything to accomplish the adoption of the amendment.</p>
                            <p>A rather unexpected turn to the present condition of the Indian congress scheme was had today by a telegram from E. Rosewater, manager of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, who wired Secretary Bliss asking if the department would pay back any moneys paid out in preliminary arrangements looking to the holding of the congress providing the sum of money was appropriated to go ahead with the congress pending legislation.  Mr. Rosewater also wired Senator Thurston to urge upon the secretary the importance of immediate action along the lines outlined above.  In consequence Senator Thurston had an extended conference with Secretary Bliss, Assistant Secretary Thomas Ryan and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Jones in relation to this most important feature of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston succeeded in receiving permission for Captain W. A. Mercer to go ahead on the details of the congress, but the department refused to be responsible for any expenses that might be incurred, but Secretary Bliss suggested that Senator Thurston could obviate any difficulty by having inserted in the Indian bill a clause covering preliminary expenditures.  Later Acting Secretary Ryan sent the following telegram to Mr. Rosewater:</p>
                            <p>"Referring to your telegram of yesterday to the secretary of the interior I would state that the department is without funds or specific authority to do anything in the matter.  Under the general powers of the department Captain Mercer will be directed to carry out the plans you refer to when the Indian office is authoritatively advised funds sufficient to meet all expenditures that will necessarily be incurred in fully carrying out such plans have been donated for that purpose and deposited in a national bank to the credit of W. A. Jones, commissioner of Indian affairs.  Should the department be authorized at any time by congress to reimburse moneys so donated and properly expended for the purpose referred to such reimbursement will be made.  It must be distinctly understood, however, that the government does not and will not incur any liability whatever in the matter."</p>
                            <p>It is well known that the Interior department is great interested in the possibilities of the Indian congress, and it has been thought if Congressman Sherman is shown to what extent the plans have gone he may be induced to forego his opposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Composite Picture Produced by the Exposition Managers.</head>
                            <p>A certain very interesting touch of originality has surrounded most of the plans of the Transmississippi Exposition in Omaha, but nothing more uniquely clever than the complete picture which will be reproduced on the official medal.  Forty-four of the handsomest women of the western states were chosen by competent judges and their pictures forwarded to the official photographer.  These women illustrate the strongest type of western womanhood and the result in composite form has been thoroughly satisfactory.  The picture shows a face, at once strong and lovable, a fine profile, with a strikingly intellectual cast.  On one side of the medal will appear an Indian in the act of spearing a buffalo, the ensemble suggestive of the strides made by the people of west in civilization and broad culture within the last fifty years.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Everybody who entered the exposition grounds yesterday turned his eyes toward the lagoon, for it had become generally known through the papers that the damage wrought to the retaining sheet piling by the rain of Thursday had been <choice><sic>geratly</sic><corr>greatly</corr></choice> augmented by the storm late Friday evening.</p>
                            <p>The sheet piling is giving way in half a dozen places around the edge of the lagoon, the damaged parts aggregating about 600 feet.  In two places, one just in front and to the east of the Machinery and Electricity on the north side, and one just in front of the Agriculture building on the same side, the piling and planking have completely collapsed for a distance in each case of fifty feet, and gone into the water.  In other places, notably just west of the island on the south side and in front of the Mines and Mining building on the south side, the piling has been pushed toward the water for several feet and is hanging over the water.  There is perhaps 200 feet of the piling in this condition, and for the rest, the cement gutters and capping along the edge has cracked and the timber has made a start inward.</p>
                            <p>The damage west of the island on the south side was done by Thursday's rain, and men were at work Friday and Saturday repairing it and preventing a further yielding.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WORK OF REPAIR.</head>
                            <p>Superintendent Foster yesterday lost no time in getting men to work on the lagoon and efforts will be unremitting until the piling is fully restored.  Mr. Foster says that he estimates the number of feet affected at 600.  He states that a good deal of the timbering can perhaps be drawn back, but that much new work will have to take the place of the old.  Temporary arc lights are being strung along the edges of the lagoon and the labor will be carried forward night and day.  It will cost, in Mr. Foster's estimation, about $3,000, and can be completed in four or five days, so that the lagoon, which is being emptied to facilitate the work, may be filled up and be in better condition than ever by the opening day.</p>
                            <p>The superintendent was asked his opinion of the cause of the breaks.  He said that it undoubtedly was that the wire cables binding the round piling at the edge of the lagoon to the anchor piles twenty-four feet back were not strong enough.  He calls attention to the fact that in no case have the anchor piles yielded a particle.  He says the cables should have been four times stronger, and that he has already put in some capable of holding a weight of 40,000 pounds.</p>
                            <p>Besides the weakness of the cables, there has been much filing done about the lagoon, and this trenched and trenched again with some careless tamping, so that the soil has been just of the kind to soak up the water and put an enormous strain on the piling.  Another point is that the recently laid brick pavement about the lagoon is not well drained.  The water stood on it to a depth of several inches in a great many places, giving time for soaking through, to be added to the volume of earth and water below.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SLIGHT DAMAGE ELSEWHERE.</head>
                            <p>In other parts of the grounds the tremendous fall of rain also made itself felt.  Trenches have settled here and there in many places.  The most serious case is the trench running directly under the Administration Arch.  It has sunk a foot or more, threatening the foundation of piles, and the matter is therefore being looked after with great diligence and dispatch.</p>
                            <p>There was a report that on the old fair grounds tract the heavy iron framework of the giant see-saw had settled several inches and was out of plumb, but this is not true.  The iron is on heavy piling, which has not bulged a particle in any direction, and work on the see-saw is progressing as usual.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Moore of the Government building states that it is not true that the down pipes were too small, but that the trouble is that the sewer on Twenty-fourth street, into which the roof water from the Government building runs, is too small, and that it filled up and caused the water in the roof pipes to back up and overflow.  Two of the pipes, which come down inside the building, were flat when the storm was over, the theory being that when the water left them it did so so suddenly as to cause a vacuum and that the flattening was done by the pressure of the air.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Moore's theory is not entertained by the contractors on some of the other large buildings, which also leaked.  They say that the down pipes were too small to carry the water off.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday, save for damp walls in various places and wet spots on the ceilings, one would not have known from inside appearances that there had been a rain.  Exhibitors who are installing say that some drops got on goods, but that no damage to speak of was done.</p>
                            <p>Frank Wiggins, installing the California fruit exhibit, said that since the roof above him leaked in twenty places he was disposed to make a kick, but when he found that the situation was about the same in the other buildings he decided not to say a word.</p>
                            <p>Director Griffith of the fine arts section did not leave the building all Friday night and was on constant watch when the midnight storm came up to see that no pictures were touched.  None were, and Mr. Griffith says that there was no leaking worth mentioning.  He is on the whole satisfied that the building is just what it was intended it should be, a little more secure than any of the others on account of the character of the exhibits it is to house mud behind it.</p>
                            <p>Most people had left the grounds when the evening storm came on.  Dick Berlin, the superintendent of the Agriculture building, was about the only one left there.  He could hear the wire cable snapping all along the lagoon, and was apprehensive that all the timbering would go in with a big wash of</p>

                            <p>The unexpected sometimes happens, but the expected happens much more often.  The collapse of a section of the lagoon sheet piling at the exposition, which seriously interferes with the completion of the work surrounding the lagoon, has by no means been an unexpected disaster.  On the contrary, it is the inevitable consequence of the high-handed course pursued by Dion Geraldine in tampering with plans and specifications for the benefit of contractors.</p>
                            <p>It will be remembered that when charges of misconduct were preferred against the former superintendent of grounds and buildings they were pooh-poohed by Geraldine's backers in the executive board and condoned by the committee that investigated the charges for the directors.  While the inexcusable blunder can be rectified only by a large outlay of the stockholders' money, it is interesting as a matter of exposition history to read the explanation Geraldine submitted to the investigating committee in the light of the lagoon disaster.  It is as follows:</p>
                            <p>After a careful revision of the specifications I decided to modify the specifications as shown in the contract with Creedon &amp; Mahoney, the principal charges being to sink a ditch one foot and drive six inches instead of driving two feet six inches.  I also decided to set the anchor piles from twenty to thirty feet back from the mainstay piles instead of ten to sixteen feet, as shown in the drawings, and I also changed the connection of these piles from stringers to galvanized wire cables as shown. * * * The change of backstays from timbers to wire cables eliminated the stringers, amounting to about 16,000 feet, and substituted the cables.  I believe the cost in using cables is more than to use timbers and bolts, remembering that the distance, doubled in the revised plans, made double the amount of ditching and refilling.  The wire had to be twisted into cables and spliced back at both ends, and then twisted with a turning rod to take up the slack.  The change in sheet piling from a depth of two and a half feet to one and a half feet shows an apparent saving of nearly 15,000 feet, but the fact is the lumber was ordered on the original measurements, and as a result the one foot eliminated was partly sawed to waste and partly driven to a greater depth. * * * It is stated that Creedon &amp; Mahoney were relieved of an expense of $200 on iron work.  This statement is also untrue.  The only iron work shown in the original plans was the bolts for the backstays, which were eliminated by the substitution of cables, as before explained, and the lag screws for fastening the walling to the mainstay piles as shown in the original drawings, when it was designed to put the waling on the front side of the sheet piling.  In the Creedon &amp; Mahoney contract you will observe that we reserved the right to place this waling back of the sheet piling, and the contractor agreed to make no additional charge.  This charge was made and involved an additional expense to the contractor of nearly $200, instead of relieving him of an expense of $200.</p>
                            <p>In the face of this self-convicting admission, Geraldine's inexcusable conduct was glossed over, the only reference to it in the committee's report being the following:</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Geraldine states that for reasons which seem to be satisfactory to the Department of Grounds and Buildings he changed the plans and specifications of the work in some minor particulars.</p>
                            <p>These "minor particulars," so manifestly in the interest of the contractors, have proved most costly to the exposition.  To the substitution of wire for stringers, bolted to the piles, and the extension of the loosely-filled trenches behind the piling, is to be ascribed the breakdown of several hundred feet of the lagoon embankment.  The bland and brazen assertion of Geraldine that the changes in plans and specifications arbitrarily made by him after the contract was let were in the interest of the exposition and to the detriment of the contractor afforded within themselves sufficient grounds for his summary dismissal instead of an exoneration intended to reflect upon the member of the executive committee who had the courage to denounce the fraud.</p>
                            <p>As a matter of fact the lagoon break is the most insignificant part of the loss the exposition has suffered from Geraldine and the contractors' combine which he represented.  The estimated cost of repairing the lagoon embankment is $3,000.  Instead of $3,000 it is safe to say that a competent and honest general superintendent or director general if employed a year ago could and would have saved the exposition not less than $75,000.  In this, however, as in all such enterprises, experience is the best schoolmaster, although the tuition fees come <unclear reason="covered"/></p>

                            <p>Thousands of people, a large proportion of them strangers in the city, thronged the exposition all day yesterday and walked around the main court, through the buildings, over the south viaduct from end to end of the bluff tract, over the north viaduct and through the West Midway to the buildings on the north tract and they pronounce it good.  There was plenty to see and nothing escaped the eyes of the sightseers.</p>
                            <p>It had been intended to close the gates to all parts of the grounds and charge admission to any part, but the necessary arrangements were not completed in time and the bluff tract and the north tract remained open to all comers without cost.  The price of admission to the main court, however, was increased to 25 cents and thousands of people paid the price without a murmur, realizing that the exposition is nearing the opening day and there is abundance to be seen which is well worth the small price of admission.  Carriages and vehicles of all description thronged the bluff and north tracts and pedestrians perambulated about from place to place.</p>
                            <p>In the main buildings the work of preparation went merrily on and many new exhibitors were added to the already long list of those who are making ready for the opening day.  There were several hundred people in each building at all times and they wandered around among the boxes and cases and the partially prepared booths gazing with admiring eyes upon the showing already made.  The mineral exhibits being arranged in cases in the Mines building for the New Mexico and Nevada displays were the center of attraction in that building and everyone who passed through the building stopped to inquire about the beautiful specimens being handled like so much precious china.  Each separate piece was taken from the packing case carefully wrapped in several thicknesses of paper and labeled.  The work of arranging proceeded slowly amid the many inquiries and requests for explanations.</p>
                            <p>The elaborate preparations being made in the Agriculture building attracted a great deal of attention.  The booths of the Nebraska commission, the Rock Island and Cotton Belt railways are in advanced stages and it would be difficult to tell which is the more attractive.  A crowd of admirers surrounded each of these booths all day long and many flattering comments were made upon the elaborate decoration of each of these booths.</p>
                            <p>The material for the exhibits in the Machinery and Electricity building are arriving rapidly and they are being placed in position with a speed which leaves little doubt as to their being finished for the opening.</p>
                            <p>In the Art building a large force of workmen were engaged, under the direction of Art Director Griffiths, in placing the many beautiful pictures in position.  This work requires a great deal of patience and care, but very rapid progress is being made.  The east section of the building is entirely completed and the director and his assistants have full possession, but the west wing will not be completed until Tuesday or Wednesday of this week and the greatest exertion will be required to complete the arrangements of the pictures in time, but Director Griffiths is confident that the work will be completed in ample time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plans Drawn at Portland Show a Remarkably Handsome Structure.</head>
                            <p>The plans for the Oregon building have been accepted and the construction of the building on the bluff tract will be commenced as soon as possible and pushed to an early completion.  The plans show a building which is octagonal in plan occupying about thirty feet square, surrounded by a broad porch about eighteen feet wide.  It is in the form of a tower fifty feet in height.  The eight corners of the tower are to be built of tapering fir shafts finished in the natural wood.  It is designed to have the interior of the headquarters arranged to display the products of the state as well as the beautiful timber that comes from Oregon in great lengths and without a blemish.  The exterior walls above the porch gallery are to be cemented with material which is mined in Oregon.</p>
                            <p>The floor of the porch is but a few inches from the ground and will be a very comfortable place to rest.  Provision is made for a summer garden on the porch gallery which is to be adorned with palms, bamboo trees and plants giving a tropical effect to the whole.  A reception room occupying two-thirds of the lower floor is provided with French doors opening to the porch floor.  A stair case adjoining the main entrance leads to a gallery six feet wide built around the inner walls.  Exhibits of the state, including views from all sections are to be arranged on the walls together with some herbarium cases.  Besides the toilet rooms on the ground floor there will be tables where will be displayed all the leading Oregon newspapers and literature pertaining to the state, its resources, advantages, Portland as a commercial center, and the people of <sic>of</sic> the state.  The record of the Oregon display from the time of the inception of the enterprise when Governor Lord appointed the state commissioners up to that time of the establishment of the exhibit at the fair is being compiled by D. C. Freeman, of Portland, and press representative for the commission, and it will make an interesting feature of the <choice><sic>readlng</sic><corr>reading</corr></choice> room.  This will show the comments and articles and other matter pertaining to the mission of the Oregon commission from every newspaper published in the state.</p>
                            <p>The Oregon building was designed by Mr. Edgar Lazarus, an well known architect of Portland.  It is though that finished and <choice><sic>pannelled</sic><corr>panelled</corr></choice> in the natural Oregon wood, it will make a very unique and attractive headquarters.  The lumber for the entire building was generously given for this purpose by Inman, Poulsen &amp; Co. of Portland.</p>
                            <p>A number of specially taken views of the operations of some of the greatest placer mines of southern Oregon will be displayed at Oregon headquarters.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Prof. H. P. Attwater of San Antonio Arrives in the City.</head>
                            <p>Prof. H. P. Attwater of San Antonio, Tex., who has charge of the Texas state exhibit, arrived on Saturday night and was at the exposition grounds yesterday looking after Texas interests.  The professor says the Texas exhibit was shipped last week and should be here at any time now, though he feared that perhaps the heavy rains and washouts in the Indian Territory might delay the arrival a day or two.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the exhibit which would be made by Texas, the professor said he would much rather prefer to wait till it was in position before attempting to describe it.  However, he said their object is to show to the visitors of the exposition the wonderful resources of their great state.</p>
                            <p>"We have not come to present an elaborate complication of wonderful decorated designs for people to admire," said he, "for we have no time for that.  The samples of our products and undeveloped resources will attract more attention and interest more visitors than all the splendid displays of professional up-to-date decorations that I find are being indulged in by other exhibitors.</p>
                            <p>"Our Texas display will be a great attraction in the Agriculture building, and being located in the gallery will be the means of bringing many people upstairs each day who would be likely to miss the great displays in the gallery if Texas were not there to draw them.</p>
                            <p>"We expect to have our exhibit in good shape by opening day, ready for visitors, but of course there will be additions made to the exhibit continually so that visitors will see new things every time they visit the Texas space.</p>
                            <p>"I shall return to Texas as soon as possible in June, and bring up a carload of grapes, melons and other fruits which at this time are hardly matured far enough for exhibition.</p>
                            <p>"We asked your exposition managers to allow us ten days more time so that we could have all the exhibits must be in place by opening day, and so here we are on time.</p>
                            <p>"By the way, I see you haven't commenced planting corn here yet.  Now if you will be around when my car gets here I will give you a mess of roasting ears for The Bee, and also a curiosity in the vegetable line, the first ripe United States watermelon for 1898, raised by John Willacy, Portland, San Patricio county, Texas.  This melon has 'Dewey' scratched on the side.  It was intended for him, but as it can't reach him, South Texas presents it to the president of the exposition."</p>
                            <p>Learning that Prof. Attwater had charge of the great natural history display for Texas, at the New Orleans exposition, and also considerable experience at other fairs and enterprises of this kind. he was asked what he thought of the progress now made toward being ready for opening day.</p>
                            <p>"You are all right" said he.  "In fact I can tell you, you are much farther advanced than I expected to find.  The people will find a grand show ready on June 1, so tell them to come.  Of course many unimportant, finishing touches will have to be made later on, as the case of our own Texas exhibit, but the prospects for a fine start are better than at any previous affair of the kind with which I have been connected.</p>
                            <p>"I wish to say further, that your officials are the best set of men I ever met at an exposition.  I met a number of them this morning, and while I ought not to mention names perhaps, I want to say that Mr. Hardt of the Exhibit department, and R. S. Berlin, superintendent of the Agriculture building are the right men in the right place.  The latter welcomes one as if they had been an old friend, instead of a complete stranger, and I was at home in five minutes.</p>
                            <p>"With such men as you have at the head of this enterprise it cannot fail to be a grand success and I want to say that Texas appreciates your kindness, and that we propose to be strictly in it and one of the attractions at your great show."</p>

                            <p>The exhibit to be made by Arizona in the Mines building is the source of a great deal of gratification to Dr. Day, the mining commissioner for the exposition.  The exhibit will be made by mine owners and will occupy the most prominent position in the building, a point directly in the center of the main floor.  The most conspicuous portion of the exhibit will be a column of magnificent copper ores, a glittering, <choice><sic>irridescent</sic><corr>iridescent</corr></choice> column of prismatic hues, which will form one of the most conspicuous objects among a collection of precious minerals representing the most prodigious wealth.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the copper column there will be magnificent specimens of silicified wood, great trunks of trees forming integral parts of a huge forest which occupied the now arid districts of Arizona in the untold ages.  These rare specimens of the chemical action have been polished on one face, showing the brilliancy of the finish of which the material is susceptible, while the remainder is left in the natural state, an object lesson forming great food for thought.</p>

The turret is of the Hichborn type, containing two twelve-inch guns.  All of the interior mechanism is shown and the exact workings of this complicated piece of naval construction are susceptible of careful study.  The model is habitually displayed with one side of the turret removed and with one gun in position for loading while the other is ready to be fired.  A flat conning tower surmounts the turret affording a means for seeing all about.  The man in charge of the guns stands on a platform between them with his head in the conning tower and the levers which control the guns at his side.  The revolution of the turret is effected by a serious of levers manipulated by a man at one side of the tower and the loading of the guns is performed by mechanical means.</p>

                            <p>"The formal opening of the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be one of the most important events in the history of the great west," said President G. W. Wattles, "and it is desired to have the ceremonies attending the opening on a scale commensurate with the magnitude of the enterprise.  As the details of the matter have been left in my hands I desire to have the parade preceding the formal exercises at the ground as imposing as possible and on a scale in keeping with the great extent of territory interested in the exposition.  In order to accomplish this, I wish to invite all uniformed secret societies and all bands in Nebraska or in any of the surrounding states to come to Omaha on the opening day and take part in the parade.</p>
                            <p>"As it is impractical to send invitations to each of these societies and bands, I wish The Bee to make an official announcement as coming from me, inviting all uniformed secret societies and all bands anywhere in the United States to come to Omaha and take part in the exposition parade.  All societies and bands taking part in the parade will be given free admission to the exposition grounds on the opening day and the affair will be made a gala occasion.  The only restriction is that the secret societies must be uniformed, and by that I mean that they must have a complete uniform consisting of a suit of clothes and not merely a badge or collar.</p>
                            <p>"I shall be pleased to hear from any society or band which will come to Omaha on this occasion and will be glad to welcome any which come.  Our parade will start from Sixteenth and Douglas streets at 10 a. m., and that point will be the rendezvous."</p>
                            <p>In connection with the opening day parade Manager Babcock of the Transportation department is receiving numerous offers of private carriages for use in the parade for the many distinguished guests who will be present.  The people who have thus offered the use of their vehicles intend conveying their families to the grounds at 9:30 a. m., allowing the carriage to report at the Millard hotel at 9:45 for use in the parade.  As soon as the parade reaches the grounds, which will be about 11 o'clock, carriages will be released, as the guests will be taken care of on the grounds during the day.</p>
                            <p>As there will be a large number of guests of the exposition present on the opening day, a number of carriages will be required and Manager Babcock says he can use several more than have been offered.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Day, the mining commissioner, is in ecstasies over the receipt of a mineral exhibit which he enthusiastically declares is something never undertaken to be shown at any exposition and a thing which very few people on this earth have ever seen.  He even went so far as to declare that this exhibit was an improvement upon the work of nature.  After the exuberance of the doctor subsided slightly he found time to say that the exhibit is a <choice><sic>hal fsection</sic><corr>half section</corr></choice> of a carborundum furnace, with the product shown just as it appears in the furnace.  Carborundum is a manufactured product which is next in hardness to the diamond.  It is never found in nature, but is made in an electrical furnace where it is subjected to a tremendous heat.  After the material is made the <choice><sic>funace</sic><corr>furnace</corr></choice> is destroyed in order to get the valuable product out, and the exhibit which Dr. Day has secured shows the manufactured product at this stage.  The feat of making a section of the furnace and product was a most difficult one, and the task of transporting it was much more difficult.  It was accomplished, however, and the exhibit will be given the place of honor in the Mines building.  Aside from the great rarity of this product of electrical science, it is very beautiful and Dr. Day predicts that it will be one of the main attractions of the Mines building.</p>
                            <p>Another exhibition of great value which has been received is a collection of turquoise from New Mexico, valued at about $2,000.  This collection will be placed in the large octagonal gem case, which has been installed at the exact center of the main floor of the Mines building.  Dr. Day says this variety of turquoise is the only found anywhere in the world which does not change color and it has the finest color of any which has ever been discovered.</p>

                            <p>The sheet piling about the lagoon is nearly all in place again, the large force of workmen which has been engaged constantly since Saturday having nearly completed the "straightening up" process.  To prevent a recurrence of the disaster it has been determined to replace the makeshift cables used as ties to hold the sheet piles to the anchor piles with stout cables, and each alternate pile is being securely anchored to the back piles in this manner.  As the piles are ten feet apart all around the lagoon, this process results in placing a heavy cable at intervals of twenty feet all around the lagoon.  Much of this work has already been done and the brick paving has been replaced.  The repairing of the cement coping the resetting of the staff posts which were destroyed by the breaking of the piling will be completed very soon and the whole work will be finished before the end of the week.</p>

                            <head type="sub">All Sorts of Sights and Sounds Are Now to Be Heard There.</head>
                            <p>The Midway is a'borning.  Down in the section where the exposition powers have decreed that the sons and daughters of alien lands shall show their wondrous ways and marvelous activities for the benefit of American gold sounds and sights quaint and suggestive meet the ear and eye.  As one enters the garish gate of their abode the zum-zum of the base accompanied to a dance which has imparted strange but lasting ideas to American minds is wafted across the courtyard from the Egyptian quarters.  No, you cannot enter.  It is all private so far, monsieur, but perhaps&#8212;  You turn to the turbaned gentleman on your left.  Ah, this is the wonderful illusion performance.  Next is the Greek acrobatic aggregation.  A little farther on and passing booths where the guardians know not your strange utterance is the domicile of the animal end of the show.  Six long, patient looking, venerable ships of the desert are there, and out of their wise eyes comes the knowing gleam anticipating divers and sundry loads of wondering yokels and blushing buds and awkward grooms and&#8212;well, they have done duty before.  And all the other denizens seem to have something of the same wisdom in their attitude and demeanor.</p>
                            <p>You can drift across almost anything on the Midway, even at this stage.  A dark-eyed daughter of the Pharaohs hastens by in the half-deshabille, her sense of propriety&#8212;well, never correct, and is followed by a skirted somebody&#8212;and then, unless you are a showman, you are kept wondering where there men and women of many nations belong.  Everybody is busy, as busy as a bird dog, and everybody is idle when results are looked for.  The amount of work done is inverse to the amount of chatter and talk, and talk is the principal occupation.</p>
                            <p>In the center of the enclosure is the theater.  Here rests the hope, not only of the denizens of the little dwellings, but of many eager anticipators of strange sights.  The architecture is outre, full of color, bizarre and, as comports with its object, spacious in capacity.  Yes, they know what to put on this stage.  They are here from many expositions and they are always learning new varieties and features and they will delight the hosts who will come to gaze upon them with many, many startling ideas, not born or known in the land of liberty and the Caucasian.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Methods of the Workmen Cause Much Amusement to Others.</head>
                            <p>"Look at the healthy Chinee!  Eight uv 'em liftin' wan two-by-six joist!  Ha, ha, ha."</p>
                            <p>And a stalwart son of the Emerald Isle supplemented his jocosity by certain undertone phrases not on the map.  A number of workmen stood by and joined in the laugh.  It was at the Mee Lee Wah Village company.  "The Chinesers," as the red-shirted workman put it, were giving another example of their methods and likewise an occasion for the outbreak.  Perched on top of the Chinese village main building were two workmen, Americanized Chinese.  One of them asked for a joist, using the Chinese equivalent for "send up a two by six."  There are twenty-seven sons of the Celestial kingdom at work on this immediate department.  "Bling-a-ling-hoop-tla"&#8212;and eight or ten of them started.  Expectation was aroused and when they appeared supporting a six-inch joist the crowd laughed.  They felt it and all but two, after some pow-wow, dropped off.  Then the foreman appeared and though an interpreter said something, they all dropped the load.  He motioned to a boy who carries water to the laborers.  The boy came, picked up the joist, and, mounting the ladder, carried it to the top of the roof.</p>
                            <p>The contrast between the methods of the workmen of the two civilizations is really startling.  For instance, there are five men stationed on a single ladder which leads from the ground to the pinnacle.  They are covering the roof with bamboo.  One Chinese holds a 2x4 strip of bamboo, another holds the nail to be driven, and a third sends home the fatal juncture with a large amount of guttural jargon.</p>
                            <p>They are artistic also.  The Chinese concessionaires acceded to the taste of country, etc., and agreed to put on a certain imitation brick design as adornment to the exterior of the building.  The Chinese workmen started all right.  Then they began to get the right to left, backwards, upside, down&#8212;altogether mixed Chinese idea and placed pseudo brick imitations in more strange positions than a country quilt-maker ever conceived.  But Irish stubbornness intervened and the Chinese symbolism were relegated.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant Dorothy Mauer of the local Salvation Army post received an inspiration Sunday to the effect that the statues on the Arch of States at the exposition grounds contained objectionable features.  The young woman took counsel with Lieutenant McCormick, a sister salvationist, and together they made an excursion to the grounds Sunday night.  The gates were locked, however, and there was no way apparent of scaling the walls.  Yesterday the women made a tour through the neighborhood and located a ladder at a new building near the grounds.  Last night about 11 o'clock they left the barracks, and walking to the Twentieth street entrance reared the ladder against the fence.  Lieutenant McCormick stood guard outside while her more venturesome sister climbed the ladder, and carefully avoiding the barbed wire on top of the fence, descended on the other side.</p>

                            <p>Nevada claims the distinction of being the first state to have its exhibit ready for the inspection of visitors, and Colonel H. B. Maxson, the energetic representative of the mountain state, is not hiding that fact under a bushel, but is flaunting it in the faces of his less successful competitors in a <choice><sic>wty</sic><corr>way</corr></choice> that is calculated to spur them to redoubled efforts.</p>
                            <p>The mineral exhibit of Nevada is all arranged and the precious specimens of ores of every kind found in the territory, numerous varieties of stone, including the precious onyx and many other rare kinds, all are in place in the handsome cases, and they form a most attractive and interesting exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Maxson's heart is broken, however, over the sad fate that has befallen his agricultural exhibit.  The material was all piled in a heap in boxes and barrels on the space in the Agricultural building assigned to Nevada, and when Colonel Maxson and his assistants finished the arrangement of the minerals they made a descent upon the agricultural collection with a view of getting this ready in short order and breaking the record in this department also.  Upon inspection of the various materials constituting this exhibit it was found that the heavy rains of last week had found that the heavy rains of last week had found a hole in the roof of the building directly over the Nevada exhibit and had ruined all the flour and all the salt, there being about 1,000 pounds of both.  Colonel Maxson was "stumped."  The salt had been collected in the natural state as an illustration of one of the many undeveloped resources of the territory and it could not be replaced in time for the opening.  The flour was the product of Nevada mills and freight formed a very important item in its transportation.  It was decided that the only thing to be done would be to arrange the exhibit without these commodities, but Colonel Maxson said it was serious loss.</p>

                            <p>President F. M. Sterrett of the Missouri commission, S. A. Stuckey of Carthage, chairman of the committee on mines and minerals of the commission, and F. P. Graves, superintendent of the Doe Run mine in southern Missouri, arrived in the city last night to complete arrangements for the space for the Missouri exhibit.</p>
                            <p>President Sterrett said that all of the space reserved for Missouri will be occupied with the exception of that reserved for the state building.  Owing to the great difficulty in raising money for the exhibit it was decided to abandon the idea of erecting a building and devote the money that would be expended for that purpose to that exhibit.</p>
                            <p>"We will make a good showing in all lines," said President Sterrett, "but will make our greatest effort in the mineral and horticultural exhibits.  In these lines we will excel anything that may be done by any other state.  Our mineral exhibit will be greatly augmented by private exhibitors who will assist us by showing their private collections, which are priceless in value.  Mr. Graces, for instance, who is with us on this trip, has a collection which he has been years in amassing and which could not be equalled without similar effort.  There will be many others the same way and in that way and what our commission has done our mineral showing will be exceptionally fine."</p>
                            <p>President Sterrett and party will leave the city tonight, after making all arrangements for space, and will attend a meeting of the commission which will be held in St. Louis Thursday of this week, to close up all business preparatory to the opening of the exposition.  The president and many of the members of the commission will attend the opening and Mr. Sterrett says that large numbers of Missouri people are making preparations to come to the exposition.</p>

The plaintiffs contend that they have the exclusive right to do this thing, while the defendants aver that they are the only ones who have the right.</p>
                            <p>Icilio Ninci, head man in the Streets of Cairo, is pretty certain that he has the drop on Gaston Akoun, who occupies the same position with reference to the Streets of All Nations.  He says that by the terms of the temporary order that prevents the exhibition of camels and donkeys, Akoun has brought trouble upon himself.  He says and says it in an affidavit, that last Sunday, for the purpose of advertising, Akoun gave a camel exhibit and allowed persons to ride the beasts.  He also says that on Monday night Akoun paraded his camels and donkeys and featured them at the initiation ceremonies held at the den of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben.  Testimony will be taken on this issue when the case comes <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <head type="sub">AT THE TRANSPORTATION BUILDING.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Big Structure on the North Tract Rapidly Filling Up.</head>
                            <p>The Transportation and Agricultural Implement building is rapidly assuming display shape.  It is one of the most notable buildings at the exposition, and, further, will contain exhibits of a character and variety which will interest people to as great an extent as any other department at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The building is admirably planned and built.  It is 432x300 and on an average twenty feet in height in the clear.  Four tracks run into the north end of the building, which greatly facilitates the handling of exhibits.  The top is so constructed as to admit an enormous volume of light, alternating sections having skylight roofs.  To avoid possible heat, the floor construction is such that a perfect gale of wind can be readily formed by the opening of five double doors on each of the four sides.</p>
                            <p>Almost the entire available space has been already secured.  On the tracks mentioned will be shown the consummation of the train-builder's art.  Representatives of the chief railway and locomotive builders of America have en route or already in storage the finest products of their wonderful art.  The remainder of the building is given up to the arts of the husbandmen and the manufacturer who makes his tools.  Plows, harrows, wagons, buggies&#8212;all that which will appeal to the great "bone and sinew of society," will be exhibited.  Two sections are given up to bicycles, and here the cranks will find full indulgence for the numberless fancies and whims of the man who rolls.</p>
                            <p>"This is the best building for the purpose ever constructed," said Superintendent D. H. Elliott.  "I have been at the Chicago fair, where this sort of thing was inaugurated and things were experimental and flimsy.  I went to Nashville and Atlanta and I assure you none of them compare with this.  We are going to have a wonderful exhibition.  Our space is about all taken and by the highest class of exhibitors I have ever seen.  This building will be the center of attraction to the man who works, the artisan, the farmer, the builder, in fine, the worker.  Aside from our exhibits, the Department of Forestry will command very general attention and admiration.  We have the finest products of the country and will appeal to men in every department of commercial life."</p>
                            <p>Some 300 workmen are getting the American hustle on themselves all day long.  Things are shaping up rapidly, exhibits are pouring in and the Transportation building bids fair to be one of the most attractive of the many departments at the exposition.</p>

                            <p>A carload of negroes from Georgia and Alabama have arrived and taken up their headquarters in the Old Plantation on the West Midway.Headed by a band of eighteen pieces and playing inspiring American quicksteps the party marched through the principal streets of the city.  There were uncles and mammies, bucks and wenches and pickaninnies by the dozen.  Following the party was a couple of wagons containing the baggage.</p>
                            <p>The cavalcade stopped in front of The Bee building while the band ground out a tune and then the route to the exposition grounds was taken and the parade ended at the quarters being prepared on the north tract.  Log cabins have been erected and the entire population of the village will be employed from now till the exposition opens in cultivating cotton and tobacco fields and making the interior of the village a bower of beauty with flowers and vines.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commander Stedman Urges the Department to Increase Its Display.</head>
                            <p>The force of officials at the Government building has received fresh acquisitions in the persons of Lieutenant Commander E. M. Stedman, the representative of the Navy department, and W. DeC. Ravenel, representative of the Fish commission.</p>
                            <p>The first official act of Commander Stedman was to open communication with the Navy department in the effort to secure more material for the exhibit of that department.  He was greatly impressed with the general appearance and magnitude of the exposition and with the general arrangement of affairs in connection with the government exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ravenel expressed his satisfaction with the entire situation and promised that the fish exhibit should surpass anything that has heretofore been attempted by his department.  "Some of the fresh water fish have already arrived," said Mr. Ravenel, "and others will arrive within a few days.  The ocean fish will come along the latter part of this week and we are going to show the people of this section a lot of fish such as very few of them ever saw.  I believe the fish exhibit will be entirely satisfactory to the people who visit the Government building and we will aim to make it as interesting and instructive as possible."</p>
                            <p>The live fish referred to by Mr. Ravenel as having already arrived are a lot of trout which were brought from Colorado yesterday by a special messenger from the government hatchery at Leadville.  The shipment included about 150 little beauties of the trout family, there being four varieties as follows:  Lock laven, the ordinary brook trout, the black spotted and the rainbow trout.  These occupy four tanks in the <choice><sic>acquarium</sic><corr>aquarium</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>The other live fish, both fresh and salt water varieties, will arrive during the current week and will be installed in their new homes as fast as they arrive.</p>

                            <p>The decoration of the interior of the Nebraska building is proceeding rapidly and the building is beginning to present a cheerful and homelike appearance, which will undoubtedly make it a popular place.  The tinting of the interior was completed some time ago, and the walls are being beautified by the hanging of large numbers of handsome oil paintings from the brushes of Nebraska artists.  These are being hung under the direction Miss Mellona Butterfield, and add very much to the appearance of the building.  The governor's suite on the second floor, has been carpeted, the main room with Wilton carpet and the smaller room with handsome matting.  The other rooms are being arranged in various ways suitable to the purpose for which they are intended and the furniture will be installed in a few days.</p>

Wilber of South Sioux City was appointed a guard, Miss Lela Wheeler of Lincoln was appointed postmistress during July and Miss Lulu Burroughs, also of Lincoln, was elected postmistress for the balance of the term, Jessie Gandy of Broken Bow was elected assistant in the floral department and Cyrus Lyndell of Lincoln was made assistant custodian.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 24.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;It is learned that Chairman Sherman of the house committee on Indian affairs and also by virtue of his position representative of the house conferees on the Indian appropriation bill has finally withdrawn his opposition to the amendment in the Indian bill appropriating $45,000 for an Indian congress at Omaha.  Mr. Sherman's opposition to the measure was based upon what he supposed would amount to a practical demoralization of the Indians in association with the hurry and bustle of the exposition.  He further stated that he understood that Captain Mercer, in charge of the Omaha and Winnebago reservation, would be relieved and ordered to join his regiment.  This was emphatically denied by Secretary Bliss, who stated that Captain Mercer would be kept at his post and would be in charge of the Indian congress, should such be ordered by congress.</p>
                            <p>As to the other objection, Senator Thurston showed Congressman Sherman that Indians who have gone out with Colonel Cody, with but very few exceptions, have come back better Indians than when they left their reservations, and as to the question of demoralising, it was purely one of theory not borne out by practical demonstrations.  Senator Platt of New York today had an interview with Representative Sherman and it is now stated that opposition to the measure has been overcome.</p>

The map is 4x8 feet and on a scale of five miles to the inch.  It shows all the counties in the state, rivers, county seats and principal towns.  The valley of the Platte is beautifully outlined, as well as the watershed and rivers.</p>

                            <p>Resolved, That the exposition grounds and buildings to be kept open on Sundays from 1 p. m. to 10 p. m. and conducted in the same manner as on week days, except that the sale of liquors be not permitted; that concerts be given and that religious services be held in the Auditorium on Sunday afternoons.</p>
                            <p>By adopting the above resolution by a vote of 24 to 12 the board of directors of the exposition yesterday afternoon solved the mooted question of keeping the exposition open on Sunday in accordance with the demands of the laboring class who are employed during the week or closing it up on Sunday in compliance with the demands of the ultra-religious element.  The debate on the question was long and serious and amendments and substitutes were offered in profusion, the resolution finally adopted being generally regarded as a compromise of the two extremes.</p>
                            <p>The meeting lasted nearly three hours, the only other business transacted being the adoption of a report of the executive committee defining the duties of the newly appointed general manager of the exposition and abolishing the position of general superintendent of the exposition, changing the title of Mr. Foster to that of superintendent of the Buildings and Grounds department and increasing his salary from $200 per month to $300.  This resolution was reported by a majority of the executive committee, Manager Rosewater submitting a resolution contrary to it, providing for the consolidation of the office of general superintendent and general manager and placing Mr. Foster in full charge as general manager.  The last resolution was defeated.</p>
                            <p>The meeting of the board was held in the Administrative arch on the exposition grounds, being the first formal move on the part of the board to take possession of the buildings.  The members entered many vigorous protests against walking up the long flights of steps necessary to reach the main floor of the high building during such warm weather.  When they reached the place of meeting, however, they were delighted with the view of the main court and north tract.  From the loggias on all sides the directors enjoyed the view while waiting for a quorum to appear, and several members of the board admitted that the view thus taken was their first sight of the grounds since active building operations were commenced.</p>

                            <p>The rooms on the main floor of the arch consists of a central room about thirty-five feet long and about twenty feet wide.  The floor of this is bare and tables and chairs afford a means of transacting business.  Opening from this central room on the north corner is the room of the president, at the northeast, and that of the general manager at the northwest.  Both of these rooms are neatly carpeted and furnished with suitable office furniture.</p>
                            <p>A quorum was secured after a short delay and it was announced that the secretary would not be present.  Dudley Smith was elected secretary pro tem, and President Wattles immediately laid before the meeting the resolution adopted by the executive committee relating to keeping the exposition open on Sundays.</p>
                            <p>This resolution provided that the grounds should be kept open on Sundays from 9 a. m. to 10 p. m., all the exhibit buildings to be closed except the Fine Art, Horticulture and Auditorium, it being provided that no malt or vinous liquors or any other articles, except refreshments or temperance drinks, might be sold anywhere on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The discussion was precipitated instanter and everybody wanted to talk.  Mr. Webster asked why the Government building should be closed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater replied that the Government building had always been closed at all expositions, but that this is a matter over which the exposition had no control and the resolution was not designed to apply to the Government building.</p>
                            <p>A number of directors wanted to know why the Midway should be closed if the other parts of the grounds were to be kept open.  Dr. Lee seemed to strike a popular chord when he remarked that he could not see any logic or reason in keeping the Midway closed on Sundays, if it was allowed to remain operate the balance of the week.  "If there is to be anything on the Midway that people should not see on Sunday," said the doctor emphatically, "they should not see it on week days."</p>
                            <p>Some of the directors wanted to know why all the buildings should not be kept open on Sundays if the grounds were to be open.  It was explained by members of the executive committee that many of the exhibitors would not display their wares on Sundays and to open the buildings without all exhibits being in full view would be to detract from the attractiveness of the whole.</p>
                            <p>Director Youngs objected to any of the buildings being closed on Sundays, as the working class would only be able to visit the grounds on that day.  He moved to amend by providing that all buildings should be kept open the same as on week days.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock advocated yielding somewhat to the sentiment in favor of Sunday closing by closing the grounds during the morning hours and opening at 1 p. m., thus removing the objection that the exposition would keep people from church.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton asked for information as to other expositions and the Sunday closing question.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Carpenter said he had investigated that matter and he produced numerous communications from officials of other expositions.  He said the Philadelphia centennial was closed on Sunday, as were the Atlanta and Nashville expositions.  The World's fair was open on Sunday only a part of the time, the story of the prolonged contest in court with injunctions and counter injunctions being reviewed by Mr. Carpenter.  The California Midwinter fair was open on Sundays half of the day toward the end of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton made a stentorian appeal in behalf of the "10,000 societies of young people of the transmississippi states who have signed protests against opening the exposition on the Sabbath."  He insisted that the board ought to conciliate the thousands of signers of these protests.  If the grounds were to be kept open on Sunday no admission should be charged, but the poor people who were not able to come during the week should be given the opportunity of seeking the exposition without money and without price, if the board desired to be consistent.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kilpatrick called attention to the fact that the people who were making such strenuous objections to opening the exposition gates on Sunday because the employes and exhibitors would be compelled to work on that day had made no objection while the large force of workmen had been busily employed every Sunday for over a year in making preparations for the exposition.  He said this work of preparation was neither a work of necessity nor of charity, but now that it was proposed to offer a means of recreation and education to the people who would seek amusement elsewhere if denied the privilege of visiting the exposition, these people sent up a great wail of protest.  He advocated the utmost deliberation in deciding this important question and expressed the hope that nothing would be done which could offend the religious feelings of any person.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Question of Sunday Attendance.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Webster said that doubtless many of the 200,000 signers of the numerous protests which had been received would never attend the exposition whether it be closed on Sundays or not, and of the 3,000,000 which it is estimated will attend the exposition these will form a very small proportion.  On the contrary, a large proportion of the population which wants to visit the exposition cannot come any day but Sunday, and these people ask that the exposition be kept open on that day.  For this reason, he said, he favored keeping the gates open.  He suggested that the concerts might be modified and that some noted divine might be invited to make an address in the Auditorium on Sunday afternoons.  He suggested that the Midway might be closed on Sundays out of deference to the sentiment that this feature<unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said that it was impractical to close the Midway unless a fence was built at each end Saturday night and removed Monday morning, and he doubted if this would keep the people out.  He said that if the laws were enforced and disorderly conduct prevented there would be nothing objectionable.  He favored opening the gates because people will come to Omaha in great number on Sunday to see the exposition.  The sanctity of the Sabbath is sure to be violated and the best thing to do was to endeavor to minimize the evil as much as possible.  Thousands of people will be on the streets of Omaha and it will be better to provide amusement for them under proper restrictions than to allow them to hunt questionable amusement in other quarters.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Carpenter advocated the maintenance of the sacredness of the Sabbath by closing the gates, claiming that the gain in dollars and cents would be small compared with the moral effect of closing.</p>

                            <p>Other members of the board discussed the matter more or less informally and drafted the resolution which appears at the beginning of this article.  This was adopted by the following vote:</p>
                            <p>Ayes:  Brandeis, Bruce, Dickinson, Evans, Hibbard, Holdrege, Hussie, Jardine, Kilpatrick, Kimball, Kirkendall, Korty, Kountze, Lee, Price, Reed, Rosewater, D. Smith, Thompson, Wattles, Webster, Wells, Wilcox, Youngs&#8212;24.</p>
                            <p>Nays:  Carpenter, Hitchcock, Lindsey, Metz, Noyes, Payne, Rector, Saunders, Weller, Wharton, Wilhelm, Yost&#8212;12.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall then introduced a resolution providing that the salary of Mr. Foster should be raised to $300 to take effect thirty days after the time when he was first employed by the exposition.  This was adopted without discussion.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey then read a resolution which he said had been agreed on by a majority of the executive committee, providing that the general manager should be placed in full charge of the exposition under the direction of the executive committee; that he should make such suggestion to the committee as he deemed proper, and should be empowered to discharge any employe for cause below the grade of superintendent.  The resolution also provided for the abolition of the office of general superintendent and the retention of Mr. Foster at a salary of $300 with the title of superintendent of the Buildings and Grounds department.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Opposes a Sinecure.</head>
                            <p>As soon as this was read Mr. Rosewater read a resolution providing that the offices of general manager and general superintendent be consolidated and that Mr. Foster be placed in full charge of the work of the various departments.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater moved the adoption of his resolution and charged that the adoption of the resolution read by Mr. Lindsey simply meant the creation of a sinecure with salary of $300 per month for Mr. Clarkson, while Mr. Foster performed all the duties of the office at a similar salary.  He denounced the whole proceeding as a farce and said the resolution introduced by him as a minority of the committee simply aimed to give to Mr. Foster the powers it was conceded he was well able to exercise.  The other resolution simply created an ornament.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall exclaimed that he could not put in any more time at the grounds than he had been doing and he wanted a reliable man for his superintendent upon whom he could depend for the carrying out of instructions.  He said Messrs. Foster and Clarkson had consulted regarding the matter and both were satisfied.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater objected to allowing Foster and Clarkson to divide the kingdom between them.  He said Clarkson would necessarily be away from the grounds most of the time and it would be the same old story with Foster in full charge of everything without any power to remedy defects and without power over the employes of the other three departments on the grounds.  He had no authority in the past and as a result of this method of doing business the International building is sixteen inches lower than the plans and specifications provide for.  The exposition had been cheated in this building and it is hard to say who is responsible.</p>
                            <p>A vote was taken on the adoption of Mr. Rosewater's resolution, resulting in its defeat by a vote of 7 ayes and 25 nays.</p>
                            <p>The Lindsey resolution was then adopted and the meeting adjourned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Judge Scott Listens to the Expressmen's Exposition Story.</head>
                            <p>The case wherein John Berkins and W. A. Gordon seek to restrain the Omaha Merchants' Express and Transfer company and the Transmississippi and International Exposition association from interfering with them in hauling for exposition exhibitors was called in Judge Scott's court yesterday afternoon and the hearing was partially completed, to be concluded this morning.</p>
                            <p>It is the contention of the plaintiffs that the exposition people have granted the official transfer company a monopoly and that the same should be dissolved.  Attorney Montgomery for the exposition made a showing that the official transfer company was hauling at much lower prices than other companies that submitted bids at the time of making the contract.  He also made a showing that all the draymen who complied with the rules of the exposition were at liberty to haul from the city depots to the grounds.  He said, however, that the transfer company had the exclusive right to haul from cars switched to points inside the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Exhibit in Shape for Inspection by Visitors Now.</head>
                            <p>Nevada claims the distinction of being the first state to have its exhibit ready for the inspection of visitors, and Colonel H. B. Maxson, the energetic representative of the mountain state, is not hiding that fact under a bushel, but is flaunting it in the faces of his less successful competitors in a <choice><sic>wty</sic><corr>way</corr></choice> that is calculated to spur them to redoubled efforts.</p>
                            <p>The mineral exhibit of Nevada is all arranged and the precious specimens of ores of every kind found in the territory, numerous varieties of stone, including the precious onyx and many other rare kinds, all are in place in the handsome cases, and they form a most attractive and interesting exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Maxson's heart is broken, however, over the sad fate that has befallen his agricultural exhibit.  The material was all piled in heap in boxes and barrels on the space in the Agricultural building assigned to Nevada, and when Colonel Maxson and his assistants finished the arrangement of the minerals they made a descent upon the agricultural collection with a view of getting this ready in short order and breaking the record in this department also.  Upon inspection of the various materials constituting this exhibit it was found that the heavy rains of last week had found a hole in the roof of the building directly over the Nevada exhibit and had ruined all the flour and all the salt, there being about 1,000 pounds of both.  Colonel Maxson was "stumped."  The salt had been collected in the natural state in a remote portion of the state as an illustration of one of the many undeveloped resources of the territory and it could not be replaced in time for the opening.  The flour was the product of Nevada mills and freight formed a very important item in its transportation.  It was decided that the only thing to be done would be to arrange the exhibit without these commodities, but Colonel Maxson said it was a serious loss.</p>

                            <p>Among the arrivals at the exposition grounds yesterday were four sprigs of royalty.  It is as yet undetermined which gender they belong to, for the reason that their royalty is due to the fact that they are children of a captive King of Beasts and have not yet been in this vale of tears long enough for even their proud mamma to get very well acquainted with them.  One of the handsome lionesses belonging to the Hagenback animal show gave birth to four cubs while on the train which brought the show from its winter quarters in California.  They cannot claim to be the first children born on the exposition grounds, but they can lay claim to being native Nebraskans, and that is something these days.  The keepers think the mother and her very interesting family can be removed from their present uncomfortable quarters, which were improvised from a packing case on the train, and installed in a comfortable cage today.  The mother lion seems to be very proud of her babies.</p>
                            <p>Another feature of the animal show that is unique in these parts and gave much amusement to the visitors on the West Midway was the work of one of the performing elephants.  She was harnessed to a big moving van and hauled the other animals in boxes and crates from the cars to the show building.

                            <p>The Exposition guard is making rapid progress in military tactics under the efficient instructions of the drill masters forming the corps of officers.  Daily drills are held, in which the men are put through severe training, to acquaint them with the foot movements.  These drills are held in the open space on the north tract, set aside for the infantry drill ground, being back of the Wild West show.  The exercises have been held during the forenoon of each day, but owing to the heat at that time it has been decided to hold the drill at 5 p. m., hereafter.</p>
                            <p>The vacancy in the office of captain has been filled by the promotion of Marcus Covell, who was appointed as first lieutenant.  The position of first lieutenant, left vacant by this promotion, was filled by the appointment of Joel Stebbins of Omaha, a young man who has had military instruction at the Omaha High school, University of Nebraska and in the Thurston Rifles.</p>

Log cabins have been erected and the entire population of the village will be employed from now till the exposition opens in cultivating cotton and tobacco fields and making the interior of the village a bower of beauty with flowers and vines.</p>

                            <p>Lieutenant Dorothy Maurer, the Salvation Army officer who recently created a mild sensation by deforming a nude statue at the exposition grounds, will defend her actions next Thursday morning in police court.

                            <p>Miss Maurer took exception to the charge placed against her of malicious mischief and made an effort to have it changed.  She claims that her act was not prompted by maliciousness, but by a desire to remove from sight what she considered a menace to morality.</p>
                            <p>The lieutenant will not leave Omaha to hush the matter, although steps have been taken to that end through Mayor Moores.  She said emphatically that she would stay here and see her case through, be the punishment what it may.  She has been in communication with her superior, Mrs. Colonel Higgins, who has charge of the army in this section, and it is believed she is acting on the colonel's order in this regard.  It is the belief of the city officials and exposition officials that the case against the lieutenant will be allowed to drop.</p>

                            <p>The improvement in the conditions surrounding the Indian congress appropriation shown by the reports from Washington, was welcome news to the exposition officials.  Considerable doubt has enveloped this matter during the last ten days, but the latest reports indicate that the passage of the appropriation is again assured.  It is not likely that the appropriation will be made soon enough to be <choice><sic>avaiable</sic><corr>available</corr></choice> in time for assembling the Indians at Omaha for the opening of the exposition, but this difficulty has already been surmounted.  Arrangements have been made by which the necessary money will be advanced by the exposition management, to be repaid by the government out of the appropriation.  This will enable those having the matter in charge to proceed with the arrangements without any delay.  Captain Mercer, U. S. A., who will have charge of the encampment, has been in close communication with the exposition authorities during the pendency of this matter and preparations for the encampment have been progressing as though the passage of the appropriation was assured.  A number of Indians from the tribes in this section will be brought to Omaha, probably in time for the opening, and the other details of the congress will be carried out as soon as may be.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Judge Scott Listens to the Expressmen's Exposition Story.</head>
                            <p>The case wherein John Berkins and W. A. Gordon seek to restrain the Omaha Merchants' Express and Transfer company and the Transmississippi and International Exposition association from interfering with them in hauling for exposition exhibitors was called in Judge Scott's court yesterday afternoon and the hearing was partially completed, to be concluded this morning.</p>
                            <p>It is the contention of the plaintiffs that the exposition people have granted the official transfer company a monopoly and that the same should be dissolved.  Attorney Montgomery for the exposition made a showing that the official transfer company was hauling at much lower prices than other companies that submitted bids at the time of making the contract.  He also made a showing that all the draymen who complied with the rules of the exposition were at liberty to haul from the city depots to the grounds.  He said, however, that the transfer company had the exclusive right to haul from cars switched to points inside the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The entire morning was spent in the introduction of contracts and arguing the legal phases of the suit.  The attorney for the exposition contended that all draymen had a right to haul exhibits from the depots to the grounds, but that in transferring exhibits from cars switched into the grounds the exposition officers had a legal right to control the unloading and delivery of all articles.  Attorneys for the plaintiffs urged that the draying franchise was in the nature of a monopoly and that the Merchants' Express company had no right to an exclusive franchise for doing the business.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exposition Management and Citizens at War Over a Crossing of the Boulevard.</head>
                            <p>There is a warm fight in progress between the residents of the tract to the northwest of Kountze park and the exposition people.  When the exposition officials were arranging for the use of the Twentieth street boulevard to connect the North Tract with the main park, it is asserted by the residents interested, promises were made that if consent was given to the closing of the boulevard, some sort of arrangement would be made for a passage way at the intersection of Manderson street.  All winter the intersection has been kept open, and has been used.  Last night it was closed.  As soon as it was known that the street had been cut off, a delegation, armed with axes, broke down the fence.  The exposition officials had the fence replaced.  Again it was broken down, and again replaced.  The people who are concerned, say it will be broken down as often as built, until some arrangement is made to carry out the original agreement.</p>
                            <p>City authorities have asked that some plan be adopted to allow free passage across the boulevard on Manderson street.  It is the way taken by many people to go to and from their work at East Omaha and the shops.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Lieutenant McCormack of Salvationists Tells Why She Hacked Exposition Statuary.</head>
                            <p>Ensign McCormack, who chopped off an arm and hacked a leg of one of the nude figures on a building at the exposition grounds Monday night and was <choice><sic>arrrested</sic><corr>arrested</corr></choice>, appeared in police court yesterday morning to answer the charge of malicious destruction of property.  No complaint had been filed and she was told to return again Thursday morning for arraignment.</p>
                            <p>The ensign was accompanied by Lieutenant Dorothy Maurer, who, it is now claimed, was merely her accomplice in the mutilation of the statuary.  Both women appeared at ease insofar as the infliction of a penalty is concerned.</p>
                            <p>Ensign McCormack said:  "We simply performed our duty as Christians and have no fear that the Lord will desert us under such circumstances.  We were led by the Lord and believe that he will continue to lead us.  No, we will not engage an attorney.  We have put our trust in the Lord and know that he will guide us safely through.  He is a better attorney than any earthly being."</p>
                            <p>Continuing Ensign McCormack said that she came to Omaha eighteen months ago from Boston, since which time she had been presiding as the matron of the rescue branch of the Salvation army work at the home, 2015 Pinkney street.  The statuary, to which the ensign took exceptions owing to its nudity, is located immediately north of the home and in plain view of the inmates of the institution.</p>
                            <p>"We had been contemplating," she added, "such a move for several days, and the convenience of a ladder on one side of the exposition fence and a freight car on the other side, with a desire to incite public feeling in opposition to such immoral features of the exposition, is what prompted us to do what we did.  We feel that we have done our duty now and will leave the public to do the rest.  No, we would not repeat the act, as we feel that what we have done is sufficient unto the day thereof."</p>
                            <p>Night Watchman Sage, who arrested the mutilators, has sworn to a complaint charging them with the malicious destruction of an image valued at $75, the property of the exposition association.  Sage says the woman performed a dangerous feat in scaling the side of the building and endangered her life in walking a twelve-foot plank without any support, fully twenty-five feet from the ground.  He was not positive which woman did the chopping, except that it was the smallest and best looking one of the two.</p>
                            <p>While both women claimed to have had a hand in the affair it appears from his version that Lt. Maurer used the ax while the other stood guard.</p>

Day and night shifts of men are bending every energy and their efforts are bearing fruit.  The repair work on the lagoon before the opening day will be entirely completed.  It will be much stronger than formerly and thoroughly capable of resisting all heavy rains that are likely to occur.  The leakages in the roofs of the various buildings have been remedied and no more trouble is expected from this source.  This is a matter of great concern to the exhibitors, who feared another heavy rain might greatly damage decorations and exhibits.  The work of beautifying the landscape on the main court goes merrily on.  The courts between the Liberal Arts and Mines and Mining buildings on the south, and the Agricultural and Manufacturing on the north of the lagoon are being turned into veritable "posy" gardens, spots that will be the delight of all.  The temporary house on the south side of the lagoon, used as a fire engine station, has been removed from the ground, and the work of grading for the bridge across the lagoon can now be completed, and this will be followed by the laying of the brick pavement.  Twentieth street, leading from the Administration Arch to the Transportation building, is being graded and rolled, preparatory to being covered with gravel.</p>
                            <p>The closing of the week will mark the completion of the Press, the Hospital and the Service buildings.  The occupancy of the same will occur Monday and Tuesday and by the opening day all will be comfortably ensconced therein.  The fire department has taken possession of its new building.  The present apparatus consists of two hose wagons with roller bearings and 900 feet of hose for each wagon; one hook and ladder truck, the latest improved make, with seven ladders, ranging in length from twelve to sixty feet, and several small extension ladders for inside use.  The two chemical engines from New York have not arrived, although they have been on the road a number of days.  These engines will be stationed for use on the main court, while the present apparatus will be removed to a new engine house to be erected on the bluff track.  The present fire company numbers nine men, as follows, but which is to be augmented by seven others: H. L. Pearman, captain; James P. Downs, lieutenant; Z. L. Smith and Charles A. Hopper, drivers; George McKray, William Gorman and William Guider, truckmen; William Burmester and John D. McGreal, pipemen.</p>

                            <p>The Transportation building, which is one of the largest of its kind, is fast attaining exhibition style.  The south division, used as the agricultural implement department, is being crowded with all the latest and most improved machinery and implements known to this age, from a light carriage and heavy wagon to the largest threshing machines and engines.  The Pullman Palace Car company has a splendid display of its cars, there being a long line of sleeping, dining and observation cars.  As soon as gotten in condition these cars will be opened to visitors, showing how easily and comfortably one can now travel.  There is also on exhibition one of the first sleeping cars made, which affords quite a contrast to the modern one <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>"The Old Plantation" has been taken possession of by the negroes, lately arrived from the south.  They are hurrying to get their cabins in readiness for occupancy, the work being done by the younger members, while "old granny" and "old man" superintend, the little pickanninies frolicking "on the green" nearby, giving one something of an idea of their daily life in the south.  The wild and wooly west is to be pictured in the Wild West show.  The small boy with the inquisitive eye has kept a close watch for several days on the quarters of the Hagenback's animal show company.  Over 100 animals, two-thirds of the entire number, have already arrived and been caged.  The balance of the show is expected to arrive either tomorrow or Sunday.</p>

There will be sixteen of these stiles, distributed as follows:  Two at Twentieth and Pinckney at the main entrance, three at Twenty-fourth and Pinckney, three at the railway entrance on Boyd street, three at Sherman avenue under the south viaduct on the west side and two under this viaduct on the east side of Sherman avenue, two at Sixteenth and Spencer streets and one at Twentieth and Manderson streets.  These exit turnstiles are to accommodate the people who wish to leave the grounds during the ordinary hours of the day or evening.

                            <head type="sub">Makes Arrangements for Permanent Quarters Down Town.</head>
                            <p>The British-Canadian club held a regular weekly meeting at exposition headquarters last night.  The chief feature of the business portion was the decision reached on securing permanent club headquarters, room 431 Ramge block, having been decided on.  It will be attractively and comfortably furnished.  There will be registration books, and information bureau and a rendezvous for British-Canadian visitors.  The club also decided to secure desk room at once in the Nebraska State building on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>At the close of business Rev. Campbell Fair, dean of Trinity cathedral, gave a pleasing address in reference to the work and duty of the club.  The dean urged that the club do all in its power to assist in building up the exposition. which means so much for America, Nebraska and Omaha.  He thought it the bounden duty of every citizen to stand by Omaha this summer and be loyal to the city.  He has been going abroad every year, having already forty-nine trips over the ocean, but intends remaining at home this summer to show his loyalty to Omaha and the exposition.  He urged that the club be courteous and hospitable to all strangers, letting everything be done in a kind and generous manner, and at the close all would feel better for having done so.</p>

                            <p>The Horticulture building is taking on an animated appearance, and many exhibitors are making the building resound with the noise of hammer and saw as the busy workmen exert every energy to complete the construction of booths and the installation of exhibits before the opening day.  The horticulture and floriculture exhibits of Nebraska and Douglas county are being installed and the horticultural exhibits of Illinois, Washington, Missouri, Oregon, Kansas and Montana and Los Angeles county, California, are in various stages of preparation, the last named exhibit having reached a stage where only the finishing touches are necessary to complete a most attractive and artistic exhibit.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska commission has removed its office effects to the state building on the bluff tract, where its headquarters will henceforth be.  Nice, easy cane-seated rockers, sitting chairs and settees will afford resting places for the wearied wayfarer.</p>

                            <p>The Minnesota state building has been commenced.  It occupies a splendid site on the bluff track, a little southeast of the Nebraska building.  The permit issued for its erection calls for a $10,000 structure, which will not lack any of the essentials to make it compare favorably with other state buildings.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Russell Spaulding of New York is stopping at the Omaha club, having come to Omaha to remain a couple of weeks and take in the exposition.

                            <head type="sub">SOCIETIES AND BANDS WILL TAKE PART</head>
                            <head type="sub">Invitation to Participate is Generally Accepted, Although Many Nebraska Societies Think They Ought to Be Paid.</head>
                            <p>The opening day parade of the exposition seems destined to be a gigantic affair.  Since the issuance of the general invitation by President Wattles to all uniformed secret societies and bands to take part in the parade and be admitted free to the exposition grounds on that occasion notices have been pouring into the office of the president from all quarters from both societies and bands, tendering their services in honor of the occasion and the indications are that the parade will be miles in length and contain representatives of every town and village within a radius of several miles of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>By far the great part of the societies and the bands tender their services without a hint of any attendant expense so far as the exposition is concerned, but a few see what they think to be an opportunity for killing two birds with one stone and they offer to confer the honor of their presence provided the exposition management will defray the expense of railway transportation or certain other incidentals.  As the manner in which proffers of services without any expense indicates that there will be as many of both societies and bands as the management can conveniently handle, it is not likely that the exposition will "defray" to any great extent.  It has been a subject of some comment that all of these applications for assistance in reaching the exposition come from Nebraska societies or bands, organizations in other states appearing to appreciate the magnitude of the enterprise and the value of the concessions tendered in the invitation to participate.</p>
                            <p>Preparations are in progress to have a tribe of Indians take part in the parade and President Wattles is in communication with Captain W. A. Mercer with a view of having this brought about.  Captain Mercer has taken a great interest in everything connected with the Indian feature of the exposition.  President Wattles has asked Captain Mercer if a band of mounted Indians cannot be brought to Omaha to participate in the opening day parade and if this feature materializes it will form a most attractive addition to the pageant.</p>

                            <p>A party of editors of newspapers published in towns along the lines of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha railway, arrived in the city as the guests of the railway company for the purpose of inspecting the exposition.  The party came in on the regular morning trains of the road, there being about seventy people, including the women.</p>
                            <p>The visitors were taken in charge about 10 o'clock by Major Clarkson and escorted to the exposition grounds.  They visited all portions of the grounds, passing through the buildings on the various tracts and noting the progress of the work of preparation.  The magnitude of the exposition was most forcibly impressed on the members of the party after the circuit of the grounds had been completed and the great beauty of the main buildings, and <choice><sic>especialy</sic><corr>especially</corr></choice> the entire main court, was the subject of numerous and enthusiastic discussions.</p>
                            <p>The party returned down town at noon and partook of luncheon at once of the hotels.  Short talks were made by Major Clarkson and General Passenger Agent Buchanan of the Elkhorn, as well as be several of the visitors.  The majority of the visiting editors left the city on the regular evening train, while others will remain until the morning train.</p>

Manager Babcock of the Transportation department of the exposition has been upon the witness stand for a couple of days, explaining the contracts for hauling exhibits, and the necessity of the exposition having this work under control to a certain extent.  With a contract with some carrier, Mr. Babcock has testified that exhibits can be traced from the cars to the buildings in much the same manner as they could if they passed through a bonded warehouse.</p>

                            <p>The action of the board of directors in ordering the exposition kept open from 1 to 10 p. m. on Sundays will have no effect on the Government building, and that structure will remain closed all day Sunday and will be closed every night during the entire exposition.  Captain W. V. Cox, secretary and executive officer of the board of management of the Government building, is authority for this statement.  The captain says the government has not "violated the sanctity of the Sabbath" at any exposition and no exception will be made on this occasion unless very great pressure is brought to bear upon the authorities in the east.</p>
                            <p>Captain Cox says the installation of exhibits and the preparation of the Government building for the inspectors of visitors will be completed by May 31, and the plan at present under consideration is to open the building informally at 4 o'clock on that day, inviting the officials of the exposition and their families, national, state and county officers, with their families and prominent citizens, to visit the building at that time and inspect the preparations which have been made by the various departments.</p>

                            <p>Acting in accordance with the old adage, "The early bird catches the worm," Thomas Cassidy of Chicago has had the foresight to hire all the carriages in the city which are available for the opening day parade and the many friends, whom he told the liverymen he is anxious to provide for on that day, will be sure of a ride.  If the exposition directors desire to ride and to furnish carriages for their distinguished guests who will be present on that day they will have to secure a place among Cassidy's friends.</p>
                            <p>All the liverymen in the city were asked to make a bid on furnishing conveyances for the exposition directors on June 1 and many of them sent in bids and heard no more from them.  While the committee was considering the question Cassidy was making hay and offered the various stables a good price for all the conveyances they can supply on that day.  Not having heard from the exposition people the liverymen did not know what the committee would do and grasped the opportunity to let their rigs for the day.  Cassidy explained to all of them that he had a number of Chicago friends, who are to be here on that day, and that he was interested in a firm in Chicago which has an exhibit at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The only accommodations which it can be found that the directors have provided for the day are three tallyho coaches.  Cassidy has been in the city about two months and has quarters at the Karbach hotel.  The liverymen say, however, that Cassidy engaged their conveyances only a few days ago.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Fifty Women en Route to Biennial Federation Meeting at Denver Will Assist at the Social Function.</head>
                            <p>The Wisconsin commissioners are preparing to make a great occasion out of the state days, June 17 and 18, at the exposition.  Chairman Koch of the commission has sent an outline of the arrangements to President Wattles.  He says that an excursion of Wisconsin people will leave Milwaukee the afternoon of the 16th and arrive in Omaha the following morning.  That day will be spent in viewing attractions, and Saturday formal exercises will be held.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Koch will make an address delivering the building to the governor of Wisconsin.  He will be responded to by either Governor Scofield or Lieutenant Governor Baensch, who will present the building to the exposition management.  The address for the exposition will probably be made by President Wattles, and then one of Wisconsin's best orators will deliver a general address.  In the evening the state commission will tender a reception to the public.  It will so happen that on this day about fifty Wisconsin women will be in the city on their way to attend the biennial meeting of the National Federation of Women's clubs at Denver, and they will be present at the reception to assist the commissioners.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Koch states that several of the commissioners will be here to witness the ceremonies of opening day.  Those who will surely come are the chairman and Messrs. J. H. Stout, H. D. Fisher, August Uihlein and A. C. Class.</p>

                            <p>Dick Smith has taken out a permit to erect a barn on the old fair grounds tract in which he will exhibit a horse of the longmaned variety.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Martha A. Shute of the Colorado commission arrived yesterday to superintend the installation of the horticultural display.</p>
                            <p>W. H. Allen of the Missouri commission was among yesterday's arrivals.  He is one of the subcommittee on mines and forestry, and has shipped a large exhibit of ore, zinc, spelter and clay products which he will install.</p>
                            <p>At a regular meeting of Inverness castle No. 60, Royal Highlanders, it was decided to look after and entertain all Highlanders visiting the exposition.  They can secure information by calling on Clansmen Elsasser, 213 South 14th street.  The meetings are held on the second and fourth Thursdays of the month.  All visiting clansmen will be welcome.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>One of the great features of the exposition will be the fireworks and spectaculars, that far excel anything that was ever attempted before at any exposition, Chicago not excepted.  This great feature is in the hands of America's greatest pyrotechnist, the A. L. Due Fireworks company of Cincinnati, O., and the J. Anthony Gorman Spectacular company.  The combining of these two companies of practical men, who have followed this line of business for the last twenty-five years, is a guarantee to visitors to the exposition company that they will see the greatest features ever attempted in this particular line.  The writer has the pleasure of seeing the interior of the great magazines and workshops that are now located on the exposition ground, where a score of skilled workmen are engaged in finishing the great pyrotechnic displays for the opening night of the exposition.  Mr. John Due, the expert pyrotechnist, who has charge of this part of the work, showed us the great sixty-inch shell, the latest invention of Mr. A. L. Due&#8212;something that never was fired before in any part of the world.  This great shell is fired in the air from a monster mortar, which represents one of our great coast defense guns; after exploding in the air, twenty great shells explode with deafening reports, and from them come twenty beautifully colored lights, showers of stars and darts that illuminate the sky for miles around.  We were next shown the many mechanical devices which are owned and used only by the A. L. Due company, representing figures, animals and various devices, that are perfect pictures.  We were then shown the construction of a great portrait.  Imagine a portrait sixty feet in diameter, constructed of fireworks, that, when lit, will show a perfect portrait of our president.  We next saw the portrait of our greatest naval hero, Admiral Dewey, wrapped in the Cuban flag and Old Glory, and guarded by our American emblem, the golden eagle.  We then saw the many other devices that will be seen for the first time in this country on Wednesday night, the opening night of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Gorman showed many of the drawings, photographs of the various spectaculars that will be produced here during the exposition, which are marvels of the artist's brain and genius.  None of them have ever been shown in any country before, and are especially prepared for the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>
                            <p>The fireworks and spectacular grounds are located back of the Old Plantation, and at the rear and side of the Transportation building, West Midway, where a great lake is being built and comfortable seats prepared for the public.</p>

                            <p>Grand pyrotechnical display in dedication of the opening night of the Trans-Mississippi <choice><sic>eposition</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;The commencement of the display to be heralded by the firing of three mammoth report shells, or aerial cannons, which will be heard for miles around five minutes before firing commences.</p>
                            <p>Second&#8212;Grand instantaneous illumination of the entire surroundings by means of the A. L. Due patent prismatic illuminators, lasting for several minutes and changing colors from time to time, consisting of fifty one-pound packages.</p>
                            <p>Third&#8212;A grand flight of fifty pieces of heavy display <choice><sic>or</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> public exhibition rockets, combining a wonderful combination of varied colors.</p>
                            <p>Fourth&#8212;A grand flight of six mammoth A. L. Due eighteen-inch shells.  These, after reaching their altitude, explode with a deafening report, realizing every color and effect imaginable.</p>
                            <p>Fifth&#8212;A beautiful large portrait of President McKinley, to whom all hearts are turning at the present moment.</p>
                            <p>Sixth&#8212;Device kaleidoscope.  This piece is represented by a huge wheel, with smaller wheels intermingled, and producing a wonderful variety of colorings, which constantly change their hues, and at the same time producing a change of form.</p>
                            <p>Seventh&#8212;A grand flight of fifteen pieces of four-inch heavy fancy display rockets; these are manufactured especially for large exhibition purposes, and will consist of a combination of mammoth peacock plume rockets.</p>
                            <p>Eighth&#8212;Flight of three pieces of thirty-inch mammoth A. L. Due shells.  This is one of the largest effects produced, and will illustrate some of our new colorings in aluminum and magnesia effects.</p>
                            <p>Ninth&#8212;Grand device, the fan stars.  This wonderful design is patented by our company and consists of a beautiful display of changing fireworks, gradually developing into a huge fan of all colors, and the star appears above the fan, and while revolving changes into various shapes.</p>
                            <p>Tenth&#8212;Grand flight of Saucission are fired from large waters, and after reaching their altitude explode with a large report, realizing a number of serpents, which go hurrying, scurrying through the air, terminating with a number of reports.</p>
                            <p>Eleventh&#8212;Flight of thirty-six-inch A. L. Due mammoth shell, which exploding at great height realizes many beautiful effects in variegated colors.</p>
                            <p>Twelfth&#8212;A grand flight, two pieces, A. L. Due patent combination shells.  These shells are one of the most wonderful productions of the pyrotechnic art.  The first shell on reaching its altitude explodes with a loud report, realizing innumerable stars of every hue, after which a second shell is realized, and extending still higher in the air in crimson color and producing a second exposition, which produces a new combination of colors.</p>
                            <p>Thirteenth&#8212;Grand flight of twelve pieces of four and six pound fancy exhibition rockets.  These are made especially for our display and combine and produce a display of richest colors and new effects.</p>
                            <p>Fourteenth&#8212;Grand flight of pigeons.  These are adjusted to wire cables and travel a distance of from 400 to 600 feet, and after reaching the destination, return to the starting point, which is repeated a number of times.  This is very effective, producing a startling and comical effect.</p>
                            <p>Fifteenth&#8212;A grand flight of six pieces of mammoth gold umbrellas.  These on reaching their altitude explode with a heavy report, and gradually reform themselves into a huge umbrella of liquid fire until reaching the ground.</p>
                            <p>Sixteenth&#8212;A grand flight of ten pieces of A. L. Due shells in every combination of colors.</p>

                            <p>Eighteenth&#8212;A magnificent display of water or marine fireworks, consisting of twelve large pieces of water mines, twenty-four pieces of golden fish.</p>
                            <p>Nineteenth&#8212;Portrait of our hero, Admiral Dewey&#8212;in the great shield, with golden spread eagle of our country, with the Cuban flag and Old Glory.</p>
                            <p>Twentieth&#8212;Device, acrobat.  This consists of one of our most effective patented comical pieces, and showing all the evolutions and performances of the horizontal bar performer; very comical and effective.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-first&#8212;A grand flight of two pieces of A. L. Due mammoth forty-five-inch shells.  These shells are the very largest that have been attempted by this country or any other country on the face of the globe, making a pyrotechnical display, and successfully produced by out company.  They are absolutely startling and indescribable in their effects.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-second&#8212;A grand flight of fifteen pieces, four and six pound fancy rockets, in our new aluminum and phosphorescent effects.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-third&#8212;Device, a fountain constructed in exact imitation of the beautiful fountain, in wonderful effects and colorings.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-fourth&#8212;A grand exhibition of six golden mammoth umbrellas.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-fifth&#8212;A grand flight of three pieces of A. L. Due thirty-inch mammoth shells.  These shells on reaching the altitude and exploding with tremendous force, will realize some of our new effects in aluminum and magnesia coloring.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-sixth&#8212;A grand cross fire of fifteen four and six pound fancy rockets in entirely new effects and colorings which have never been shown before, and only perfected by our company this season.  They will consist of the new effects in diamond chain, silver and gold, producing one of the greatest and most startling effects in colorings ever known to the art.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-seventh&#8212;Portrait of Nebraska's chief executive, Governor Holcomb.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-eighth&#8212;Grand flight of ten pieces of A. L. Due mammoth eighteen-inch shells.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-ninth&#8212;Grand cross fire of twenty-four two-pound fancy exhibition rockets in every combination of colors.</p>
                            <p>Thirtieth&#8212;A flight of twenty-five pieces large humming birds.  This is an entirely new effect in pyrotechnics, fired from the waters, and on reaching the altitude they fly through the air in an eccentric and comical manner, producing a sound in imitation of the humming birds.</p>
                            <p>Thirty-first&#8212;A grand device, the aluminum and shower wheel, consisting of a mammoth wheel, accompanied by a large number of cascades, throwing out a continual stream of silver fire and producing a grand and bewildering effect.</p>

                            <head type="sub">No Cessation from Labor Until Everything is in Place and Ready for the Visitors Who Arrive Next Wednesday.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There will be neither night nor day on the exposition grounds until the gates are opened in June 1 and the world is invited to see what has been done.  No visitors will be admitted to any part of the grounds and all the men who can be found seeking employment will be engaged on the grounds assisting in the work of preparation.  Carpenters, painters, mechanics of all kinds and laborers in profusion are required and all who come will be employed.  The grounds will be illuminated at night and the work will go on with several shifts of men without cessation.  The gates were closed last night and no one not having special business on the grounds will be admitted until the day set for the opening.</p>
                            <p>This course was decided upon by the executive committee yesterday afternoon, and the rule excluding visitors from the grounds will be enforced strictly.  There are several reasons for this action.  Chief among them is the fact that the crowds of visitors which have thronged every portion of the grounds during the last few days have interfered very seriously with the workmen in all lines.  The graders and pavers, the painters and decorators, the carpenters erecting booths, the exhibitors preparing their displays&#8212;all have been interfered with and delayed by the curious people crowding and pushing in every nook and corner, and the influx of the usual Sunday crowd threatened to prove a serious problem.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Reasons for the Order.</head>
                            <p>Another reason for closing the grounds was the fact that the exhibitors are compelled to have their material strewn all about and the temptation seemed to be too great for some of the people with kleptomania.  A number of small things have disappeared the last few days, and this added more weight to the argument in favor of closing the grounds entirely.</p>
                            <p>Still another reason in the same direction is found in the well known fact that an exhibit in course of preparation is never seen to the best advantage, and it was thought only fair to exhibitors to give them an opportunity to make their preparations with as much privacy as may be.</p>
                            <p>At the hour of noon on May 30 the gates will be closed against the receipt of any more exhibits or materials and the remaining time until the morning of June 1 will be devoted to cleaning up and adding the finishing touches to the exhibits.  The Department of Exhibits will go through every building and see that every exhibit is making the proper progress.  Anything that is in the least objectionable will be removed and a general supervision will be exercised to assure the completeness of each building.</p>
                            <p>Exhibitors who have been delayed in arriving have been communicated with and the Exhibits department has assurances that all will be on hand in time for the opening.  Every space will be occupied and the buildings will present the most attractive and inviting appearance.</p>
                            <p>The repairs to the lagoon have been completed and the water was turned on last night.  About forty-eight hours will be required to fill the big basin, as the water is not allowed to run "full head" at night on account of possible fires requiring more pressure.</p>
                            <p>The railing on the permanent bridges across the lagoon at Twentieth street is being put in place and preparations have been made for laying the top covering on the cement base forming the floors of these bridges.  The grading of the approaches to the bridges is about completed and the laying of the macadam covering has been commenced.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">Quality of the Exhibits.</head>
                            <p>Each exhibitor has been envious of the other, which has added greatly to the elaborateness of the displays, each one trying to outdo his brother.</p>
                            <p>In some points many think the exhibits excel those of the World's fair, and especially is this so in the Fine Arts building.  Here, one is not permitted to gaze upon such a large collection of pictures as was shown at the World's fair, but there is an absence of many inferior works of art which marked the display there.  No finer collection has been shown to the public, comprising works from the brush and pen of all well known artists.</p>
                            <p>Director Griffith is one of the busiest men on the ground and he says the opening day will see everything in readiness for the sightseeing of the public.</p>
                            <p>The various buildings are being decorated profusely on the overhead stringers with flags, while on the side supports in the galleries are hung large pictures corresponding with the products contained in the buildings.</p>
                            <p>Oregon, Nevada, Kansas and Texas are new states represented in the Agricultural hall, and their booths and exhibits compare favorably with those preceding them.  All these will be entirely installed by Tuesday night.  The Manufactures building presents a much confused appearance, but not so to the workmen and exhibitors.  The floor space is entirely used and causes one to think that those engaged therein would not have room enough to turn around in.  This promises to be an interesting room to visitors.  In the gallery the Nebraska educational exhibit is fast being displayed, under the direction of Assistant Stewart.  A number of the counties have sent representatives to assist in the work.</p>
                            <p>To note the progress that can be made "on the spur of the moment" one has only to visit the Transportation building.  A few days ago it contained but few exhibits; now it is nearly filled and by Monday it is expected to be complete.  The latest visitor to take up its abode for five months is the monster Northern Pacific railway engine No. 168, which was built especially for show at the exposition.  It is a ten-wheel compound engine and is in charge of Charles F. Page.</p>

                            <p>Assistant Postmaster Woodard was at the Government building yesterday looking over the accommodations which are being arranged for the branch postoffice which will be established in that building for serving the entire exposition grounds.  The office will be established in a room which has been prepared at the back of the middle section of the building, a room 32x10 feet having been made for the purpose.  In this will be established a complete postoffice with facilities for issuing money orders, selling stamps, postal cards, etc.  Two clerks will be in charge of the office and five carriers will distribute mail to all parts of the grounds.  Twenty-five different letter boxes will be established at different points on the grounds and three or four deliveries will be made each day as circumstances may require.  The office will be opened for business June 1 and will continue until the close of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Officials Express Their Satisfaction&#8212;Night Turned Into Day.</head>
                            <p>At the exposition power house the electric current was turned on last night at 8:45 o'clock for a test of all the lights on the main court.</p>
                            <p>A number of people were present, among them being a number of exposition officials, to witness the initial illumination of the main court.  The system is divided into four sections, and all had been tested separately, but last night was the first combined test.  The effect was grand and called forth much praise from those who witnessed the illumination.  The court was made as light as day and people walking at the most extreme end of the court were plainly discernible from the viaduct at the east end.</p>
                            <p>Some 11,000 lights of twenty candle power each are brought into use on the court.  This is the first time in the history of an exposition that lighting the main court has been attempted, as it was thought an impossibility.  Superintendent Foster expressed himself as being well pleased with the test, which he said was satisfactory in every particular.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exercises for Two Days Planned by the State Commission.</head>
                            <p>An outline of the program for the two days in June selected as "Wisconsin days," has been received from President J. C. Koch and it indicates that the people of that section intend to make the occasion a most notable one.  According to the plan outlined by the president of the Wisconsin commission, an excursion of Wisconsin people will leave Milwaukee the evening of June 16 and arrive in Omaha the next morning.  The president writes that present indications are that there will be a large crowd from Wisconsin on this excursion.  The 17th will be spent in looking over the grounds and the city generally, and the formal exercises of the occasion will transpire on Saturday, the 18th.  These will take place in the Wisconsin building and the president of the commission will make a short address formally turning over the building to Governor Schofield or Lieutenant Governor Baensch.  The governor will accept the building and will then formally turn it over to the exposition authorities.  President Wattles will accept the structure in the name of the exposition management.  Following these formalities one of Wisconsin's most noted orators will make a short address, taking for his subject the relations of Wisconsin to the transmississippi region.  The speaker will also speak at some length regarding the fiftieth anniversary of Wisconsin's admission to the union and the occasion will be made to celebrate of this noted event in the history of the state.  An original poem by a Wisconsin poet will be one of the features of the occasion.</p>
                            <p>These exercises will take place in the afternoon and the evening will be devoted to a public reception in the state building, to be followed by a dance.</p>
                            <p>To add to the attractiveness and interest of the occasion, fifty women delegates from Wisconsin to the annual meeting of the Confederation of Women's clubs to be held at Denver will take part in the exercises in connection with the formal dedication of the building and will also attend the "Omaha prelude" to the federation meeting which will take place June 18 and 19.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the attendance of Wisconsin people on the occasion of the dedication of the state building, President Koch says several members of the commission as well as many other people from that state, will be present on the occasion of the formal opening of the exposition.  The members of the commission who will surely be here, as stated by the president, are as follows: President J. C. Koch, J. H. Stout, H. D. Fisher, Aug. Uihlein and A. C. Clas.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Pyrotechnic Features to Be Displayed Free of Charge.</head>
                            <p>One of the most attractive features of the provisions made for the entertainment of visitors to the exposition at night will be the fireworks and pyrotechnic displays which will take place on specially prepared ground directly east of the Transportation building.  No charge will be made for witnessing these displays and every facility will be provided to enable the people to enjoy the many novelties to the utmost.</p>
                            <p>A small lake about 200x400 feet has been prepared for these displays.  On the south side of the lake seats will be arranged where a full view may be had of the display which will take place on the opposite side.  Here will be displayed all the novelties known to the art of the expert pyrotechnist.  There will be displays spectacular and displays comical.  There will not be any ordinary fireworks, but everything will be of the highest order of excellence and the modern development in the science of explosives will be utilized to the fullest extent.</p>
                            <p>The preparation of these displays is carried on in a couple of small buildings in the extreme northeastern corner of the north tract where a force of expert pyrotechnists are engaged in preparing the numerous devices of all kinds which are warranted to excite the admiration of the most blase cosmopolitan.</p>
                            <p>Bombs of mammoth size, rockets of all kinds, umbrellas, fountains, humming birds, etc., will be used in profusion and numerous mechanical effects are produced in a variety of ways.</p>
                            <p>An exceptionally fine display of fireworks has been arranged for the opening night and this will commence about 9 o'clock after the close of the concert in the Auditorium.</p>

Those who are not present at this rehearsal will not receive a ticket to these concerts and will not be able to obtain admission to the Auditorium without paying the regular price of admission.</p>
                            <p>By special request from the director of the Thomas orchestra the Exposition chorus will appear at the concert to be given in the Auditorium Wednesday evening by the orchestra.  The latter will play a number of which the "Star Spangled Banner" will form a feature and the director has requested that the chorus be prepared to sing this portion of the number.  This will be taken up for rehearsal Tuesday night.</p>
                            <p>The names of a portion of the soloists who will appear in concerts in the Auditorium on the exposition grounds during June have been made public by Musical Director Kimball, as follows:  Miss Helen Buckley, Miss Anna Metcalfe, Miss Jennie Osborne, Miss Jessie Campbell, Mme.

                            <p>June 18 is to be Woman's club day at the exposition and preparations are going forward for the entertainment of the large number of guests which is expected.  Delegates en route to the biennial meeting of the General Federation of Women's clubs at Denver are coming from Boston, Philadelphia, New York, St. Louis, Chicago and St. Paul, and the federations of neighboring states are preparing to meet them.  The guests will arrive on Saturday morning and will spend the day on the exposition grounds.  A program will be given at the Auditorium in the afternoon at which Mrs. Mary E. Mumford of Philadelphia will speak on some phase of education and Mrs. Hermann Hall of Chicago will give an address on "Art in the Home, the School and the Community."  Other speakers during the sessions of the two days during which the women will be here are Mrs. Cornelius Stevenson of Philadelphia, Mrs. Ellen M. Richardson of Boston, Mrs. W. E.

                            <p>All of the offices of the exposition will be removed to the grounds today and business will open Monday morning with all the departments on the grounds except the Department of Publicity and Promotion.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Ways and Means, including the secretary's office and the Bureau of Admissions, will be located in the Service building.  The Transportation and Concessions departments will also have offices in this building, while the Department of Exhibits will retain the offices in the Manufactures building which have been occupied by the department for the last two weeks.</p>
                            <p>The Service building has not been entirely completed, but it was decided that the headquarters of the various departments must be established on the grounds before the exposition opens and Sunday appeared to be the only time when the moving could be accomplished without the loss of valuable time from a working day.</p>
                            <p>The Service building is located immediately north of the Administration arch on the west side of Twentieth street.  It is about as near the center of the grounds as any spot which might be selected and will be convenient of access from any portion of the three tracts.  The offices of President Wattles and General Manager Clarkson will be in the Administration arch.</p>

                            <p>The hanging of the paintings which constitute a prominent feature of the decoration of the Nebraska building is proceeding rapidly under the supervision of Miss Mellona Butterfield, the hostess of the building.  The paintings are all the work of Nebraska artists or those who claim this state as their home.  Some of the artists have taken up their abode in other climes, but still cling to the old state as their home.  The pictures cover a wide range of subjects, including landscapes, flowers in profusion, portraits and one or two very ambitious efforts in the nude.  In the latter class is one life-size figure of a young girl painted by an Omaha woman.  The work is exceptionally fine and already the picture has attracted the most favorable comment from connoisseurs.</p>

                            <p>The Board of Management of the Government building and exhibit held a protracted meeting at the Millard hotel last night and transacted a large amount of routine business.  The only matter of interest done by the board was to fix the hours during which the building shall be kept open.  It was decided that during June and July the building will be open from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m.  During the remaining months the hours will be gradually shortened, the aim being to close about sundown.</p>
                            <p>The question of opening the building on Sundays was mentioned, but the consensus of opinion was that the decision made by practically the same board at the World's fair should be adhered to and the building will not be opened Sundays.</p>
                            <p>J. B. Morrey, who has been in charge of the installation of the exhibit of the Treasury department, was appointed superintendent of exhibits for the entire building.</p>

                            <p>Luther M. Stieringer, the electrical engineer who designed the electric decoration of the exposition grounds, has arrived in the city to oversee the addition of the finishing touches to the grounds and will remain for some time.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Martha Shute, the energetic commissioner of horticulture of Colorado, has arrived with the material for her exhibit and the installation will be commenced at once and pushed to an early completion with Mrs. Shute's usual energy.</p>

Although jewels, laces and silken trains were conspicuously absent, the white brilliancy of the expansive fronts and the graceful cut of the swallowtails made very good substitutes.  Mr. Wattles was assisted in entertaining by Messrs.  Reed, Babcock, Hitchcock and Kirkendall.</p>
                            <p>As the guests entered the beautiful hall of the new residence they were greeted by strains of entrancing music coming from an orchestra hidden behind a screen of palms.  The hall mantel was heaped with jack roses and ferns.  La France roses were scattered in great profusion through the parlors.  The decorations of the dining room were red.  An immense mound of red roses graced the center of the polished mahogany table and here elegant refreshments were served.  A huge punch bowl wreathed with American beauties occupied a place of honor in the billiard room on the third floor.  Somewhat over 200 guests were present.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The decoration of the interior of the Government building has been completed and the handsome effect produced by the harmonious arrangement of color is the subject of flattering comment on the part of the few visitors who have been privileged to enter the building.  The members of the board of <choice><sic>managment</sic><corr>management</corr></choice> are greatly pleased with the result, several of them declaring that the decoration of the interior, like the building itself, is far superior to any previous effort in that direction in former expositions.</p>
                            <p>Before the decorators commenced their work, the building presented the appearance of an immense warehouse, the side walls being "sheathed" with wide boards, and the view from any point being broken by huge columns supporting the great roof trusses.  The dome was a vision of bare boards, reaching to a height of 150 feet above the floor.  This is all changed now, and on every side the eye beholds the beautiful colors of "Old Glory" arranged against a pleasing background of maroon and old gold.  The trusses are hidden from view, the columns are covered with pleasing shadows of cloth and the yawning dome is changed to a burst of color, which forms a fitting climax in the elaborate scheme.  The side walls are covered to a height of twelve feet, with maroon-colored burlap, and from this point to the ceiling the unsightly boards are covered with burlap of the natural color.  A neat moulding in black covers the joining of these colors.  The roof trusses are hidden from view by graceful festoons or maroon and old gold cloth.  Each massive post is covered with burlap, the joining of the colors being marked by a handsome moulding in black.</p>
                            <p>At the crown of each of the trusses marking the commencement of the wings at either side of the central mass of the building is a "trophy" consisting of two twenty-two foot flags, two twelve-foot flags and two eight-foot flags, artistically arranged and draped, and in the center of this beautiful background appears a large American eagle, with wings extended and grasping in his talons the olive branch and bunch of arrows.  At the crown of each of the other trusses is a similar "trophy" without the eagle.  On each column supporting the roof trusses a trophy of smaller flags is arranged at the moulding heretofore mentioned.</p>

                            <p>The arrangement of the dome is the crowning feature of the beautiful decoration.  The bare boards forming the sides of the dome have disappeared behind a covering of burlap of the natural color and the lofty crown appears in a blaze of red and white draped in the most artistic fashion.  The broad bands of red and white extend from the outer circle to the center and are draped in such a manner that the result must be seen to be appreciated.  A frieze of blue around the outer circle completes the tri-color and serves to cover the method of fastening.  At the base of the dome trophies of flags are draped entirely around the great circle, the group opposite the main entrance being marked by a huge silver shield bearing the letters "U. S." in gold.</p>
                            <p>The State department is immediately beneath the dome opposite the main entrance to the building, and above this, adding to the general effect of the decoration, is the seal of the United States, surmounted by artistically draped flags.</p>
                            <p>The extensive exhibit of the Treasury department is marked by a trophy mounted on one of the iron columns supporting the dome, comprising the flags of the various branches under the direction of the department, including the revenue marine service, the customs service, the marine hospital service, the life saving service, etc.  Not the least important feature which adds to the general decoration is the great light house lens which has been erected in the center of the dome.  The myriad prisms forming this light have been polished until they are without a spot or speck of dust and the beautiful colors of the decoration are reflected from their polished sides in thousands of rays.</p>

                            <p>The case of the proprietors of the Streets of Cairo against the proprietors of the Streets of All Nations at the exposition, wherein the plaintiffs seek to restrain the defendants from exhibiting camels and donkeys as a feature of their show, is on before Judge Scott, with a possibility that it will consume considerable time.</p>
                            <p>Upon the convening of court the defendant, by their attorney, moved the removal of the case to the United States circuit court, alleging that all the parties to the action are nonresidents of the state and that therefore the local courts have no jurisdiction.  Judge Scott intimated that there was some legal merit in this contention, but said that if a removal should be ordered it would deprive the plaintiffs of all of their legal remedies, as the defendants as well as the plaintiffs would leave the state upon the close of the exposition and before the case could be heard.  Taking this view of the case, the court ordered the hearing to proceed, saying that he would take the removal application under advisement and pass upon it at a later date.</p>
                            <p>The entire afternoon was spent in reading affidavits of parties to the concession and at 6 o'clock Judge Scott, seeing that there was no possibility of finishing the testimony without running late into the night, ordered a continuance until next Tuesday morning.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, May 27.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;For the first time in several years the Marine band, attached to the Marine barracks, in the City of Washington, will go outside of the capital city for any length of time.  During the days of the Nashville exposition the band was permitted to give two concerts in that city.  It was also allowed to participate in the Chicago horse show, but not since Sousa left it has it been permitted to accept any engagements extending over any considerable length of time until Senator Thurston and the members of the Nebraska delegation in congress succeeded in inducing the president to change his decision that the band should not go to Omaha to participate in the opening of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  While to the residents of Washington the band of the United States Marine corps would appear to have existed since the foundation of the government, in point of fact, this famous organization is not yet 100 years old.  It was some time after, or about the time of the war of 1812, that a small band of Italian musicians was landed upon American shores and induced to take service at the marine headquarters in this city.  The little band of those days formed the <choice><sic>neuclus</sic><corr>nucleus</corr></choice> of the present famous American organization, which has grown and changed in its nationality, fluctuating in is characteristics, according to the moulding influence of the <choice><sic>controling</sic><corr>controlling</corr></choice> power which ruled its destiny.  At one time the membership was even greater than at the present date, but the larger organization had but a brief, though brilliant, existence.  At present the force consists of fifty musicians, all of whom are well trained and thoroughly competent to perform the exacting duties required of them by the band master.  The band is not only a band of the United States Marine corps, but it is the president's band, and the band which gives summer concerts three times each week to the public of Washington at the White House grounds, in the east front of the capitol, and at the Marine barracks.  It is perhaps through these concerts, as much as anything, that the band has become more widely known throughout the country than in any of its other functions, but probably it was through its Saturday concerts in the "White Lot" that the band firmly established itself in the hearts of the Washington populace, as well as in the hearts of the thousands of visitors who are constantly inspecting the sights of this American capital.  The small world of Washington was usually in attendance upon these Saturday afternoon concerts in front of the president's mansion, and there is no more charming nor picturesque spot in all the District of Columbia than the same "White Lot," as the grounds are called back of the White House.  The band men in their red and white uniforms sit on a low, temporary platform in the middle of the lawn facing the White House.  On the green sit and walk 10,000 to 15,000 people of all ages, sexes and conditions.  A little valley stretches its green velvet carpet from the stand down to the shores of the Potomac, beyond rise the hills of Virginia, and Arlington, the home of the Lees, now the resting place of thousands dead, is seen peeping over the green hills.  As the shadows deepen and the sun seeks its home in the west, the grass grows damp with the <unclear reason="torn"/> day and the Marine band, with <unclear reason="torn"/> Banner."  The audience rise as the inspired strain floats over the White Lot and the heads of the people and is lost in the darkening shadows along the shores of the Potomac, and it is this band which has the distinguished honor of opening the exposition at Omaha on the first day of June.</p>
                            <ab>* * *</ab>
                            <p>There have been many changes in the personnel of the leadership of the band since its organization in the stressful days of 1812, many of the leaders coming to the band famous for their ability to direct a great musical organization, while many of the leaders left the band with fame which they had won by ability in musical direction.  The present leader, William H. Santelmann, was born in the city of Hanover, Germany, and comes from a long line of musical ancestors.  At a very early age he began the study of the violin under competent instructors, and when fourteen years old took up harmony and instrumentation.  Four years later he enlisted in a military band at Leipsic, serving three years, at the expiration of which time he entered the Conservatory of Music in that city for the purpose of completing his education.  The years spent in Leipsic were most fruitful in opportunities for hearing the finest music and gaining experience in all branches of his profession.  Immediately after the close of his course in the conservatory, Mr. Santelmann accepted an engagement to go to Philadelphia with a concert band, and one year later was received into the band of the United States Marine corps,  In 1895 he withdrew from the Marine band and organized an orchestra of his own, which met with signal success at the various social events of the city at which it performed.  In March of the present year he received the appointment he now holds.  The personal popularity of Mr. Santelmann is such that his appointment was hailed with delight by the old members of the band who had known him throughout his American career, and many of the retired members who had been comrades with him under John Philip Sousa have again put on the uniform under his leadership.  He is magnetic, vigorous and full of fire as a conductor, while his thorough knowledge of instrumentation give the judgment necessary to understand the capacity of his players and the capabilities of each instrument.  While Mr. Santelmann has never been brought into prominence as a composer, a number of his compositions have achieved marked success wherever performed.</p>
                            <ab>***</ab>
                            <p>To mention each of the members of this great band would require quite a small volume if all the laurels which they have won as individuals were to be considered.  The Assistant Leader Mr. Walter F. Smith, has seen considerable experience with the Marine band previous to his present connection.  For a number of years Mr. Smith was solo cornetist and assistant leader under Mr. John Philip Sousa's leadership.  Later he was for three years with Sousa's Concert band and now has recently returned to his former place in the band, through the strongest respect and esteem which its present leader commands from all who know him thoroughly.  Mr. Smith is a western man, coming from the state of Michigan.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Larsen, the first cornetist of the band, is a graduate from a European conservatory of music, and has recently had the honor of being acting leader of the band previous to Mr. Santelmann's appointment.  He is a thorough musician and a favorite in the city of Washington.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jaeger, the flute soloist of the band, needs no introduction since his reputation is spread all over the country.  Besides being a great soloist, Mr. Jaeger enjoys the distinction of being the owner of the only solid gold flute that has ever been made, and which he uses on rare occasions for solo playing.</p>
                            <p>Josef Oliveri, the solo clarinetist of the band, was a native of the city of Palermo, in Sicily, and it is possible that the warm sun and mellow wines of that island may have had their influence upon the playing of his instrument, for seldom it is that a richer tone or more delicate execution can be heard from any artist upon this difficult instrument.  He is also one of the "old stand-by's" in the band.</p>
                            <p>F. Patzchke, who plays the oboe, is a Pole, but plays this eccentric instrument as though it might have been an aeolian harp instead.</p>
                            <p>Signor Licarione, the first tuba player, is a native of the mountains of Calarbria, in Italy, while Signor Giovannini, the euphonium soloist, comes from one of the Italian cantons of Switzerland.  Signor Giovannini is especially remarkable for the broad, full tone which he produces upon this instrument, and is a very popular soloist in the capital city.  Mr. Samuels, the first trumpet player, is truly one of the veterans of the organization.  Besides having served nearly thirty years in the Marine band, he has spent eight years in the British navy.  Mr. Samuels is a native of the Island of Malta.</p>
                            <p>Louis Tilleux is a Frenchman and ex-member of the Grand Opera House band, Paris, where he was famous as a horn soloist.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Werres, the bassoon player, Mr. John Linder, the saxophone soloist, and many others of the band contribute to its success with well-earned laurels in their individual capacities.  And it may be said that the fame of this organization rests more upon the unity and the faithfulness with which each man has done his part than upon the luster which surrounds one or two bright stars whose glory eclipses all else.</p>

                            <p>Notwithstanding the announcement that the exposition would be closed absolutely to all visitors several thousand people wended their way in that direction bright and early yesterday morning and laid siege to the numerous gates and openings in the five miles of fence which surround the grounds.  The gates where tickets have been sold were locked and the usual pass gates were in charge of keepers, but there appeared to be about a thousand other means of ingress to the grounds and the over-curious people found them first.  Fully 2,000 people found their way into the grounds before noon and the exposition treasury was not enriched 1 cent by the operation.  Where they gained admission no one seemed to know, but they were there and they seemed to take particular delight in taunting the gatekeepers with that fact.  The gatemen had no authority to put the visitors out and they remained until their inclinations led them to go out.</p>
                            <p>About noon a number of guards and watchmen were put on duty and every opening in the fence was closed.  The stream of visitors was stopped and the grounds looked deserted.  The workmen had the grounds and buildings all to themselves and they made the most of the welcome relief from the throngs of curious sightseers who had been passing back and forth.</p>
                            <p>The main court is almost ready for opening day.  Looking down the court from either end the view is unbroken by any unfinished work, with the exception of the bridges at Twentieth street, the island and the approaches at either side of the bridges.  This work is being pushed with all possible rapidity.  As many men as can work to advantage on the bridges are employed in putting on the railing and laying the floors.  On the island a number of men and several teams are scraping and levelling the ground preparatory to transforming the whole into a beauty spot.  The temporary wooden bridges have disappeared and several workmen are completing the heavy balustrade, which will extend entirely around the island.  The uncompleted approaches at either side of the lagoon at Twentieth street are crowded with men and teams completing the work, which has been delayed by the slowness of the bridge builders.  This work is making very rapid progress and it will be fully completed before the opening day.</p>

                            <p>At the east end of the main court, just in front of the broad entrance beneath the pavillion at the center of the eastern exedra, the speakers' stand, on which the opening exercises will take place, is being erected.  This stand will be fifty feet in length and will completely close this entrance to the ground.  Settees have been arranged at this point for the accommodation of a small portion of the crowds which will throng this portion of the grounds and a sweeping machine was engaged all day in sweeping form the newly laid brick pavement the sand which has made walking a task.</p>
                            <p>At the west end of the main court a gang of workmen were engaged in adding the finishing touches to the beautiful fountain which has been constructed at the west side of the Mirror.  The emptying of the lagoon last week was a fortunate circumstance for the contractors on this work, as it enabled them to work to better advantage.  The fountain is completed and when the lagoon is filled to the limit and the water is turned into the fountain, visitors to the grounds will be treated to a rare sight which will be a rare event.  The fountain is a most elaborate affair, depending for its effects upon the use of water and not upon the happy arrangement of statuary.  At night, by the aid of electricity, the column of water will be made a wonderful blaze of prismatic <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>The workmen in the main buildings were most thankful for the freedom from interruption with which they were favored after the holes in the fences had been closed and the crowds of people had disappeared.  The exhibitors were enabled to proceed without the annoyance of people running over their goods and knocking things about and the progress made was increased in a marked degree.  In all of the buildings many of the exhibitors have practically completed their displays and are taking their own time to add the few finishing touches necessary to give the exhibits the best possible appearance.  Those who are not ready are making the most of every moment and there is no longer any doubt but that all will be in complete readiness on the opening day and that every foot of space will be filled.</p>
                            <p>The Bluff tract is far advanced for the opening day and aside from a few state buildings, in entirely completed.</p>
                            <p>The band stand on the grand plaza is completed.  It is a structure fifty-eight feet high, but the rotunda is only about half of that.  It will be lighted from the center by a large cluster of incandescent electric lights, while around the arch are distributed similar lights.  The United States Marine band of Washington will be the first to occupy the stand.</p>

                            <p>The magnificent Horticultural building presents some of the most attractive features of the exposition.  One of these is the Chimes of the States.  From its belfry every evening a chime will be rung.  In this building there promises to be a fine display of both horticulture and floriculture and already great efforts along this line have been made.  The products of the states of the great west will reveal wonders to the visitors from the east and south.</p>
                            <p>The finishing touches are being given to the Nebraska state building and those in charge will have the satisfaction of completing all the details today.  The formal opening of the building will take place Wednesday, when Governor Silas A. Holcomb will be present to inspect the same.  From nearly every point of observation Nebraska has a building of which its citizens may well be proud.  The beautiful tinting of the interior, the elegant window and curtain drapings, together with the comfortable arrangement of the rooms, makes it a most home-like place.  There are smoking or lounging rooms, receptions rooms, and toilets, all being nicely equipped with comfortable furniture.  The various secret orders of the state, together with the exposition club organizations, have rooms and floor space in the building.  The governor's suite on the second floor consists of a private and reception room, commodiously arranged.  Three pianos will afford opportunity for the musically inclined to cause the air to resound with melodious notes.  Many people who have visited this building are first under the impression that they are in that of the Fine Arts.  This is caused by the profuse display of paintings from Nebraskans, all of which adds a richness to the interior decoration.  A postoffice will be conducted, where all Nebraska exposition visitors may secure mail.</p>

This charge will entitle the camera to admission to the grounds, but the bearer of the instrument will be required to have a separate admission ticket.  The camera ticket, however, will entitle the operator to the use of the "dark room" in the photograph pavillion at the northeast corner of the main court, between the Machinery and Electricity building and the Girls' and Boys' building.  A dark room in this building will be equipped for the use of those who desire to load their cameras of plate-holders and plenty of room will be provided.  The room will be about sixteen feet in length and a table extending the entire length of the room will be provided with a "red light" for each operator.

                            <p>The Illinois State building occupies the choicest position of any on the bluff tract.  From the east veranda one is permitted to look out over the broad Missouri river and the country roundabout while from the west is given a splendid view of the other state building, the Horticultural building, East Midway and a portion of the main court.  Illinois' building is a magnificent edifice of homelike appearance on the interior.  The floors are covered with elegant velvet carpet of green and old gold hues with the exception of the rotunda, which is of mosaic design.  There are reception rooms, banquet hall, sleeping apartments nicely furnished for use in case the governor or any of the commission may wish to spend only a night at the exposition.  There are toilets and a bath room.  The windows are covered with lace curtains, while the main rooms are furnished with easy rocking chairs and settees.  The building is entirely completed and Major Hamilton, secretary of the commission, is expected to arrive from Chicago tomorrow to remain for an indefinite time.</p>
                            <p>East Midway and West Midway will be ready to "take in" the first coin.  There will be entertainments for every class from the gaiety resort to that of a ride up into the air or down into the water, all ranging in price from a nickel to a quarter for each "clip."  The wild west of the early day is pictured from real life, the cowboys and Indians forming the principal attraction.  The wild animals roaring in their strongly barred cages is indicative of a part of the big show.  The great naval battle of the '60's to be fought over again and you can almost hear the boom of the cannon as it resounded off the ocean's water years ago.  The negroes will make merry music to the twang of the banjo.  The Streets of All Nations and Streets of Cairo with their many turbaned habitues from the Orient will afford many different modes of amusement.  The Chinese and Japanese people will try to instill into the minds of their American brother the use of good teas, etc., by practical tests.</p>

                            <p>Advice has been received from the Postoffice department at Washington that the mail will be supplied to the Exposition station by the regulation wagon contractor, who has charge of the transportation of all mails in the city.  According to his contract he is required to supply all stations established at the time the contract was drawn up and any others which may be established from time to time.  The department provides that four trips a day will be made on week days and two trips on Sunday.  It is not known by the Omaha department how the mail will be carried to the grounds as that matter rests entirely with the contractor, and he can carry it either on street cars or wagons, as he may choose.</p>
                            <p>Twenty-five letter boxes will be installed on the exposition grounds tomorrow.  A box will be placed on each of the main buildings, one in each of the state buildings and several will be located at different points along the amusement section of the Bluff tract, and in the Midway proper.  Everything will be in readiness at the exposition station and the first delivery will be <choice><sic>madeon</sic><corr>made on</corr></choice> Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>Postmaster Martin received a letter from Washington this morning stating that it would be impossible to issue the exposition stamps to postmasters until June 15, instead of June 1, as was previously announced.  The letter also stated that it had been found necessary to change the color of the $1 stamp from light brown to black and the $2 stamp will be light brown instead of sapphire blue.  Nor orders for less than ten 50-cent stamps or five $1 or $2 stamps will be received and orders which are not sent on the form known as form 3201-Omaha, will be ignored.</p>

                            <p>The salt water fish for the aquarium of the Fish commission in the Government building, arrived and have been placed in the tanks prepared for them.  There are all kinds of uncanny and strange forms and this portion of <choice><sic>theaquarium</sic><corr>the aquarium</corr></choice> will probably attract the greater share of attention.  The full list of salt water fish includes the following varieties:  Sea raven, sea robin, toad fish, tom cod, common cod, hake, mummery chuck, striped minnows, lobster, blue crab, spider crab, hermit crab, perriwinkle, conch, sea urchins, sea anemones, star fish, king crab, barn door skate, common skate, eel, sea bass, striped bass, tautog, flat fish, four-spot flounder, common flounder, gunnen, sea cucumbers, squirrel hake.  There are also the eggs of the squid and the skate.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday was moving day for the office of Secretary Wakefield, the Bureau of Admissions and the Concessions department.  All of these moved their effects to the grounds and took possession of the offices in the Service building which will be occupied by them during the entire exposition.  None of the offices were finished.  The large room to be occupied by the secretary and his office force is in a more advanced state than any of the others, but the carpenters hold full possession.  The carpenters were erecting partitions and screens to keep the curious public from trampling the office force under foot and they solemnly promised to finish their work inside of twenty-four hours and decamp.</p>
                            <p>The Bureau of Admissions met with a similar experience and the Concessions department had no advantage over the others.  The rooms assigned to the Transportation department are on the second floor and these were still in the possession of the plasterers, so that no attempt was made to occupy them.  The rooms will be ready for occupancy some time Tuesday.</p>

                            <p>The exposition offices in the Service building are in a state of confusion with the mixture of clerks and carpenters.  The latter are rushing their work as fast as possible and expect to have the interior of the offices completed within a few hours, but the difficulties of transacting business under the circumstances are almost insurmountable.</p>
                            <p>The secretary's office, the Bureau of Admissions and the Concessions department are the only offices in the building which are occupied.  The offices of the Transportation department are being finished as fast as possible, but Manager Babcock stated that he did not know just when he would be able to transfer his headquarters to the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee will meet at the grounds hereafter, instead of at the Millard hotel.  The hour of the meeting has been changed to 4 o'clock and for the present the meetings will be held in the Administration Arch.</p>

                            <p>Another consignment of fresh water fish was received yesterday morning at the Government building.  A car of the Fish commission from Quincy, Ill., with a number of fish from the government hatching station at that point and Superintendent Dean of the Neosho, Mo., station brought a number of fish from that point.</p>
                            <p>The consignment included about 1,000 fish of the following varieties:  Buffalo, large cat, sturgeon, carp, white perch, white bass, yellow bass, crappie, calico bass, black bass, drum fish, dog fish, golden tench, English tench, gold fish, golden ide, gar pike, rainbow trout, lake trout, brook trout, crawfish, common turtles, snappers and soft shell turtle.</p>
                            <p>These new arrivals were immediately placed in the tanks already prepared for them and in the large pools at the corners of the aquarium, which are lighted from beneath by electricity.</p>

A reply from Mr. Bryan, just received, states that the regiment has not yet reached the point where it could make an appearance in public, but the colonel writes that he will be happy to accept the invitation to participate in the luncheon which is to be served to the guests of the exposition at the close of the opening exercises and make an address at that time.

                            <p>The Girls' and Boys' building is being pushed to completion and it will be ready for occupancy about Tuesday noon.</p>
                            <p>Colonel C. E. Hambleton, secretary of the Illinois commission, has arrived in the city, accompanied by Mrs. Hambleton, and they have taken possession of the Illinois building on the bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>John Laughland, secretary of the Associated Charities, telegraphed to President Wattles that the National Conference of Charities and Correction will meet in Omaha the second week in September.</p>
                            <p>Word has been received at exposition headquarters that a large delegation of citizens from Randolph, Ia., will arrive in Omaha Wednesday morning headed by a band from that place.  A place in the parade is requested for the band.</p>
                            <p>A formal reservation of the space in the exposition buildings by the state of Washington was made this morning, 500 feet being reserved in the Mines building and a similar amount in the Forestry section.  Space was also reserved for the Washington building on the bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>The water was turned into the lagoon yesterday morning and the big basin is rapidly filling up.  The supply pipe is at the extreme east end of the lagoon and the amount of water pouring through the six-inch opening is sufficient to fill the lagoon within thirty-six hours if allowed to run at full head.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen has notified President Wattles that he will be unable to be in Omaha on the opening day of the exposition to take part in the exercises.  The letter of the senator explaining his absence and expressing his sentiments regarding the occasion of the opening has not yet been received, but is expected to reach this city tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>The children who are entitled to admission tickets to the exposition as payment for selling 100 or more copies of the Hatchet can get them at the Young Men's Christian association building this afternoon between 4 and 6 o'clock.  The due bill which was given when the papers were sold must be presented and the ticket will be exchanged for it.</p>
                            <p>June 22 has been selected as "Kansas day" and on that occasion the people from the Sunflower state will come to the exposition in great crowds, headed by Governor Leedy, the Kansas Exposition commission and many of the state officers.  The Kansas building on the bluff tract will be formally dedicated on that day and an elaborate program will be provided.</p>
                            <p>The regular weekly rehearsal of the Exposition chorus will be held in the Auditorium Tuesday night and members of the chorus will be admitted to the grounds at the gate at the southeast corner of the main court.  The rehearsal is set for 7:30 p. m., and Conductor Kelly will be on hand at that time to pass members of the chorus through the gate.</p>
                            <p>The resolution providing for an appropriation of $6,000 and a delegation to officially represent the commonwealth at the exposition which has been pending in the Massachusetts legislature for some time has passed both houses.  The resolution provides that the delegation shall include the governor and a number of the state officers and several members of the legislature, the appropriation being for the expenses of the trip.</p>

                            <p>Within the next twenty-four hours the Transmississippi and International Exposition will have been thrown open, and all the world invited to come and see the great and varied resources of the great west.  The culmination of the work of the last eighteen months will have been reached, and all will be ready for inspection.  With the closing hours of preparation there has been no relaxation of the efforts and the thousands of exhibitors have been straining every nerve to come under the wire ahead of the others.</p>
                            <p>The time until the hour of opening will be spent by the forces under the Exhibits department in going carefully over the different buildings and remedying any small defects that may be apparent and giving the finishing touches to the whole.  That all will be ready for the opening there is no longer any doubt.  Since the grounds were closed to visitors the exhibits have been coming in rapidly and many additional men have been employed in arranging the displays.</p>
                            <p>The grounds have been brushed up and the debris incident to the work has been removed.  The walks all about the grounds have been carefully gone over and the rough spots caused by the passage of teams have been removed.  The trees and flowers have been touched up and little remains to be done to complete the entire grounds.</p>
                            <p>On the Midway the concessionaires have been putting forth every effort to complete their preparations before the opening day and none will be behind time.  A number of them will celebrate the end of their preparations by giving a formal opening tonight.  Cards have been issued for these openings and the Midway will be in full blast from the going down of tonight's sun until the curtain is rung down on the exposition the morning of November 1.</p>
                            <p>The Government building will be thrown open tonight, the exposition officials, representatives of Nebraska and other states and prominent citizens having been invited to attend and inspect the magnificent display which has been arranged by the various departments.</p>

                            <p>Immediately following the formal exercises, the invited guests will be entertained at a luncheon in the south cafe at the east end of the main viaduct.  The luncheon will be informal, and will be followed by five-minute talks by four or five guests.  These ceremonies will occupy the time until 4 o'clock, when a public reception will be held in the Government building at the opposite end of the main court.</p>
                            <p>During the luncheon the Marine band will give its first concert in the handsome band stand on the east side of the grand plaza on the bluff tract.  The concert will commence at 2 o'clock and will continue about an hour and a half.  The entire band has arrived in the city and will be prepared to take part in the exercises.</p>
                            <p>In the evening a concert will be given in the Auditorium by the Theodore Thomas Chicago orchestra and the Omaha Exposition chorus.  The concert will commence at 8 o'clock and will last one hour.  Director Arthur Mees is in the city and the members of the orchestra will arrive tomorrow morning.</p>
                            <p>At 9 o'clock there will be a grand free display of fireworks on the north tract, directly east of the Transportation and Agricultural Implement building.</p>
                            <p>Orders having been given by the exposition management that not a nail is to be driven nor an exhibit placed tomorrow are causing no little amount of hustle, which will be carried through today and all of tonight.  The opening day will find the buildings ready to receive visitors.</p>

                            <p>The cyclorama on the West Midway was thrown open to the public last night for the first time and a large number of people enjoyed the first look at the beautiful picture which depicts battle in modern naval warfare.</p>
                            <p>The Transportation department has made arrangements for a special train for bringing the University cadets from Lincoln to Omaha on the opening day of the exposition.  The train will leave Lincoln at 7 a. m., via the Burlington, and will reach Omaha at 8:30 a. m.  The cadets will be returned to</p>

                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition has gone into the courts and has secured a temporary order to prevent the Macks, Henry, Martha and Nellie from tearing down the fence around the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>When the exposition people located the grounds, the city passed an ordinance, closing that portion of Twentieth, extending from Pinckney street to Manderson.  The defendants reside and own property along Twentieth street, between the main court and the north Midway.  A high board fence has been erected in front of their premises.  To this they object and a number of times they have torn it down.  The last time was Sunday night.  The exposition people have tired of rebuilding this fence and have gone into court to secure a preventive.  The case will be heard on its merits before Judge Fawcett on June 15, and in the meantime the temporary order will be in force.</p>

                            <p>The legal fight between the proprietors of the Streets of Cairo and the Streets of All Nations is still on before Judge Scott, with a strong possibility that it will not be concluded prior to the opening of the exposition.  As yet the respective sides have not reached the point of introducing testimony, although contracts, pictures and books descriptive of Egypt, have been exhibited to the court for inspection.  <choice><sic>Thetrouble</sic><corr>The trouble</corr></choice> grows out of the fact that both concessionaires at the exposition have contracts that allow them to exhibit camels and dances typical of life in Egypt.</p>
                            <p>The first contract entered into by the exposition with the litigants was with the Streets of Cairo people, and now they are in court contending that the subsequent contract with the Streets of All Nations is an infringement of their rights and privileges, which they allege are exclusive.</p>
