<p>Chas. F. Manderson, Chairman</p>
       
<p>Committee of Revision and Approval</p>
            
<p>Omaha, Nebr.</p>
<p>My Dear Sir:</p>

<p>You will remember that in June, 1902, the Board of Directors of the
Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition, placed upon the writer the duty
of collecting and compiling a story of that enterprise, upon completion of
which he was to deliver same to the Committee of which you are Chairman, for
their revision and approval, and upon receiving same it was found to be filed
in the Omaha Public Library as a record.</p> 

<p>Pursuant to this instruction I hand you herewith the result of my labors in
this direction, and I trust that after your Committee has given full
consideration and careful attention to the subject matter, that it may in the
main, at least, receive your approval.  The relation of the story, is I think,
complete, except that a chapter on "Architecture of the Exposition" which Mr.
Thomas R. Kimball kindly consented to write, has not as yet been received.  Mr.
Kimball now assures me that it will shortly be forthcoming, and I hope to be
able soon to send you same for insertion in its proper place in the story
herewith transmitted to you.</p> 

<p>It is sincerely hoped that a way be found through which the publication of
this history may be secured.  If published it should of necessity be very
profusely illustrated, because in this case pictures may tell the story better
than the written relation.</p> 

<p>If arrangements can be made for publication, all the illustrations needed
can be readily secured, as photographs and pictures are available when needed
for such purpose.</p> 

<p>Should you or the Committee desire to communicate with me at any time
relative to this subject, please address me in care of Concessions, Louisiana
Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Mo.</p> 
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>John Wakefield</p>                                       
<p>Secretary</p>

Montgomery and Edward Rosewater, and which statement has been revised and
approved by them.  The Certificate of said Revision and approval follows: this

been prevalent throughout theGreat West that a Comprehensive Exposition, held
at some central point, would be of incalculable and lasting benefit to every
state, territory and interest within the Trans-Mississippi Country.California
held its Mid-Winter Exposition,- a state enterprise,- at San Francisco, January
to July, 1894.Kansas City advocated the holding at that city of a
Mid-Continent Exposition.Denver had proposed a Western States Exposition and
had secured subscriptions for a large amount, and had extended some $15,000 in
exploiting it, but feeling that the times were not propitious, had determined
to postpone and planned to hold it in 1903, celebrating the purchase of
Louisiana territory from France.Texas had planned to hold a Western and
Southern Stages Exposition at Galveston, celebrating particularly the opening
of deep water transportation from Gulf points.Minneapolis and St. Paul
advocated a Northwestern States Exposition for the twin cities.</p> 

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Congress (see foot note) meeting in St. Louis, Mo.
in November, 1894, was persuaded, through the efforts of the Nebraska
delegation, headed by Robt. W. Richardson, Judge L.H. Bradley of Omaha and Hon.
W.J. Bryan of Lincoln, and on the invitation of the then mayor of Omaha. Hon.
George P. Bemis, to hold its ensuing session of said Congress at Omaha in
November, 1895.</p> 

<p>The pledges made to secure this Congress involved assuming the expenses of
the meeting (about $3,000.00) and a conference on the subject was held with the
then mayor, Hon. George P. Bemis.Mr. R.W. Richardson suggested the sending of
invitations to a meeting to arrange for securing the needed sum, and further
suggested that, as a general feeling existed favoring a great Exposition
somewhere in the Trans-Mississippi country, Omaha, entertaining the
Trans-Mississippi Congress, might reasonably hope to have such an Exposition
officially sanctioned by the Congress, locating it at Omaha.The suggestion
was accepted and the mayor requested Mr. Richardson to prepare the letter of
the invitation, which he did.(This was not the origin of the Exposition idea,
which was in the general desire for one, but it was the origin of the
successful purpose to secure the official approval of the Exposition by the
Trans-Mississippi Congress and its location at Omaha)Mayor Bemis issued the
call, the meeting was held, a Committee as appointed with Mr. Isaac Carpenter
as Chairman, who with the able and earnest assistance of Judge L.H. Bradley,
Mr. A.L. Fields, and others soon secured and made available the desired amount.</p>

<p>At the Omaha meeting of said Congress, held November 25, 26, 27, and 28,
1895, resolutions prepared under instructions of the Nebraska delegation, by a
Committee of five, viz:Orville C. Holmes, Chairman, Prof. Wm. Rees, James
Walsh, Jas. C. Dahlman and Dudley Smith were presented for consideration on
Nov. 27th by the Hon. William J. Bryan, who had just been elected as President
of said Congress, as follows:(quoting from official proceedings of the
Congress).</p> 

<p>"At the unanimous request of the Delegation of Nebraska I ask consent to
offer the following resolution at this time. It won't take but a few minutes of
time, and I believe we have five minutes in which to present it.This
resolution, while it immediately concerns the city of Omaha, concerns also, in
a general way all of this Trans-Mississippi country.Those of you who attended
the World's Fair know you met people who have never been West.I have met a
number of people who have never been West, and they told me that they thought
Chicago was "West".There is now being held in Atlanta what is know as the
Atlanta Exposition, and people are going there and seeing that country who have
never visited that country before, and who would not have been there but for
this Exposition.It is not only necessary that the merchant shall have good
wares on his shelves, but it is also necessary that the people who want to buy,
shall know that he has the wares there.People who live in the East do not
know the West.Any person who travels from the West to the East will be
astonished by ignorance he finds there in regard to our Western country.They
have no idea of our resources, and we believe an Exposition here will bring the
people from the East and other parts of the World, and it will be of a great
and lasting benefit to the whole Western country.It was said by one man down
east, that under certain conditions the West would do all of the manufacturing
for the country.It does furnish productions that are not know down in the
East.We believe that an Exposition here will draw people here that will be of
great value to all of the citizens.The only difference of opinion would be as
to the particular place for holding this Exposition.There are other great
cities that would like to have it; Saint Paul, Minneapolis, Denver, Kansas
City.We believe that Omaha would be the best place.All of the northern part
of the country can find its way here on direct lines.We believe this City is
the proper place for this Exposition and therefore we state it in the
resolution.All we ask is to have a vote upon this resolution, and we would
like to have all votes in favor of a Western Exposition, and to locate it at
this place.If the people here think this is the best place, we ask you to
vote for this in this resolution.I ask the unanimous consent that this
resolution be placed upon its final passage at this time.</p> 

<p>"Whereas, We believe that an Exposition of all the products, industries
and civilization of the States west of the Mississippi River, made at some
central gateway where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these
great wealth-producing States, would be of great value, not only to the
Trans-Mississippi States, but to all the home-seekers in the world;therefore,</p>

<p>Resolved, That the United States Congress be requested to take such steps
as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha during the
months of August, September, and October in the year 1898, and that the
representatives of such States and Territories in Congress be requested to
favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in carrying out
this enterprise."(Applause.)</p>

<p>Member from Minnesota:I might say on behalf of the State of Minnesota
that there is a movement on foot to have a North-Western Exposition to be held
in Minneapolis upon which work has already commenced.I think there should be
two of these; Atlanta for the South west, and I think Nebraska would be a good
place for the North-west.There can be arrangements made whereby there will be
no friction.</p>

<p>Hon. John Doniphan (of St. Joseph, Missouri):I rise with the desire to
second the resolution of the President of this Congress and to ask that I may
be permitted to give the explanation of why I think it should be held here.I
desire to say to the Convention, that I don't think a more appropriate place
than the City of Omaha could be selected at which to have an Exposition of the
wealth, of the growth and the products of this Trans-Mississippi country.</p>

<p>It would be an Exposition that would be united in bringing people from all
parts of the world-the United States at least.It is nearly central as to
point of location.As has been well said, the people East of us know but
little of the capacity and nothing of the possibilities of this great
Trans-Mississippi country.Indeed the City of Omaha is the best example that
could possibly be made of what can be done.Ninety years ago, if you
recollect, the first civilized expedition was made up this river by Lewis and
Clarke.In the city where we now stand the first treaty was made with the
savage men of the West.This country then was an unknown wilderness.We find
now, what?Fourteen States and another soon to be admitted.(Applause from
the New Mexico delegation).We find nearly twenty million people occupying it. 
We find that the wealth of the country has been added-at least one-third of the
wealth of the country has been added since the census of 1850, on this side of
the Mississippi River.This City of Omaha is one of the grandest inland cities
of the whole United States.Therefore, I hope we will not divide in reference
to two or three cities, but that we will be united on a central point in trying
to have one Exposition and have it at the City of Omaha, the gateway, as it
were, of the West.(Applause).If we could throw the reins to imagination and
think what the next half a century will do with this country; if we could go to
sleep and wake up fifty years hence, we would see the mighty wealth which would
be developed far beyond we could conceive of.I could imagine that, at that
time, Omaha would be as great as New York-greater perhaps than New York or
Chicago or any other city that exists on this continent, because of the wealth
in these mountains and the great wealth in these valleys.(Applause).</p> 

<p>Mr. H.R. Whitmore (of St. Louis, Mo.):I do not wish to be considered
conceited when I say there is no one on this floor that realizes more fully
than I do what it means for any city to undertake to entertain a Convention
like this.We are indebted to Omaha for the invitation; we accepted the
invitation and we are here.The people of Omaha have labored for weeks in
preparing for this Congress and making arrangements for our entertainment while
we are here, and I don't think these people would ask anything from this
Congress which we would not willingly grant, and I think in no better way can
we show our appreciation of their courtesy and generosity than by the unanimous
passage of this resolution.</p> 

<p>Hon. Geo. Q. Cannon (of Salt Lake City, Utah):I rise to second the
proposition of an Exposition, and to have it held in Omaha.I thoroughly agree
with all of the remarks that have been made concerning the hospitality of this
city, as being a suitable place for this Exposition.Standing as it does as
the gateway of the Great West it seems to me that it will attract more people
now and in 1897-8 than any other spot that might be selected.I have had great
interest in Nebraska and especially in the City of Omaha.It was my pleasure
to roam over these hills fifty years ago this coming summer.I spent the
summer of '46 in the hills around Omaha, and the winter of 1846-7 I spent six
months above here on the river.Of course this was all Indian territory.The
Omahans roamed over this country undisturbed.I have taken great interest, in
consequence of these early associations, in Omaha and its growth,I confess
that I felt very great surprise, and I might say I was amazed when I was taken
around by the Mayor and proprietor of the Bee, to see the structures that have
been erected, especially the city hall.I have never seen a building that
attracted me more than your city hall here.The council chamber I think is a
marvel of beauty, more beautiful than the Senate of the United States.I went
through the Bee office and I was astounded at it.I went through it with a
feeling of amazement to think that such a structure was erected in this town,
where my recollection of its early days are so vivid.I could not help but
compliment the Mayor and Mr. Rosewater on the wonderful structures that have
been erected.I have not had much opportunity to look through the town, but
what I have seen so impresses me with enterprise of the citizens who have built
up such a grand city on the banks of the mighty Missouri River.Therefore, in
view of all my feelings in regard to these matters, I most heartily second that
resolution, that we shall have an Exposition of the Trans-Mississippi products,
manufactures, etc., and that the Exposition be held in Omaha. (Applause).</p> 

<p>Mr. Howell Jones (of Topeka, Kansas):I rise to state that at the
conference of the deep water convention held at Topeka, Kas., on the first day
of October, 1895, a permanent committee of five from all the States and
Territories west of the Mississippi River was selected and that committee was
clothed with power to hold an Inter-American Congress or Inter-American
Exposition anywhere in the West and the intention is to call an Inter-American
Exposition to be held on the Gulf of Mexico in 1897, exhibiting everything that
it is possible to exhibit and it was their intention to invite the American
people to make an exhibit of what products and manufactures they have to
exchange, and therefore I think it is my duty to explain to these people here
what the people on the Gulf of Mexico intend to do in 1897 so that you can look
forward to getting a great deal of information and products for your Exposition
in 1897.</p> 

<p>A Delegate(from Arizona):I do not care to make a talk, but I rise to
present an explanation.One of these gentlemen, I won't say which one,
insisted that I should make a speech in favor of this Exposition in 1898.I
decline to make a speech on a question on which there is absolutely no
difference of opinion.</p> 

<p>The resolution was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>And thus it was!</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Congress is composed of the leading and
representative men of all classes, professions, and business interests of the
states and territories lying west of the Mississippi River, who assemble at
stated periods to discuss measures for promoting the Commercial and material
welfare of the region they represent, and recommend such measures as their
judgment dictates to the National Government, the states and the people for
adoption.It is representative in its capacity, its membership being secured
through operations of Section Six (6) of its plan of organization, reading as
follows:</p> 

<p>"Six.The basis of representation shall be as follows:</p> 

<p>The Governor of any state or territory may appoint the delegates; the
Mayor of each city one delegate, and additional delegate for each five thousand
inhabitants; provided, however, that no City shall have more than ten
delegates; each County may appoint one delegate through its Executive officer;
every business organization one delegate, and an additional delegate from every
fifty members, provided, however, that no such organization shall be entitled
to more than ten delegates."</p> 

<p>It is advisory in character, and its discussions are mainly on any
subject, national or local, bearing upon the welfare of its constituency.This
region embraces nineteen states and five territories, or more briefly,
twenty-four states and territories, and embraces two thirds of the area, one
third of the population, and one half the wealth of this great republic.</p>

<p>EXPLOITATION</p>

<p>The holding of an Exposition having been favored by many citizens of
Omaha, officially sanctioned by the Trans-Mississippi Congress, and having been
duly organized as a Corporation under the laws of Nebraska, it now became
important to proceed in all earnestness and steadfastness to promote the
purposes of the organization to the end that the object sought should be
fulfilled to a most thorough and satisfactory conclusion.The Board of
Directors addressed their best thought and effort to this end.</p> 

<p>At the first meeting of the Board of Directors Mr. E.H. Odell representing
the manufacturers and merchants club of Council Bluffs, Ia., addressed the
Directors, assuring them of the strong interest felt in the proposed enterprise
by the people of that City, and particularly by the members of the business
association which he represented.He presented an invitation to the Directors
to attend a Banquet, in honor of the project, to be given by the Manufacturers 
and Merchants Club, at the Grand Hotel, Council Bluffs, Wednesday, January
22nd, at 8 o'clock P.M.The invitation was accepted, and at this dinner, the 
object, aims and purposes of the Corporation were discussed fully.</p> 

<p>Very neighborly feelings and sentiments were expressed and by a resolution
passed unanimously, the following named gentlemen were appointed a Committee,
representing Council Bluffs, to act in conjunction with the Board of Directors,
and aidthe enterprise in all ways possible.Committee:Mr. A.A. Hazleton,
chairman, and Messrs. Thomas Bowman, Geo. F. Wright, J.J. Steadman, W.H.M.
Pusey, M.F. Rohrer, W.W. Loomis, Thomas C. Dawson, William Moore, E.W. Hart,
and Victor E. Bender.The Iowa Legislature being then in session and being one
of the few western states whose Legislature would hold sessions that year, it
was particularly desired that Iowa should early recognize the Exposition and
provide for a state representation.The Secretary,byinvitation, met with
the Council Bluffs Committee, including state senator Pusey of Iowa, in Council
Bluffs on the evening of January 25th and went over with them the aims and
purposes of the Exposition and best manner of presenting the subject to the
Iowa Legislature to secure their commendation and early action.On January
27th the Council Bluffs Committee dines with the Board of Directors at
Commercial Club Rooms and a joint Committee was selected to go to Des Moines,
Ia., to interest the Legislature and the Newspapers in the project and exploit
it as fully as possible.This Committee consisting of President G.W. Wattles,
Secretary John A. Wakefield, Ex-Gov. Alvin Saunders, Judge W.S. Strawn, Mr.
Z.T. Lindsey of Omaha, and Messrs. E.H. Odell, Chas. R. Hannan, I.L.M. Treynor,
W.G. Moore and Thos. C. Dawson of Council Bluffs, went to Des Moines on
February 10th and spent two days in Iowa's capitol City, meeting Committees of
both houses of the Legislature, who treated the subject and the delegation
kindly and both branches of the Legislature passed unanimously.The following
resolutions:</p>

<p>WHEREAS:Delegates representing the twenty-four states and territories
lying west of the Mississippi River, at the Trans-Mississippi Congress of 1895,
adopted a Resolution providing for the holding of an Exposition for the purpose
of exhibiting the products, manufactures, arts and industries of these states
and territories; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS:The said Convention voted to hold said Exposition at the City of
Omaha in the year 1898, and</p> 

<p>WHEREAS, The Common interest of the states and territories constituting
this greatregion as well as the country at large, will be greatly prompted
thereby, and the interest of the state of Iowa, lying at its gateway, will be
especially benefited by such an exposition on her borders; therefore, be it.</p> 

<p>RESOLVED, By the General Assembly of the State of Iowa, That the holding
of said Trans-Mississippi Exposition is hereby heartily approved, and that the
Senators and Representatives from our sister state, Nebraska, and the other
Trans-Mississippi states in procuring the passage at this session of congress,
of a bill giving national recognition top said exposition, and providing for an
appropriation for a National Exhibit and the necessary and proper buildings to
contain the same; and be it further</p> 

<p>RESOLVED; That a copy of these resolutions be certified by the Secretary of State
under the seal of the state and sent to the Senators and Representatives in
Congress from Iowa.</p>

<p>This was the initial state Legislation in aid of the Exposition. 
Meanwhile, United States Senator William V. Allan of Nebraska had introduced in
the National Senate, January 3rd, 1896, Senate bill #1306, recognizing and
approving the holding of the Exposition and providing an appropriation of Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000) for a Government building.The bill was read twice
and referred to the Committee on International Expositions of which Committee,
United States Senator John M. Thurston of Nebraska was Chairman.</p> 

<p>Hon. David H. Mercer representative in Congress for the second district of
Nebraska including Omaha, had introduced in Congress a bill in aid of the
Exposition H.R. 6193, similar in terms to Senate bill #1306, but providing for
anappropriation of $500,000.00 to coverexpense of the Governments
participation therein.The bill had been favorably received and Mr. Mercer was
confident that its passage in the House of Congress could be executed, but a
controversy as to amount could only result in lessening the appropriationto
the smaller stated sum.</p> 

<p>A meeting of the Directors and others with Senator John M. Thurston, was
held at Commercial Club Rooms on February 19th, 1896, at which meeting Senator
W.V. Allan's bill and its probabilities for passage was considered, and the
Senator expressed his belief that passage of the bill could be secured of
actions as he advised be taken.It was agreed that an appropriation of funds
and the sum thereof be subject of later efforts, was left to the judgment and
action of the Congressional delegation of this district.Copy of bill amended
to provide for $200,000 appropriation, and further amended in other and minor
particulars and as passed by Congress, will be found on page_____.</p> 

<p>The Board of Directors on January 31st declared its present object was to
secure, First:formal resolutions of approval and endorsement from Congress,
states, cities, organizations and individuals. Second:, and later;
Appropriations of adequate amounts to properly and fittingly represent the
resources, products and capabilities of each of the Trans-Mississippi States,
the National Government and such other states as could be sufficiently
interested.</p> 

<p>A Press Bureau was created and Messrs. Isaac W. Carpenter, C.S. Montgomery
and John A. Wakefield placed in charge thereof/their duty being to have charge
of matter and correspondence in relation to the newspapers of the country, etc. 
Circular letters were prepared and sent to Boards of Trade,Commercial
organizations, Governors and Mayors of Cities, etc., asking both approval and
the forwarding of Resolutions favoring the project to their various
representatives in the National Congress, strong letters of prominent men and
well knownnewspapers were printed on postal cards, and each day for some
weeks.Such postals were sent to each of the U.S. Senators, Representatives,
the President and the Cabinet officers.Efforts of this and kindred kind were
put forth with indefatigable energy and in almost unlimited quantity, and the
success which finally came to the enterprise in such large degree, is
attributable in large part to the interest aroused and results secured from
these early and well directed efforts to secure approval of and participation
in the project.</p> 

<p>The Legislature of Utah held a session in winter of 1895-6 and it was early
decided that good results would follow the sending of a delegation of Omahans
to visit them and more fully present the Exposition aims to their notice. 
Accordingly on Friday, March 20th, 1896, a delegation consisting of President,
G.W. Wattles, Secretary John A. Wakefield, Hon. Gilbert M. Hitchcock, Capt.
H.E. Palmer, Z.T. Lindsey, A.S. Hazleton of Council Bluffs, and Directors W.R.
Bennett, Charles Metz, J.H. Evans, H.A. Thompson, left Omaha in the Pullman
Car, Montana, kindly donated for the trip by the Pullman Company, the
transportation being generously donated by the Union Pacific Company; the
delegation providing personally for all the other expenses of the trip. 
Saturday was spent in Cheyenne, Wyoming.Meetings were held with Governor W.A.
Richards, the state officials, and prominent citizens, and newspaper men, and
were cordially received and much enthusiasm in the project was aroused.On
Monday following the delegation met Governor H.M. Wells and Joint Committee of
the Utah Legislature then in session were most kindly received, and Utah's
participation was pledged, both branches of the Legislature unanimously passing
Resolutions as follows:</p>

<p>"Resolved, By the Senate and House of Representatives of the state of
Utah, that the holding of said Trans-Mississippi exposition is heartily
approved, and that the people of Utah are urged to cooperate with the people of
the other states of the trans-mississippi region, and to take this opportunity
of making a fitting display of their resources, and be it further</p>

<p>Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the senators and
representatives from Utah in the national congress by the secretary of state,
with the request that they promote as far as possible the said exposition."
Thus Utah was the second state to officially recognize and commend the
Exposition by Legislative act.On Tuesday the delegation dined with the mayor
and city officials of the city of Ogden, Utah, and Ogden's best efforts and
aids were promised.Wednesday and Thursday found the delegation in Denver,
Colo., where many meetings were held, first with Gov. A. W. McIntyre and the
state officials, then with Mayor McMurray and city Officials, President Henry
P. Steele and members of the chamber of Commerce, the Denver Mining Exchange,
etc., At each of these meetings great interest was shown and approval of the
project, with promise of Colorado's best representation was given.The
delegation reached Omaha Saturday eve, March 28th, feeling that they had done
good work for the Exposition and that good results would follow.At each place
visited the Newspapers treated the delegation most kindly and published
elaborate and full information of the object in view, and to them much of the
success resulting from this Exposition trip was due.On return of the
delegation the Directors ordered that a telegram be sent to Hon. D.H. Mercer,
our member of Congress embodying a succint statement of situation and results
accomplished to date.Telegram was as follows:</p>

<p>"March 31st, 1896</p>

<p>To Hon. H. Mercer,</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Governors and leading State Officials of Iowa, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, South
Dakota, Missouri, California, Arizona, and Nebraska, have all pledged State
appropriations, and other will follow as soon as your Bill becomes a law. 
Legislatures do not meet until next Winter except Iowa and Utah.They had
passed Joint Resolutions and formally promised appropriations as soon as
Government recognition and appropriation passes.</p>

<p>G.W. Wattles, Pres.</p>
<p>John A. Wakefield, Sec'y."</p>

<p>Regarding further subscriptions to the capital stock.The matter was
fully considered by the Directors and at meeting on February 21st, 1896, it was
ordered no further soliciting be done, and any outstanding lists be called in -
the total subscriptions amounted at this time to $_____________ upon which a
call of Five (5) per cent had been ordered on January 24th, 1896, and a second
assessment of Five (5) per cent was ordered on April 17, 1896.The reason for
above action was the belief that unless the National Government recognized,
approved and arranged for its participation in the Exposition, it would be
inadvisable to further proceed in the matter.If Government passed the bill
now before it, then a justifiable basis would exist for further work and
efforts.Otherwise, the project would be abandoned.The effects of the
financial panic of 1893, followed throughout the west by successive crop
failures in 1894 and 1895 resulting from drought, had made business conditions
the worst possible and it required strong resolution and supreme faith to
anticipate best financial results for the Exposition, under the then present
circumstances and conditions, even with the aid and support of the Government.
Every effort was henceforth directed toward forwarding the passage of the
Exposition bill by Congress.Reports from Washington were conflicting; it
seemed to be a comparatively easy matter to get a bill through the Senate but
opposition sprung up in the House and our reports were sometimes sanguine, then
disheartening, sometimes encouraging, causing belief in final success to
obtain, then doleful causing hopes to fall to low ebb.Mr. Mercer never seemed
to lose confidence in being able to finally secure the passage of the bill -
and the hopes of the Directors were largely dependent upon the sanguine
confidence of our Congressman, and faith in the belief that "If any one kin, He
kin."</p>

<p>April 10th, 1896, the following telegram was received from Hon. Geo. F.
Wright, Vice President for Iowa, for the Exposition, who had spent much time at
Des Moines, working for Exposition recognition.</p>

<p>"Des Moines, Iowa, April 10th, 11:50 a.m. Trans-Mississippi Exposition,
Omaha.</p>

<p>Both houses Iowa Legislature passed unanimously.Appropriation of $10,000
for preliminary expenses Trans-Mississippi Exposition and promise any
additional amount necessary for Iowa's exhibit, at next session."The fact of
this action was at once wired to Senator W. V. Allan and representative D. H.
Mercer at Washington.Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Thos. B.
Reed was opposed to the bill arguing economy, that Government was even then
borrowing money to conduct its affairs.</p>

<p>Representative Dingley, while not strongly opposing it, thought that
properly a provision should be attached requiring the Exposition to raise the
sum of $500,000 before the National act should become operative.The Directors
considered this proposal and decided that this was, perhaps, a good proviso,
for if Government passed the bill, it would certainly be necessary to raise
such an amount to permit a successful exposition and the fact that the
Government act required it, might help in the securing of it.As a result the
Directors ordered that Senators Allan Thurston and Representative Mercer be
advised that they favored the idea, but that the amount should not properly be
for a sum, much, if any, greater than the Government's appropriation.It was
finally agreed that the amount to be placed in the bill for Government
appropriation be the sum of $250,000.00 and that Exposition be required to
secure bona fide subscriptions of undoubted character, in the sum of
$250,000.00 before the Government act should become operative.</p>

<p>April 10th, 1896.On receipt of telegram advising of Iowa's action, Senators
Allan and Thurston decided to push Mr. Allan's Senate Bill #1306 as it was
becoming clear that favorable action by the Ways and Means Committee of the
House on Mr. Mercer's bill #6143, could not be depended upon, as being obtained
early enough to secure passage at that session of Congress, which was most
important.They had the bill called up, and after amending it, on demand of
Senator Allison to carry $200,000.00 in place of $250,000.00 as the bill read,
it was passed by the Senate that day.Mr. Allison stated that the
appropriation for Atlanta, Ga., was for but $200,000.00, and he thought that
sum would be sufficient for and satisfactory to Omaha.The bill now went to
the House, and Mr. Mercer discovered that he had the fight of his life on hand
to secure passage.On the request of the Directors, Mr. President Wattles went
to Washington to endeavor to assist as he might in passage of the bill.On
April 30, 1896, the Ways &amp; Means Committee of the House made a favorable report
on the Exposition bill, tacking on the requirement that Exposition secure
$250,000.00 subscriptions, that requirement not being attached to the bill
passed by the Senate.</p>

<p>President Wattles having returned from Washington and the Directors
feeling again the need of a special representative there, that Mr. Mercer could
be aided in any additional way possible, the Directors requested Ex-Senator
Chas. F. Manderson and Hon. Edward Rosewater to go to Washington.Mr.
Rosewater started at once on May 7th, 1896; Mr. Manderson was unable to leave
the city at the time.Opportunity for passage of bill by congress was now felt
to be assured, but vexations obstacles prevented and annoying delays ensued,
and as the session was fast drawing toward its close, the fear of non success
was strong, and great anxiety was felt over the situation.It was expected
that the bill would be called up for passage early in May, and again at several
later dates in May.It was assured that recognition of Speaker Reed would be
secured permitting the placing of the bill before the House for passage,but
all of no avail; one obstacle after another intervened, and the anxiety grew
greater, notwithstanding the able assistance of Senators Allison and Gear of
Iowa, Senators Allan and Thurston of Nebraska, of practically the whole Iowa
and Nebraska delegations and their friends, the situation could not be
improved, nor the desired opportunity secured.A demand upon the speaker for a
set day met with no response.It was only watch and wait.</p>

<p>On June 5th Mr. Mercer found his opportunity.The request for consent to
place the bill on its passage was made, when lo! objection was made, and by
whom? by one Omar M. Kem, sent to the House of Congress to represent the wishes
and desires of the Sixth (6th) Congressional district of Nebraska.Yet who in
this case frightfully misrepresented them, as the rain of denunciatory
telegrams from his district fully demonstrated to him, but stubborn to the last
he kept up his opposition and aided not in passing the bill.</p>

<p>On June 9th at 6:30 p.m., Mr. Mercer again secured recognition by the
speaker, but again he was doomed to disappointment, for Mr. Bailey of Texas
objected, as he said from conscientious motives, to unanimous consent to
consider the bill.It now looked like sure defeat as Congress was scheduled to
adjourn the following day.But on June 10th recognition was again secured, and
Mr. Kem having left for home, and Mr. Bailey being absent at lunch unanimous
consent was secured, the bill passed, hurried over to the Senate, which body
Senator Allan had held in session purposely, the amended bill was passed by the
Senate, was finally engrossed, taken at once by Mr. Mercer to the President,
Hon. Grover Cleveland and at once signed, and thus became a law after one of
the most memorable struggles in Congress.</p>

<p>Speaker Thos. B. Reed stated that no bill that he knew of had been so well
exploited as was this one; that the bombardment of Congress was not only
courteous and of good and convincing argument but that it had been continuous,
never letting up from the early beginning to the final passage of the bill and
signing it by the President.Be it also, yet without the untiring,
indefatigable, indomitable, yet urbane and polite efforts of Hon. David H.
Mercer, aided and assisted though he was by many others, the Congressional bill
would not have passed and there would not have been an Exposition to need and
deserve a history.</p>

<p>The news of the passage of Congressional bill released the tension of
anxiety, and cheerfulness and confidence in ultimate success prevailed
generally.On June 13th, 1896, Council Bluffs had a great celebration parade
with music, fireworks and speeches and good cheer was on every hand.</p>

<p>The Commercial Club of Omaha took up and arranged for a grand civic
demonstration in honor of the passage of the bill and in honor of the men who
secured its passage, this was planned to and did take place on the evening of
Friday, June 26th, 1896.A procession several miles long and composed of many
military and civic organizations added to the splendor of the demonstration,
and the booming of cannon, setting off of fireworks, and the music of many
bands, supplied the embellishments of a great occasion.It seemed indeed that
everybody was there, and the route of the procession and Jefferson Square,
where the speaking occurred were packed with those who came to see and cheer.</p>

<p>The parade was under the direction of Grand Marshal Robt. S. Wilcox, and
starting at 8:15 p.m., disbanded at Jefferson Square shortly after 9:00
o'clock, and the speaking of the evening began at once.</p>

<p>On request of Chas. F. Weller, President of the Commercial Club, President
G. W. Wattles of the Exposition presided.With a few complimentary words he
introduced Nebraska's Governor, Hon. Silas A. Holcomb, who was greeted with
applause and spoke briefly in congratulation.He was followed by Hon. David H.
Mercer, who was greeted by loud and long applause, really an ovation.He
complimented the management of the Board of Directors and those who so ably
assisted them and in conclusion presented President Wattles with the pen with
which President Cleveland signed the Exposition bill.</p>

<p>Senator W. V. Allan was cheered vigorously and continuously for some
minutes when next introduced.His speech was felicitous and complimentary to
Omaha and its enterprise.Letters and telegrams of regret were read from Gov.
W. A. Richards of Wyoming, Gov. A. W. McIntyre of Colorado, Gov. C. H. Sheldon
of South Dakota, U.S. Senators W. B. Allison and John H. Gear of Iowa, John M.
Thurston of Nebraska, Congressman W. E. Andrews, E. J. Hainer and O. H. Kem of
Nebraska, D. B. Henderson, Thos. Updegraff, Geo. D. Perkins, Robt. G. Cousins,
S. M. Clark, John C. Lacey, J. P. Dollivar, Geo, M. Curtis of Iowa,
Ex-Congressman W. J. Bryan of Nebraska, Hon. C. F. Joy of Mo., and others.</p>

<p>Ex-Gov. Robt. W. Furnas of Brownville, Nebraska was introduced as a man
who had been working on Exposition in Nebraska for a half century past.He
responded in his usual happy manner, and was followed by Hon. John N. Baldwin
of Council Bluffs, Iowa, who delivered the oration of the evening, an eloquent
address, thoroughly western in spirit and it was received with great
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Chas. F. Manderson spoke next; he grew reminiscent and compared
the parade of a mere handful of people in 1869 celebrating the completion of
the Union Pacific Railway with the parade of the present occasion.He
addressed complimentary remarks to those who had been instrumental in passing
the bill.He was especially complimentary to President Wattles whom he styled
the "inspiriting soul of the enterprise, a man endowed with energy, character,
and all the elements of true manhood."</p>

<p>J. H. Van Dusen of South Omaha followed.Mr. Wattles gave assurance of
South Omaha's great interest and its fullest support to the Exposition.Hon.
John Doniphan, Vice President for Missouri, was the next speaker.He Spoke
briefly, being reminded of the fact that ninety two years ago on the site of
Council Bluffs, Ia., a treaty was drawn, treating with the Indians with
reference to the land acquired by the Louisiana Purchase.This being the last
speech, the audience adjourned with a rousing three cheers and a tiger for the
Exposition and its promoters at home and in Congress.</p>

<p>Now that the great object sought, national recognition, approval and
participation, had been pledged and the enthusiasm following this success had
settled to strong resolve to go forward to ultimate success, it was determined
by the management that the scope of the work should be broadened and the
business men of the city be called upon to lend their best efforts in the work
and particularly toward securing the stick subscriptions required by Congress.</p>

<p>A meeting of merchants and citizens was called at the Commercial Club
rooms on the evening of June 18th, 1896, and the rooms were packed with
representative citizens and the utmost enthusiasm prevailed, many speeches were
made - all favorable.The result of the meeting was the adoption by unanimous
vote, amid great cheering of the following:"Resolved, that it is the sense of
this meeting that the Directors of the Exposition proceed with the work
outlined, at their discretion, and that we pledge to them the hearty support of
the business men and capitalists of the city."</p>

<p>The Board of Directors met on June 19th, 1896, and it was decided to call
a meeting on July 20th, by invitation, of citizens to serve as a Bureau of
Finance for the Exposition.The meeting was held, and after full
consideration adopted, as its action, the following, "Resolved:That this
meeting recommends that the sum of $500,000.00 be raised by stock
subscriptions, and that the following named persons, viz:</p>

<p>H. Kountz,H. W. Yates,Guy C. Barton</p>
<p>J. H. MillardV. B. Caldwell,Frank Colpetzer</p>

<p>Alvin Saunders Lucius WellsHarold McCormick</p>
<p>David Anderson</p>

<p>be appointed as a permanent Finance Committee to secure subscriptions of stocks
and have charge of the collection and disbursement of all funds and have
general financial management of the Exposition."
It was further ordered that this Committee prepare a report and present same to
a citizens meeting to be held on June 22nd, 1896.</p>

<p>On that date this Committee reported to the large meeting of citizens as
follows:</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman:</p>

<p>Your Committee appointed to examine into the Articles of Incorporation of the
Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition, and to recommend such changes as
might be deemed conducive to the popularizing and success of the Exposition,
report as follows:</p>

<p>We recommend that Article IV of Articles of Incorporation be amended to make
the par value of each share of capital stock $5.00 in place of $10.00</p>

<p>We recommend that Article VII of the Articles of Incorporation be amended to
read as follows:</p>

<p>"The affairs of this Corporation shall be conducted by a Board of not less than
fifty Directors, to be elected from among the stock-holders and
stock-subscribers of this Corporation, at a special stock-holders' meeting to
be called immediately when shares of stock aggregating the par value of $50,000
shall have been subscribed.Such Board of Directors shall elect a President,
Vice President, a Treasurer and a Secretary, the duties of which officers shall
be fixed by the Board.Such officers shall be elected from among the Directors
or other stockholders.Such Board of Directors shall also elect from its
number, an Executive Committee of not less than five or more than nine, which
said Executive Committee shall have all the powers of the Board of Directors
when said Board is not in session, and shall choose a chairman from their own
number.There shall be twenty-four additional Vice-Presidents, one for each
state and Territory west of the Mississippi River, who shall be the same
persons heretofore chosen by this Corporation as heretofore organized.The
Board of Directors shall have authority to appoint such other officers, agents,
servants, employees, committees or Boards as they may deem necessary for the
conduct of the business of the Corporation, and they may from time to time
prescribe the duties of all such appointees in such manner as they may deem
best.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors shall have authority to delegate to any subordinate
committee or Board, such duties as the Board itself might otherwise exercise. 
The Directors, when elected, shall serve during the life of this Corporation,
and shall have powers to fill vacancies in their numbers caused by death,
resignation or other reason, and may for cause expel any member of said Board."</p>

<p>We recommend that Article VIII of the Articles of Incorporation be amended by
substituting for the first sentence thereof, the following words:</p>

<p>"A stock-holders meeting of this Corporation shall be called immediately when
the aggregate sum of $50,000 par value of the capital stock of this Corporation
shall have been subscribed, at which meeting the election of Directors
hereinbefore provided for shall take place.notice of said meeting shall be
given to said stock-holders and stock-subscribers, by publication in the daily
papers of Omaha at least two days before the time fixed for holding said
meeting," and by adding to said Article the following language:</p>

<p>"At all stock-holders' meetings, any stock-holder or stock-subscriber may vote
who has made the payments on his stock-subscription called for by the Board of
Directors, and voting by proxy shall be allowed."</p>
<p>
We recommend that Article XI of the Articles of Incorporation be amended by
striking out the following words:</p>

<p>"and the stock represented at such meeting shall be considered a quorum without
regard to the amount represented," and substituting therefor the following
words:</p>

<p>"And at such meetings one quarter of the stock subscribed present and voting
shall be considered a quorum."</p>

<p>We report that of the two subscription papers containing the subscriptions of
the stock already made to this Corporation, the paper compromising the greater
number and amount of subscriptions is not in legal form and does not give the
subscribers whose names are attached thereto the status of the share-holders in
the Corporation, and we recommend that such subscriptions be re-taken in due
form and that the form of subscription employed be uniform in all cases.</p>

<p>We recommend that the changes heretofore outlined in the Articles of
Incorporation and in the form of subscriptions to stock, be required by this
Committee of Twenty-four as a condition precedent to the acceptance by this
committee of its appointment and to the work of raising further subscriptions.</p>

<p>We recommend that upon the completion of the reorganization of the Corporation,
as herein outlined, the action of the Corporation in creating the present
Bureau of Finance be rescinded to the end that the Corporation may take such
action regarding the division of the work of said Corporation as may be
desired.</p>

<p>This report was submitted to the Directors and considered by them on June 27th,
and it was ordered that a meeting of the stockholders be called to meet on
Friday, July 10th, 1896, to consider and vote upon amendments to the Articles
of Incorporation.The Directors decided to recommend to stockholders meeting
that no election of Directors should occur until the sum of $300,000.00 at
least should be subscribed, the election then to be for a full board of fifty
Directors, the present Board of Directors tendering their resignation,
effective upon such election of a new Board.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the stockholders in July 10th, 1896, 795 shares of stock
being present and voting, the Articles of Incorporation were changed by vote as
follows:</p>

<p>Article VII was amended to read as follows:</p>

<p>"The affairs of this Corporation shall be conducted by a board of not less than
fifty (50) directors, to be elected from among the stockholders and stock
subscribers of this corporation at a special meeting of stock-holders to be
called immediately when shares of stock aggregating the par value of three
hundred thousand ($300,000) Dollars shall have been subscribed.Such Board of
Directors shall elect a President, a vice-president, a treasurer and a
secretary, the duties of which officers shall be fixed by the board.Such
officers shall be elected from among the directors or other stockholders.Such
board of directors shall also elect from its number an executive committee of

twenty-four additional vice-presidents one (1) for each state and territory
west of the Mississippi river.The board of directors shall have authority to

from time to time prescribe the duties of all such appointees in such manner as
they may deem best.The board of directors shall have authority to delegate to
any subordinate Committee or board, such duties as the board itself might
otherwise exercise.</p>

<p>The directors when elected shall serve during the life of this corporation, and
shall have power to fill vacancies in their numbers caused by death,
resignation or any other reason, and may for cause expel any member of said
board by a two-thirds vote of the entire board.</p>

<p>Article VIII was amended by substituting for the first sentence thereof the
following words:</p>

<p>"A stockholders' meeting of this corporation shall be called immediately when
the aggregate sum of three hundred thousand ($300,000) dollars shall have been
subscribed, at which meeting the election of Directors herein before provided
for shall take place.Notice of said meeting shall be given to said
stockholders and stock subscribers by publication in the daily papers of Omaha
at least two days before the time fixed for holding said meeting," and the last
sentence of the Article was amended to read as follows:</p>

<p>"Special meetings of the board of directors may be held at any time and place
within the said County of Douglas, on call of the president or on call of
one-third (1-3) of the members of the board,"and further amended by adding to
said Article the following language:</p>

<p>"At all stockholders' meetings any stockholder or stock subscriber may vote who

regard to the amount represented," and substituting therefor the following
words:</p>

<p>"And at such meetings, one quarter (1/4) of the stock subscribed, present and
voting shall be considered a quorum."</p>

<p>The Committee appointed to act as a Bureau of Finance then met and considered
this action, and decided to accept same, upon agreement that following form of
subscription blank be adopted and used:</p>

<p>TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION.</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>STOCK SUBSCRIPTION.</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>We, the undersigned, hereby subscribe each for himself, and not one for
another, and agree to pay for capital stock in the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition, a corporation organized "to provide for holding,
beginning in the month of June and ending in the month of November in the year
1898, within or near the city of Omaha, in Douglas County, Nebraska, an
exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the States and
Territories of the United States of America, west of the Mississippi River, and
also such exhibits as may be provided by the United States, or any State in the
United States, or any foreign country, for the purpose particularly of
exhibiting to the world, the products, industries and capabilities generally of
the States and Territories west of the Mississippi River," equal to the amounts
hereinafter written opposite our names respectively; payment to be made at such
times and such installments as may be called for by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Provided, that not more than ten (10) per cent. of amount subscribed shall be
called during the year 1896, and not more than sixty (60) per cent. shall be
called during the year 1897, and provided further that no call shall be made
until the aggregate amount of Three Hundred Thousand ($300,000) Dollars shall
have been subscribed:</p>

<p>This was agreed to unanimously.</p>
<p>
Thus again was the good Exposition ship in safe water, with the prow pointed
toward Progress.</p>

<p>The Legislature of the State of Louisiana being in session in June and early
July, the Directors decided that an effort should be made to secure the
cooperation of that state.A delegation comprising of President Wattles, Thos.
Kilpatrick, Judge Macomber and Jas. B. Sheehan proceeded to Baton Rouge, La.,
where after diligent effort result stated in following telegram from President
Wattles, was secured.</p>

<p>"Baton Rouge, La. July 3rd, 1896. Too late to secure direct appropriation,
but concurrent resolution has just passed both houses, authorizing the Bureau
of Agriculture to make an exhibit, and pledging the state to pay for same."</p>

<p>Louisiana was therefore the third state to officially recognize and direct that
the state be represented at the Exposition.It is much regretted that
Louisiana was prevented, subsequently, from making a showing of exhibits at the
Exposition.</p>

<p>Attention was now given especially to the work of securing subscriptions, the
work was mapped out, Committees appointed and the campaign proceeded with vigor
and success.August 20th, $270,000.00 had been subscribed, but many large
interests held aloof, stating their desire to await results of the Presidential
Campaign, then in full force.Yet the Directors struggled on aiming to reach
the $300,000.00 amount by Sept. 1st, 1896.On Sept. 12th the Directors met and
received report of subscriptions.It was found that $320,000 was subscribed,
and that about $40,000.00 additional was assured.The Directors therefore
ordered that an assessment of Five (5) per cent be made on the capital stock
subscribed, payable prior to six o'clock p.m. Sept. 29th, 1896, and that a
stockholders meeting be called to be held in the Hall of the Board of Trade on
October 1st, 1896, at seven (7) o'clock P.M., to elect fifty (50) Directors, as
provided for in Articles of Incorporation.Sept. 25th, 1896, the Directors
were requested to give audience to a number of citizens and at once did so. 
There were present in addition to the full directory, Mssrs. C.F. Manderson,
Thos, Kilpatrick, C.W. Lyman, John S. Brady, Arthur C. Smith, A. T. Recotr, Wm.
A. Redick, E.M. Andriesen, M.T. Barlow, J.H. Millard, C.S. Hayward, Oscar
Williams, Frank Murphy, H. Kountze, W.A. Paxton, H.F. Cady, C.F. Weller, F.P.
Kirkendall, C.E. Yost, Edward Rosewater, O.C. Holmes, John Powers, W.W. Marsh,
A.L. Reed, E.E. Bruce, Sam'l Katz, Louis Huggins and others.</p>

<p>Mr. Manderson, as spokesman, stated that owing to the closeness of the times,
the excitement attending the campaign relating to the coming national
elections, debates on the money situation, and the fact that some individuals
and corporations that should subscribe largely to the Exposition, would not do
so, until after the November elections, and yet desired a voice in the election
of the Board of Directors, and was therefore aid that might be altogether lost
if election of Board of Directors was held, as now proposed and called, that,
therefore the gentlemen present desired to request that the proposed election
of Directors be deferred until some date in November 1896, say November 10th. 
The request was discussed, and a Directors' meeting was at once convened, and
Mr. Montgomery offered the following which was adopted:</p>

<p>"Whereas, More than forty (40) of the largest stock subscribers of this
Corporation, representing about one-half of the aggregate subscriptions, have
requested that the stockholders meeting, called for October 1st, 1896, be
postponed until November, 10th 1896, therefore,</p>

<p>Resolved, That the call for the stockholders meeting to be held October 1st,
1896, for the election of a Board of Directors, fifty (50) in number, be
rescinded and withdrawn, and that the said stockholders meeting be postponed to
and held on Tuesday, the First day of December, 1896 at seven o'clock p.m., in
the Board of Trade Hall, and that the Secretary be and he is hereby directed to
mail to each stock subscriber proper notice of this action, and that period for
payment of the Five (5) per cent assessment in stock subscriptions, heretofore,
made, be extended to November 28th, six o'clock p.m."</p>

<p>On October 9th, 6124 persons had subscribed the total amount of $343,080.00 and
still the canvas for additional subscriptions was continued.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other promotive work had been pushed, and particularly the efforts
to induce the holding of annual meetings of large organizations, conventions,
congresses, fraternal national meetings, etc., etc., and very gratifying
success had been achieved.The Governors of States in most of the
Trans-Mississippi Territory had appointed their State Vice-Presidents, and the
correspondence and circular work had grown to large proportions, and the
influences favoring the Exposition were ever widening and spreading.The
newspapers of the country generously published information regarding the
project, and a firm basis for the enterprise was being constantly strengthened.</p>

<p>November 27th Directors in meeting assembled were advised that the Burlington &amp;
Mo. River Railway Co., had subscribed $30,000.00.</p>

<p>This information was greeted with cheers of acclaim, for now the ice was broken
that overlapped the subscriptions of the various Railway Companies, the
Burlington system being the first to uncover and send in its subscription, and
it was confidently predicted that the other lines entering Omaha would soon
follow the good example of the Burlington lines.It had been a matter of grave
concern to the management that all efforts to persuade the various railway
lines to support the exposition by liberally subscriptions had failed to bear
fruit.Grateful appreciation of the action of the Burlington system was
expressed, and a resolution of thanks was ordered forwarded to them, both for
the subscription to the Exposition and for their further pledge to at once
proceed to build a new and commodious Passenger station, thus supplying a long
felt want, and forcing a general action on similar lines by the other Railways
entering the city.</p>

<p>With the election of new Board of 50 Directors, which occurred on December 1st,
1896, the first Board of (11) Eleven Directors with their labors, efforts, and
anxieties, became of the past, a thing apart.They had secured the Exposition,
put it upon a firm and sound basis, had exploited the enterprise finely, and at
a total expense to December 1st, 1896, of $3,898.36, a record indeed of which
to be proud.</p>

<p>Mention should not be omitted of the appointment of soliciting committees and
of the earnest and untiring labors of the committeemen in accomplishing their
tasks.Committees were designated to be particular class of vocations and
their energies were thus concentrated and directed toward the fullest canvas of
their particular allotment.These committees were appointed on July 11th, 1896
and were as follows:(Insert "A")</p>

and Manager of the Department of Promotion, as follows:</p>

<p>To the Board of Directors,</p>

<p>Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition:</p>

<p>Gentlemen:</p>

<p>I herewith resign my position as Manager of the Department of Promotion and
member of the Executive Committee.</p>

<p>I also take the liberty of recommending that President Wattles be elected to
succeed me for the reason that he is familiar with the work of the department
and in constant attendance at the Executive Committee meetings.</p>

<p>In resigning at this time I carry out my intention expressed at the time I
unwillingly accepted the position.It seemed to be desirable that I should
take the position, at least during the first few, troublous months, and I did
so.</p>

<p>The Departmentis now well organized and the work well in hand.Legislative
work is over and what remains to be done will be to build upon foundations
already laid.Were it notforthe pressure of private business I should be
glad to continue my agreeable relations as a member of the Executive Committee
and I regret the necessity which compels me to retire from the management.</p>

<p>(Signed.)G.M. Hitchcock</p>

<p>On motion and after much discussion, it was ordered that the Promotion
Department be consolidated with the Publicity Department.The following
substitute for Section IV of the By-Laws was offered and on motion,- agreed to.</p>

<p>"Resolved:That the following substitute for Section IV of the By-Laws be
adopted.</p>

<p>Section IV.EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE:The Executive Power and Administrative
authority of this Exposition shall be placed in the hands of an Executive
Committee of Six Directors, who, as such Committee, shall have full general
power and authority of the Board of Directors in all matters except such as
Board of Directors shall by resolution, specifically reserve to itself in

attention to the death of Director Dan Farrell, Jr. and the vacancy in the
directory therefore existing.Mr. Farrell was one of the men earliest
interested in the Exposition project.Was a member of the first Board of
Directors.Was always earnest and prompt in his support of the work, and his
genial good nature and happy disposition always brought the glad sunshine into
the deliverations of the Directors, and of committees, of which he was a
member.</p>

<p>On motion, Directors Rector, Wharton and Saunders were appointed to prepare
suitable resolutions relative to the decease of this valued member.</p>

<p>The next business was the election of a Director to fill the existing vacancy,
and nomination and ballot resulted in election of Mrs. Thomas ____ Hoctor of
South Omaha.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1897 much difficulty was experienced in holding meetings of
the directors on account of lack of a quorum, a majority of the Board, and much
feeling and discussion was indulged in over the seeming lack of interest on the
part of the Directors.This culminated August 28th, 1897 in the adoption of
the following:</p>

<p>"Resolved:That this Board of Directors may declare vacant themembership
of any Director who shall absent himself twice in succession from meetings
of this Board, while such member is in the city.Sickness only shall be
deemed sufficient excuse for such non-attendance."</p>

<p>LOCATING THE EXPOSITION</p>

<p>The location of a public enterprise deemed to be of general benefit to a whole
community, but of special and increased advantage to the locality immediately
surrounding the institution itself, isgenerally attended with special effort
on the part of those having opportunity for benefits, real or imaginary, toward
the selection of the location which seems calculated to best advance their
interests.This is an altogether human feeling, in consonance with the
commercialism of thisAge and, as all cannot be benefited in the same degree
by the same cause, it follows naturally that a rivalry should spring up over
the location of such a project as an Exposition of magnitude.At all events,
such was true in this case.</p>

<p>Immediately upon organization of the exposition Corporation the site question
came to the front.Council Bluffs was first in the field, advocating the
choice of a site in East Omaha, east of Cut-Off Lake, on land which, while on
the west side of the Missouri River, was really in the state of Iowa.The
Council Bluffs Exposition Committee, appointed by the Manufacturers and
Merchants Association of that city, presented resolutions to the Board of
Directors on February 10th 1896, stating that all support and aid from Council
Bluffs should be conditioned upon the choosing of the location urged by them,
otherwise they would withdraw their support.</p>

<p>On February 23rd a Mass-meeting of the citizens of Council Bluffs was heldin
the Superior CourtRoom of the County Court House to consider the Exposition
and their participation in it.They promptly passed resolutions as follows:</p>

<p>"Resolved, that the Merchant's and Manufacturer's Association of Council
Bluffs, meeting in conjunction with other citizens, heartily approve of the
proposed Exposition and that they render what help they can to the project,
Provided; that any National, state or city aid shall be conditioned upon an
assurance that the Exposition shall be located on a site within the boundaries
of what is known as East Omaha, such assurance to be in the form of a joint
pledge on the part of the Directory of the Exposition Company and the East
Omaha Land Company.</p>

<p>And be it further resolved that we request our representatives at Washington
and Des Moines to use their efforts to secure liberal appropriations for this
project, Provided:that such appropriations are made subject to the foregoing
condition, and to otherwise oppose any appropriations sought."</p>

<p>These resolutions with a large map of the proposed location, were printed in
the Daily Nonpareil of that city and copies were mailed to all the members of
Congress, the Iowa Legislature, state officers and to each of the Directors and
Officers of the Exposition.</p>

<p>In Omaha the advocates made haste to present arguments and petitions in favor
of various sites, viz:Elmwood Park, Southwest part of the city, Riverview
Park, in Southeast part of city, Miller Park, north of the city, Hanscom Park
location, in Southwest part of city but closer in than Elmwood Park, was later
put forward as a most advantageous location.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors, while admiring the zeal and enthusiasm of the various
advocates, yet deplored the seeming anxiety to locate something that was not
yet secured, being proposed and planned only.</p>

<p>On February 28th, 1896, the Board of Directors deemed it wise to define their
position on the subject, and the following was prepared and adopted by them.</p>

<p>"WHEREAS, to secure the largest success to the proposed Exposition, entire
harmony of feeling and effort should exist, to the entire exclusion of personal
and corporate interests, and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, it is deemed unwise and impracticable to endeavor to hold said
Exposition without the recognition of Congress, and National encouragement
through appropriations providing for National buildings and Exhibits,
THEREFORE, Resolved that for the purpose of carrying out the purpose of the
proposed Exposition, it is indispensably necessary,</p>

<p>First, That an Act of Congress be passed, recognizing and endorsing the
Exposition and providing an adequate appropriation for National Buildings and
Exhibits.</p>

<p>Second, The securing of subscriptions to the capital stock of this corporation
to an amount sufficient to guarantee the successful promotion and conducting of
the enterprise to a complete and honorable conclusion.And,</p>

<p>Resolved, That until the foregoing pre-requisite aids are secured, we deem it
impolitic, inopportune, and unwise to discuss or seriously consider the
matter of the location.For, until said necessary aids are secured we
cannot assume that there is any Exposition to locate.And Be it Further
Resolved, That at the proper time a fair and impartial hearing will be given to
all parties interested in the various sites proposed, and that a location will
be selected with due and fair consideration to the interests of all concerned."</p>

<p>This action calmed the sea that was becoming troubled, and all interests united
to aid in securing pre-requisite aids.</p>

<p>In October, 1896, the aids referred to having been secured, the site boomers
were to the fore again, and each location had its special representatives.The
greatest verbal argument and epistolatory efforts were devoted to the Miller
Park and Riverview Park sites; though, as time passed the Hanscom Park site's
advantages seemed to become more and more prominent.</p>

<p>The meeting of stockholders had been called to meet December 1st, 1896 and
great were the efforts to secure proxies of stockholders, that Directors
favorable to this or to that site might be aided to an election.</p>

<p>The new Board of Directors having been duly elected, were at once in the midst
of a contention over the matter of location and proceeded to consider and
determine the subject without delay.</p>

<p>December 16th, 1896, the Board of Directors adopted the following resolutions.</p>

<p>"Resolved, that the selection of the site for location of the Exposition, and
the appointment of all committees, officers or agents to investigate proposed
sites shall be made by the full Board of Directors, and that these questions
shall not be settled, nor any powers delegated by the Board of Directors,
except by majority vote at a meeting regularly called for that purpose.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the secretary is hereby authorized to receive sealed proposals
for the location of the Exposition until Saturday noon, January 9th, 1897, and
shall open and read said propositions to this Board of Directors at a meeting
which shall be held at 2 o'clock p.m. on Saturday, January 9th, 1897.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That said propositions shall specify,</p>

<p>1st,-The number of acres of land offered, and the boundaries thereof.</p>

<p>2nd,-The use of what streets, roads and private ways approaching said land,
which will be open for public use during the construction and operation of the
Exposition.</p>

<p>3rd.-All other inducements, including donations or subscriptions of stock,
which may be offered."</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>January 9th, 1896. (sic.)45 Directors present.</p>

<p>The responses to the request for propositions for location for the Exposition
were then opened and read by the secretary.Propositions were received
covering the following locations.</p>

<p>Riverview Park and adjacent thereto.</p>
<p>East Omaha Site.</p>
<p>Hanscom Park and North and West of same.</p>
<p>Miller Park and adjacent thereto.</p>
<p>Elmwood Park and the state Fair Grounds.</p>

<p>After the reading, the following resolution was presented and adopted</p>

<p>"Resolved, That a committee of three (3) be appointed, consisting of Casper E.
Yost, J. H. Millard and R. S. Wilcox, to whom shall be referred all the
propositions pertaining to the selection of the site for the location of the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition; and that said committee be
authorized and empowered to employ a good non-resident engineer and a good
non-resident Landscape Architect to carefully go over and examine all of the
proposed sites and make out a report in writing of their findings and
conclusions pertaining to the sites which have been proposed.Said report,
when so prepared to be delivered to said committee and by them referred to the
full Board of Directors at a special meeting to be called January 23rd, 1897 at
2 o'clock p.m. for action, without any recommendations of said committee as to
its views or conclusions, as to the most desirable site to be selected."</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>January 23rd, 1897.49 Directors present.</p>

<p>Owing to the disposition to defer the opening and reading of the Report of
Committee on Sites, until after the Nebraska Legislature had taken action on
the bill in aid of the Exposition, and now pending, it was ordered that the
committee shall have two weeks from this date, in which to hand in its report.</p>

<p>February 6th, 1897.42 Directors present.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Committee on Site submitted the report of the Committee,
bearing the date of January 18th, 1897, to which was attached the report of the
experts employed,- Messrs. A.C. Shrader and H.C. Alexander, both of Chicago,

purposes.</p>
<p>Second,- Transportation facilities by Street car, steam railway and
other vehicles.</p>

<p>February 10th, 1897.36 Directors present on rollcall.
After some preliminary skirmishing, a ballot was proceeded with, resulting as
follows:</p>

<p>18th Ballot, MILLER PARK,-- Babcock, Bidwell, Brown, Bruce, 
Creighton, Hibbard, Hussie, Jardine, Kilpatrick,
Kountz, Lee, Lyman, Markel, Metz, Millard, 
Murphy, Paxton, Rector, Saunders, Wattles,
Webster, Weller, Wells, Wharton, Wilcox, 
Wilhelm, Yost, Youngs,
Total,--28.
HANSCOM PARK,-- Brandeis, Carpenter, Dickenson,
Evans, Farrell, Hitchcock, Holdrege, Johnson,
Kimball, Kirkendall, Korty, Lindsey, Manderson,
Montgomery, Noyes, Payne, Price, Reed, 
Rosewater, Smith, (Arthur C.) Smith (Dudley)
Thompson,
Total,--22.</p>

<p>The following Directors were voted on letters and telegrams received by the
secretary.</p>

<p>Bidwell, Babcock, Dickenson, Evans, Kirkendall, Korty,
Lee, Markel, Paxton, Rosewater, Smith (Dudley), Thompson,
Wilcox, Wells.</p>

<p>Mr. Manderson moved that Miller Park be the unanimous choice of the Directors
for the location of the Exposition.Carried unanimously by a standing vote.</p>

<p>Mr. Connell moved three cheers for Miller Park and the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition.And thus did the location seem to be finally
chosen,- but such was not the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkendall, as Manager of Department of Buildings and Grounds, had visited
the Miller Park site frequently, and was much impressed with the feeling that
the location was too far from the city, (something more than four miles) and
feared the distance would tend to minimize the city attendance, an important
factor in Exposition attendance.He quietly sought to ascertain if a nearer
site could not be so arranged for, as to be available, and being successful in
this, he advised with the Executive Committee concerning it, resulting, at
Director's meeting of March 13th, in appointment of a committee under the
following:</p>

<p>"Whereas, a public demand has risen for the location of the Exposition at point
at near as possible to the business center of the city, therefore,</p>

<p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this Board that, if proper arrangements can
be made, the old Fair Grounds site should be selected as the location of the
Exposition.For action upon this matter the President is hereby authorized to
appoint a special committee of three, consisting of the President, Mr.
Kirkendall and Mr. Wharton, to consider the details of a proposition to locate
at the old Fair Grounds site.</p>

<p>This Committee shall report in full at an adjourned session of this meeting of
the Board of Directors, to be held at 4 o'clock P.M., Wednesday, March 17th,
1897."</p>

<p>At said meeting the Committee reported at length and in detail, in effect,that
sufficient ground could be secured for the purposes of the Exposition, lying
between 24th Street east to the river bluff east of Sherman Avenue, and from
Pinckney Street, north to Ames Avenue, and at an expense, practically, of the
taxes for the years 1897 and 1898.Mr. Herman Kountz generously offered, not
only the use of what was called the Kountz tract, but offered to sell to the
Exposition 11 acres of said tract for $15,000.00, of which amount he would
donate $5,000.The said tract to be deeded to the city of Omaha and to be
forever kept maintained by the city as a Park, and to be known and called
Kountz Park.The opportunity being so favorable it was,-</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the action of this Board, locating the Exposition at the Miller
Park site, be reconsidered, and if so reconsidered, the vote thereafter shall
be taken upon arelocation at Miller Park site from the Old Fair Grounds site;
and that no other site be considered, and that voting by proxy, either by
letter or wire, be received as to such relocation."</p>

<p>The vote on the proposition was then taken, resulting in 37 votes in favor of
the resolution and no votes against.</p> 

<p>The details in connection with the leasing and purchase of the required
properties, was by vote, referred to the Executive Committee, who completed
alldetails, secured all needed lands, executed the leases and arranged with Mr.
Herman Kountz for lease of what was termed the "Kountz Tract": and arranged
with him also for purchase of 11 acres to comprise what should be called
KountzPark.Which agreement was prepared and presented to the Board of
Directors at meeting July 9th, 1897.Resolutions approving the agreement and
authorizing its execution, were adopted as follows:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition accepts the
proposition of the United Real Estate and Trust Company with reference to the
donation by said company of tract of number one (1) to the city of Omaha for
park purposes and the purchase from said company of tract number two (2) by
said Exposition to be by said Exposition donated to said city for park
purposes, which proposition is contained and said tracts described in a written
contract and lease entered into on the 17th day of April, 1897, by and between
said Exposition and said company, and that, in full compliancewith, and
absolute discharge of, all of its obligations arising or existing by virtue of
said proposition and with reference to said tracts, said company be, and is
hereby authorized and directed to execute a good and sufficient deed, conveying
to the city of Omaha, both of said tracts, subject to the following conditions: 
first,- That said tracts of land shall forever be conjointly used and
maintained as a public park, with the right of the city of Omaha to erect and
maintain on either or both thereof, any park or other buildings suitable and
proper to be erected and maintained on park grounds; second That said tracts of
land shall forever be conjointly designated and known as Kountz Park; third,-
That during the years 1897, 1898 and 1899, no curbing,paving or macadamizing
shall be placed or laid on Twentieth Street in said city, from Locust to
Pinckney Street, at the cost of the owners of the property abutting upon said
portion of Twentieth Street; fourth,- That one or more drive-ways and walks
shall be constructed and forever maintained through both of said tracts from
east to west, which shall be kept open at all times, for public use, and
subject to such reasonable limitations, rules and regulations as may be
prescribed by the Board of Park Commissioners or by the Mayor and Council of
said city; fifth,- That during the year 1897 the sum of, at least, five
thousand dollars ($5,000) shall be expended by said city through its Board of
Park Commissioners, in making improvements upon said tracts; sixth,- That the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a corporation organized and
existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, for the
purpose of holding an exposition in said city, shall have the right to use both
of said tracts for exposition purposes, during the years 1897, 1898 and, if
required by the said Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, during 
the year 1899.And said United Real Estate and Trust Company be, and is hereby
further authorized and directed to execute a deed, conveying to said city, for
street purposes, and as a public street for the use and benefit of the property
abutting thereon, and of the public, the strip of land lying between said
tracts; that both of saidconveyances shall be subject to the taxes upon the
lands described therein, which may be levied and those which may become
delinquent during the year 1897, and of the right to the use and occupation in
and to said lands of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition; that
the secretary of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition be, and is
hereby authorized and directed to deliver to the First National Bank of Omaha,
Nebraska, a certified check of said Exposition, in the sum of fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000) in payment of said tract number two (2), in accordance with
said proposition, and with directions to said bank to deliver said check to
said United Real Estate and Trust Company only upon the delivery of said deeds
by said city, and upon thedelivery to said Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition of the certified check of said United Real Estate and
Trust Company in the sum of five thousanddollars ($5,000) which shall be in
full of the donation agreed to be made to said Exposition by said company in
said written contract."</p>

<p>The site as secured and used, and the properties comprising same are
specifically designated on the following plat of grounds.Thus was the
location finally determined upon, secured and used, and great credit must be
given to Manager Kirkendall for discovering and his discretion in practically
securing this location.For without this change of location, it is certain
that the financial success which came to the Exposition, would not have been
realized, for nothing seems to be more certainly proven that, an Exposition to
be successful, must be located as near the center of population as is possible,
that easy, quick and comfortable access thereto may be had.</p>

<p>Meeting of April 19th, 1897.Quorum present.</p>

<p>Speaking to the subject under consideration, viz:the making of further
assessments upon stock subscriptions, Mr. Manderson referred to the expressed
doubts of our citizens as to whether it was wise to go on with the Exposition
in view, particularly of the fact that the adjoining states had not made the
Legislative provisions for participation which it was expected and hoped they
would do.Mr. Hitchcock spoke feelingly on the subject, and said that
everything pointed to success; that this Exposition was greatly advanced over
other previous Expositions at a like period in their history and offered the
following resolutions which was promptly adopted.</p>

<p>"Resolved:That there is no grounds for the vague rumors concerning a possible
postponement of the Exposition, and that the progress of the Exposition is
satisfactory."</p>

the Exposition was made due and payable, June 1st, 1897.</p>

<p>Meeting of June 19th, 1897.33 Directors present.</p>
<p>The following, from the Executive Committee with recommendations for adoption,
was presented.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That for the purpose of securing, speedily benefits to the
Exposition, arising under the act of the Nebraska Legislature, the Executive
Committee recommends to the Board of Directors that the 35% of subscriptions
not assessable under the terms of the subscriptions, until 1898 be subject to
discount of five (5) per cent, if paid by or prior to June 10th prox.And that
the Secretary be authorized to accept payments on this basis."</p>

<p>After discussion of twenty minutes, adopted.The following was also adopted.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the thirty-five (35) per cent of subscriptions to the
Exposition not assessable until 1898, be not subject to discount until the
previous sixty-five (65) per cent has been paid."</p>

<p>The legislative act referred to contained a provision that no money should be
available under the act, until there had been paid to the Exposition Treasury,
by subscribers, the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
($250,000.00), and the state commissioners being anxious to proceed with their
duties, action as above seemed necessary and politic.</p>

<p>On motion, a further assessment of twenty (20) per cent was made in
subscriptions to the Exposition, due and payable on or prior to August 1st,
prox.</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>At meeting October 12th, 1897.36 Directors present.</p>
<p>The executive Committee presented the report of the special committee
previously appointed by it to examine into and report upon various charges
preferred against Mr. Dion Geraldine, Superintendent Building and Grounds
Department, charging that in his conduct of affairs he usurped the powers and
prerogatives of the Executive Committee, was guilty of willful deception,
indefensible partiality to contractors, flagrant disregard of the interests of
the Exposition, and expensive incompetency.</p>

<p>The report of the committee was very full and lengthy, and was read to the
meeting. The pith of it was contained in its concluding paragraphs, which read
as follows:</p>

<p>"It appears from all the testimony submitted to your committee that in his
administration of the duties connected with his employment, Superintendent
Geraldine has not had that regard for the manager of his Department, and for
the Executive Committee that would seem proper, by way of submitting general
information concerning the work to his manager and to the Executive Committee,
through his manager in order that the approval and endorsement of the manager
of the Department might be securedin advance of actual execution of proposed
details; and it would seem that this was a matter of which could be remedied
for the benefit of the service.If Superintendent Geraldine remains in the
employ of the Exposition he should in all cases adhere strictly to the rules of 
the Department and instructions of the manager.The subordinate employee
should and ought to be willing to keep in close touch and report fully to and
act under clearly stated instructions of the Department manager.</p>

<p>We are unable to discoverany indications of dishonesty on the part of the 
Superintendent or any employee connected with the Exposition, and believe the
controversy tobe one of misunderstanding of the motives and positive acts
which can readily be adjusted in future transactions by a union of heart and
sentiment in the great work by all under the guiding wisdom of the Executive
Committee as a whole.</p>

<p>Your Committee would extend its influence in its present relations as a special
committee and recommends that such a result be arrived at.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosewater offered the following:</p>

<p>"Resolved, that the services of Dion Geraldine, Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds, be dispensed with from and after this date."</p>

<p>After a very full, free and spirited discussion of the situation, on motion, a
note by ballot was taken on the resolution of Mr. Rosewater, resulting 12 votes
for, 22 votes against.Chair declaredthe resolution lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosewater thereupon tendered his resignation as a member of the Executive
Committee, effective October 15 inst.Without action thereon the meeting, on
motion adjourned.</p>

<p>Meeting October 19th, 1897.40 Directors present.</p>
<p>Mr. Manderson presented the following.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the Board of Directors of the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International
Exposition regret the conflicts that have arisen, growing out differences of
opinion, among those charged with the actual work of preparation for the
exposition; realizing fully that success can only be secured by the harmonious
action and earnests co-operation of all interested in the enterprise and
particularly among those charged with Executive power."</p>

<p>In the matter of the charges preferred before the Executive Committee against
an employee of the Exposition, charged with the superintendence of the Grounds
and the erection of buildings, the Board endorses the action of the Executive
Committee in the appointment of Directors Kountz, Bidwell and Wells as a
Committee of Investigation andexpresses its conviction that the findings of
this committee, made after full, careful disinterested and impartial
investigation, were just and true, and that the conclusions of fact reached by
them are worthy of credit and belief.So believing the Board of Directors
approve the same by the adoption of the following resolution:</p>

<p>"Resolved:That we affirm our confidence in the wisdom integrity and
efficiency of the President and Officers of the Exposition, and the members of
the Executive Committee.Amid adverse and untoward circumstances, under
undeserved criticism, without reward or the expectation thereof and at an
immense personal sacrifice of time and expenditure of labor they have pursued
their course.</p>

<p>If mistakes have been made they have been minor and unimportant and only those
usually incident to enterprises of great moment.With this expression of
confidence we declare our unswerving purpose to hold up their hands and aid
them with all our force and power to carry on this greatwork to the full
success that means so much for the Trans-Mississippi Country, and particularly
for this state and community."</p>

<p>On vote, Roll-call, the resolution was referred to the Executive Committee. 
Yeas 32.Nays, 8.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosewater then stated that in view of this resolution, referred to the
executive Committee, he withdrew his resignation as a member of the Executive
Committee and would await its action on the resolution.</p>

<p>Meeting October 28th, 1897.29 Directors present.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkendall presented the resignation of Superintendent Geraldine and
advised that it had been accepted by himself and the Executive Committee,
effective at once, with full pay for the month of October.Letter of
resignation was as follows:</p>

<p>Omaha, Nebraska</p>

<p>My Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I am informed that it is claimed by certain parties or elements that my
retention as Superintendent of your Department threatens the success of the
county bonds of $100,000.00 for the Exposition to be voted on next week.
While I feel keenly the utter injustice of such a a claim, I cannot consent to
be in any sense, nor in any degree an obstacle to the success of the
Exposition.</p>

<p>I therefore tender my resignation to take effect at your option.
I shall always be deeply grateful to you for the manly unwavering support and
confidence you have steadily given me.I am thankful to your Executive
Committee for its kind indulgence and endorsement: and to your Special
Committee of the Directory for its fearless vindication of my character and
ability.</p>

<p>Very truly yours,</p>
<p>(Signed) Dion Geraldine</p>

<p>The following communication advising of recommendations of Executive Committee
was then read, as follows:</p>

<p>"Omaha, Neb. Oct. 28th, 1897.</p>
<p>Board of Directors,</p>
<p>Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition,</p>
<p>Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>

<p>For the purpose of presenting to you the object of this meeting, the following
extract from the record of proceedings of Executive Committee at meeting held
Oct. 27th is given:</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock of the Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, at meeting
held Oct. 19th, Committee consisting of Messrs. Hitchcock, Hoctor and
Montgomery, reported a proposed form of contract by and between the Exposition
of the one part and the Building Trades Council &amp; Central Labor Union of the
other part, covering the subject of wages and hours for skilled workman on
constructive work.The various points of the agreement were discussed, and it
was thought advisable to have legal counsel on some of the points, and Messrs.
John L. Webster and W. J. Connell were sent 
for, and consulted with on the subject.</p>

<p>As a result of the conference, Mr. Rosewater drew up and presented the
following resolution:</p>

<p>RESOLVED, That from and after this date, all contracts for construction which
shall be awarded by the Exposition, shall provide that the Union scale of
wages, as appended, in force on October 1st, 1897, shall govern in the payment
of skilled labor, and that eight hours shall constitute one days work,
providing that extra shifts of eight hours may be used without overtime charge.
Resolved, that for all skilled labor employed directly by the Exposition, the
union scale of wages and eight hour day, as provided above shall prevail."</p>

<p>Mr. Rosewater moved, Mr. Reed seconded, that this Committee recommended to the
Board of Directors their approval of the foregoing resolution, a meeting of the
Directors for this purpose be called to meet to-morrow, October 28th, at Four
o'clock P.M.Motion carried, six votes "Aye"</p>

<p>On motion, the resolution and scale of wages were adopted unanimously.</p>

<p>Meeting November 12th, 1897.30 Directors present.</p>

<p>Mr. President stated that he understood that some of the Directors thought it
wise to have a Director General to the Exposition, and perhaps some other
changes in the Organization.If there was such feeling, opportunity was now
offered for its expression.</p>

<p>The subject was discussed by Directors Kilpatrick, Wharton, Rosewater, Kountz,
Kirkendall, Lee, Lindsay and Youngs, resulting in appointment of a committee
consisting of Directors Kountz, Bidwell, Carpenter, Manderson and Webster, to
consider the subject and report to a special meeting.</p>

<p>SPECIAL MEETING, November 15th, 1897.34 Directors present.</p>
<p>Report of Special Committee was presented and read as follows:</p>

<p>"TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition,</p>

<p>Gentlemen:</p>

<p>Your special committee, appointed at the meeting of the Board held on November
12th, to investigate and report upon the question of the appointment of a
Director General or some other supervising officer, to promote the energetic
completion of the arrangements for the Exposition, beg leave to report as
follows:</p>

<p>Your committee has held an extended conference with the Executive Committee and
discussed the entire situation as fully as it was possible to do, the President
of the Exposition and all members of the Executive Committee being present, and
are pleased to report that a substantial consensus of opinion was eventually
arrived at, that the present situation does not seem to make it necessary that
the office of Director General be created at this time, but that the work of
all the departments might be energeticallypushed perhaps, more satisfactorily
than by any other arrangement, by the appointment of a General Superintendent,
a practical builder, at a maximum salary of $200.00 per month, whose office and
headquarters should be upon the Exposition Grounds, and who should be placed in
charge ofall work in the line of construction of any or all of the
departments, with the express duty of overseeing and pushing all such work to
energetic completion.As the greater proportion of the work would be in the
Department of Buildings &amp; Grounds it would seem advisable to Your Committee,
that the nomination of such an officer should be conceded to the manager of
that Department, and that such nomination should be approved by the Executive
Committee in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Your committee have had under consideration certain amendments to the By-Laws,
touching the powers and duties of the President, but have not sufficient time
to conclude its deliberations on this subject and would ask that it have
further time to consider and report on the same.</p>

<p>Herman Kountz,</p>
<p>Chairman."</p>

<p>On motion, the report and the recommendations contained therein, were approved.</p>

<p>At Meeting January 19th, 1898.26 Directors present.
The Executive Committee recommended that assessments be made on the
subscriptions to the Exposition of the 35% payable in 1898, as follows</p>

<p>20% due and payable on or prior to February 1st, 1898.</p>
<p>15%"" """" " March 1st, 1898.</p>

<p>and that a discount of one (1) per cent on the unpaid portion of subscriptions
be allowed of subscription be paid in full prior to February 1st, 1898.</p>

<p>On motion, the recommendations were adopted and the assessments ordered in
accordance therewith.</p>

<p>On request the secretary presented a statement of the financial situation, as
follows:</p>

<p>Total subscriptions to this date,--------------------$490,080.00</p>
<p>Assessments made 65%,----------------$318,552.00</p>

<p>If all vouchers drawn were issued and paid an </p>
<p>overdraft would exist of----------------------$5,109.13</p>

<p>The situation was discussed pretty generally, but no action was taken beyond
considering the suggestion of issuing $250,000.00 of Bonds secured by a portion
of gate receipts.</p>

<p>Meeting February 11th, 1898.33 Directors present.</p>
<p>Continuing discussion of finances of the Exposition, Mr. Manderson moved</p>

<p>"That the Manager of the Ways &amp; Means Dept. be instructed to bring suit within
30 days against all subscribers of $500.00 and upward, who were, in his
opinion, good on execution, who are delinquent on their subscriptions to the
Exposition."</p>

<p>Motion agreed to.</p>

<p>Meeting April 8th, 1898.31 Directors present.</p>
<p>Secretary presented an accumulation of protests received, protesting against
the sale of liquors on the Exposition grounds during the period of the
Exposition.After consideration the following, prepared by Mr. Manderson was
adopted.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That it is the sense of this Board of Directors that the same policy
be pursued by the management that was pursued at Philadelphia, Chicago and
other Expositions, and that is, that the sale of beer and light wines be
permitted, but that open bars and the sale of whiskey etc. be prohibited</p>

<p>Again considering the finances of the Corporation it was ordered that Ways &amp;
Means Department be instructed to institute suit against all delinquents on
subscriptions of $50.00 or over, who shall be delinquent on May 1st prox.The
subject was still further considered but no further action was taken.</p>

<p>Meeting April 12th, 1898.28 Directors present.</p>
<p>The following was presented and on motion, adopted.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That it is the sense of the Board of Directors that the Executive
Committee should not enter into any contract or let any concession, in which a
member of the committee is directly or indirectly interested, without first
advertising for bids."</p>

<p>Meeting May 9th, 1898.34 Directors present.</p>
<p>For a considerable period past, there had been arguments advanced by a few of
the Directors that a Director General should be appointed or elected and that
the best interests of the Exposition would be advanced by such action.On May
6th, on the call of 17 Directors for a special meeting to consider this
subject, a meeting was convened, but after some discussion adjourned until May
9th without action.On May 9th the subject was again discussed, and the
Chairman of the Executive Committee presented the following as representing the
views of all, excepting one of the Committee.</p>

<p>"WHEREAS, the Executive Committee fails to see the necessity for a Director
General, General Superintendent or General Manager and Staff, who, as is
contemplated, shall exercise supreme Executive authority in all matters
pertaining to the Exposition, and furthermore, believing that no such necessity
exists, therefore, be it</p>

<p>Resolved, 1st.That it is unwise at this late date, to change the general plan
of organization, and the present method of conducting the business of the
Exposition.</p>
<p>2nd. That we recommend that the title of General Superintendent be abolished,
and that said title be changed to that of Superintendent of Dept. of Buildings
&amp; Grounds.</p>

<p>(Signed)(Z.T. Lindsey</p>
<p>(E.E. Bruce</p>
<p>(W.N. Babcock</p>
<p>(A.L. Reed</p>

<p>Mr. Rosewater stated that he regretted his inability to concur in the
conclusions of his colleagues of the Executive Committee, and that when all was
said and done, he still deemed it his duty to recommend the enlargement of the
powers of the General Superintendent, subject only to such legislative
restriction by the executive committee as shall keep the supervisory executive
power in his hands.</p>

<p>After submissions of various resolutions and the offering of various motions, a
motion was offered that the whole subject be laid on the table, which motion
prevailed, not however, until roll-call was demanded Ayes 19. 
Nays 15.</p>

<p>Meeting May 13th, 1898.37 Directors present.</p>
<p>The request for Director General, General Manager, General Superintendent, or
some or any such officer, was again placed before the Directors, and after much
more discussion of the matter, the following was prepared by Mr. Manderson and
offered for action thereon.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That a General Manager, to be selected by and to be under the
direction of the Executive Committee, be placed in charge of and held
responsible for the orderly, economical, and systematic conduct of affairs in
the Exposition grounds, and be in full charge thereof; suggesting to the
Executive Committee such general rules and regulations or changes therein may
produce the best results.</p>
<p>Such suggestions of Rules and Regulations shall be acted upon and be subject to
the approval of the Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Such General Manager shall have the power, for cause, to summarily remove and
discharge any employee of the Exposition employed in the buildings or on the
grounds of the Exposition, except the Superintendents of Departments, and shall
immediately report his actin in that behalf and give the cause for such
discharge to the manager of the Department in which such person is employed."</p>

<p>Vote was then taken on the resolution in a call of the roll.Ayes 34?</p> 
<p>Nays 1.</p>

<p>The executive Committee subsequently, on May 23rd, 1898, elected Mr. Thaddeus
S. Clarkson as such General Manager.Mr. Clarkson had been previously engaged
in assisting the President in his duties, and his services continued, under the
title of General Manager, to the close of the Exposition.</p>

<p>At the same meeting, after full discussion, the following resolution was
adopted.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That is the sense of the Directors of this Exposition that there
should be no free list or passes to the Exposition on and after June 1st, 1898,
except as follows:</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Exposition.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Bureau of Entertainment.</p>
<p>Vice-Presidents, and the Commissioners of countries, states and territories.</p>
<p>Executive Officers of countries, states, Territories</p>
<p>Exhibitors.</p>
<p>Concessions.</p>
<p>Employees in actual discharge of their duties.</p>
<p>Newspaper representatives, as per rules.</p>
<p>Mayor and City Council of Omaha.</p>
<p>Board of Omaha Fire and Police Commissioners.</p>
<p>Board of Education.</p>
<p>Board of Park Commissioners.</p>
<p>Board of County Commissioners. (Douglas County.)</p>
<p>Sheriff of Douglas County.</p>

<p>The subject of finance was then again taken up for consideration.It was shown
that $700,000.00 has already been disbursed, but that about $300,000.00 more
was needed to properly take care of the liabilities and expenses up to opening
day and the cash on hand amounted only to the sum of $1,570.89.The usefulness
of a loan of funds was very apparent therefore, and the Executive Committee had
been unable to borrow any funds on the notes of the corporation.A committee,
to whom the situation had been referred after consideration of the subject,
reported the following as their recommendation, for action.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That an issue of $200,000.00 negotiable bonds be, and is hereby
authorized to be secured by a mortgage upon 50% of the gross receipts
(exclusive of stock subscriptions and donations) from June 1st, 1898, and upon
all the buildings and other property of the Exposition on the grounds, and an
assignment of the insurance on said buildings.</p>

<p>That the bonds be issued in denominations of $500.00 each, to draw interest at
seven (7) per cent from date and to be payable pro-rata from the mortgage
receipts or otherwise, on or before the first day of November, 1898, on call of
the Trustees, and that said bonds be sold at not less than par, and that three
trustees be appointed by the Executive Committee, to whom the mortgage shall
run and who shall receive, hold and disburse the mortgaged property in payment
of said bonds.</p>

<p>Resolved, That installments of said bonds be paid on the first day of July,
August, September, October and November 1898, the amounts of such installments
to be determined and directed by the trustees, and that the said bonds provide
that the interest shall cease on each installment from the date the same became
payable, as ordered by the trustees."</p>

<p>On Motion, the resolution was adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Manderson of the Committee, further reported that for the better
safeguarding and protection of the bonds above provided for, he offered the
following:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That all employees who are paid by the month, shall be paid,
beginning June 1st, 1898, part in cash and part in warrants as follows:</p>

<p>Those receiving $50.00 and under per month, 75% in cash and 25% in warrants.</p>
<p>Those receiving $50.00 to $75.00 per month 70% in cash and 30% in warrants.</p>
<p>Those receiving $75.00 per month and over 60% in cash and 40% in warrants.</p>

<p>Resolved, further that all contractors to whom payments are now due, or to
become due, shall be paid 50% of their dues in cash and 50% in warrants.And,
Resolved, further, That all warrants shall draw seven (7) per cent interest per
annum from their date, to be registered by the secretary, and to paid by the
treasurer in the order of their registration as cash funds may be in the
treasury, available for such purchase.</p>

<p>On motion, the foregoing was adopted, all voting aye.</p>

<p>It proved to be impossible to dispose of the bonds by subscription, the banks
and other financial institutions entertaining doubts as to their authority to
invest deposits in bonds of this character, and the business men of the city
felt that the banks ought to arrange to take at least, one half of the issue of
bonds.Else the business men should not be held to take any of them.The
bonds and the mortgage to protect them, were prepared, providing that Joseph H.
Millard, President Omaha National Bank, and Charles W. Lyman, President of the
Commercial National Bank, Frank Murphy President Merchants National Bank,
should be the trustees required, but none of the bonds were ever issued and
were eventually destroyed by a committee appointed for that purpose.On May
30th, the Executive Committee found a condition present that required action. 
The Treasury was $14,000.00 overdrawn and unpaid contractors were clamoring for
their dues, and it was threatened that measures taken by creditors might
prevent the opening, June 1st.To meet this emergency, The President,
Secretary and Members of the Executive Committee, subscribed to a fund to carry
the enterprise over the shoals, taking the corporation notes for the amounts;
which notes were subsequently paid.</p>

<p>Regarding the resolution for issue of warrants, their issue under the
resolution proved to be impracticable, and the Secretary was compelled to use
his best judgment in the dealing with creditors and be guided largely by the
conditions surrounding each case, and conclusions were reached requiring the
issue only of warrants, aggregating $35,488.17 and notes of the corporation
aggregating $47,502.63.The handling of the indebtedness was materially aided
by the Treasurer consenting to an overdraft on funds of $20,000.00.No
warrants were ever offered or issued to employees.</p>

<p>At same meeting, a number of protests against Sunday opening were presented and
the Sunday opening question, which had long been held back was taken up for
consideration.After considering various motions and resolutions the following
was presented and adopted:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the Exposition Grounds and Buildings be kept open on Sundays
from One (1) p.m. to Ten (10) p.m. and conducted in the same manner as on week
days, except that the sale of liquors be not permitted; that concerts be given
and that religious services be held in the Auditorium on Sunday afternoons."</p>

<p>The following was also offered and adopted on recommendations of the Executive
Committee.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the title of General Superintendent be abolished, and that the
present General Superintendent be retained under the title of Superintendent of
the Buildings and Grounds Department."</p>

<p>DIRECTORS,</p>

<p>After June 1st, 1898.</p>

<p>Meeting June 24th, 1898.27 Directors present.</p>

<p>Mr. Manderson offered the following resolution, which were unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>The Directors of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, in parting
with the professional services of the Architects-in-Chief of the Exposition,
their great work being now accomplished, desire to express their unbounded
satisfaction with the result and their unqualified approval of the methods that
have been pursued.The World has not seen a more perfect aggregation of
buildings than those that constitute the Exposition proper and the able
Architects who designed them, are entitled to the enthusiastic praise that
comes to them from all who view them.Much credit is due to all, and, with no
desire to be invidious, the Board desires particularly to commend the ability,
skill and devotion of the Architects-in Chief, Messrs Walker &amp; Kimball of
Omaha.On behalf, not only of the Exposition, but of the Trans-Mississippi
country, we extend to them our congratulations and hearty thanks.</p>

<p>We recognize also the skill and ability of Mr. Rudolph Ulrich, Landscape Artist
and of Mr. Luther Steiringer, Electrician and Mr. Henry B. Rustin, his
Assistant, and thank these gentlemen for the magnificent results we have found,
in which they have been prime factors.</p>

<p>Resolved, That copies hereof be sent to the gentlemen named and be published in
the Press."</p>

<p>Meeting July 21st, 1898.30 Directors present.</p>

<p>Certain disquieting reports of irregularities, mismanagement and misdoings in
various branches of the Exposition, and grave charges affecting the character,
reputation and conduct of persons employed by the Exposition had been
circulating for some time, and the need for a thorough investigation of all of
the books, records and papers of the Exposition had been editorially urged in
the Omaha Bee.And the Directors considered that, in justice to all parties,
and especially to those under accusation it would be wise to provide for an
investigation and audit of all affairs, and therefore, the following resolution
was presented and adopted:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That a Board of Revision, audit and investigation is hereby created,
consisting of five members of this Board, exclusive of the Executive Officers
and the Executive Committee, who are hereby empowered and directed to make a
thorough examination of the books, papers and records of all departments,
without interfering with their active operation, and that said Board is hereby
authorized to employ one or more expert accountants of clerks and stenographer
and that the officers and employees of the Exposition shall, upon request,
furnish all information called for by said Board.And that said Board shall
make report from time to time, of its findings and conclusions to the full
Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the duties of the Board of Revision, Audit and Investigation, be

Epoch in the history of our County.</p>

<p>Meeting October 7th, 1898.Quorum present.</p>
<p>The Exposition period now drawing toward itsclose, it was urged by some that

same be dismissed without prejudice."</p>

<p>Meeting November 11th, 1898.31 Directors present.</p>
<p>Contentions having arisen as to just what constituted a stockholder and it
being deemed wise to more clearly state the privileges extended to subscribers
for stock, the following resolution was presented and adopted.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That all stock subscribers who have paid a part of their stock
subscription, may pay the balance thereof before December 1st next, plus costs
where suits have been begun, and thereupon certificate shall issue to them and

<p>Meeting November 16th, 1898.28 Directors present.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee reported the proposals received for the buildings and
other property of the Exposition, and after consideration of them, it was
ordered by a roll-call vote, Ayes 16 Nays 12, that the proposal of Peter E.
Iler, et al. to pay $17,500.00 for all of said property and materials, be
accepted subject to conditions as follows.</p>

<p>Sale to include only such interest as the Exposition owns in the property at
this date, and does not include the books, papers, bills and claims or cash of
the corporation.</p>

<p>Sale to be consummated, purchase money paid and possession given on or before,
November 21st next.Purchasers shall procure releases to this corporation from
the principal property owners to restore to them their real estate, and
provided that a good and sufficient bond shall be given by the purchasers on
date of transfer, to perform their several agreements.Should Peter E. Iler et
al, fail to complete the transaction by said November 21st, then the Executive
Committee shall sell the buildings, materials, and appurtenances to the highest
bidders on the proposals heretofore received."</p>

<p>The sale was duly consummated on November 21st, 1898, the money paid, and the
properties delivered over to the purchasers and a conclusion was reached by the
Exposition so far as the physical properties were concerned.</p>

<p>Referring to resolutions adopted October 7th, provided for the appointment of
an Historical Committee.The Committee had proceeded with their work and had
assembled a large amount of exhibits, souvenirs, mementos, etc. for
preservation, but were stopped from proceeding further by a restraining order,
secured from the District Court at the instance of Edward Rosewater, he making
the claim that as Manager of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, the
duty of editing and supervising the production of a history of the Exposition
was one that peculiarly and properly belonged to him.</p>

<p>The restraining order of the court was based upon the claim that, as the
Articles of Incorporation did not specifically grant the authority to publish a
history, that therefore the Directors had no authority to use the money of the
stockholders to aid in such publication, even though as contemplated, the
temporary use of the funds was all that was needful, the sales being expected
to fully re-imburse the monies advanced.</p>

<p>At this meeting the situation was discussed with much feeling, and as a result,
action settled into the simple adoption of the following resolution:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the Executive Committee are hereby directed to resist and
defend injunction proceeding of the said Edward Rosewater vs. the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition and are authorized by the
employment of counsel and the taking of all needed proofs to carry on such
defense that the order and wish of the Board of Directors as heretofore
expressed, may obtain."</p>

<p>The defense was made as directed but the temporary restraining order was made
permanent, and hence no result as ordered and desired could follow, except that
the valuable souvenirs thus far collected were assembled, and by arrangement
with the Public Library Board were all deposited in a Musee room in the Public
City Library, for view, where they yet remain, with the Fine Art Paintings
purchased by the Exposition and donated to the Public Library for public use
and benefit.</p>

<p>Meeting April 7th, 1898.Quorum present.</p>
<p>The following was adopted.</p>

<p>"Resolved, That a 12-1/2% distribution of assets be ordered to paid up
stockholders.Payable April 10."</p>

<p>Meeting June 30th, 1902.25 Directors present.</p>
<p>This meeting had been called by the President on authority of the Executive
Committee, to close up the affairs of the Exposition, by receipt of final
reports, etc. and disposal of the balance of funds on hand.The meeting was
held at the Omaha Club, and after a splendid banquet had been enjoyed, the
business of the meeting proceeded.There were also present as guests of the
Director, Architect-in-Chief Thos. R. Kimball.Supt. of Light &amp; Power Henry
Rustin and, as representatives of the Press, Mr. Victor Rosewater of the Omaha
Bee and E. C. Hunt of the World Herald.</p>

<p>The committee appointed July 21st, 1898 as a board of Revision, Audit and
Investigation, now submitted their report, which was as follows:</p>

<p>"Omaha, Neb. October 8th, 1900.</p>
<p>Mr. G. W. Wattles,</p>
<p>President of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I send you on behalf of the Auditing Committee what may be considered its final
report.The same consists of three papers marked respectively "A", "B" and "C"
and fifty-two other reports numbered from one to fifty-two inclusive.
I also enclose you a statement, somewhat in the form of an index showing what
these fifty-five papers refer to.</p> 

<p>These papers were submitted to Mr. J. C. Wharton and C. W. Lyman, G. H. Payne
and E. C. Price, the other members of the committee.you will notice that Mr.
Lyman in a letter, which I enclose, calls attention to reports forty-five,
forty-six and forty-nine; and I may say that these reports contain about all
that is if any special importance in our report.It is the unanimous opinion
of the committee that even these show only clerical errors, and though all the
work appears in the name of Mr. John A. Wakefield, it is well known to the
committee that these errors happened without his knowledge, as his time was
more than occupied with other important duties in connection with the
Exposition.It is also known to the Auditing Committee that a desire for
economy on the part of the Executive Committee led them to apportion work to
Mr. Wakefield which properly belonged to a separate department, and which
should have, from the beginning, been under the management of a competent
auditor.</p>

<p>It will be remembered by the Board of Directors that there were vague reports
as to loose management and perhaps fraud in connection with the several
departments of the Exposition, and it was for that reason that the auditing
committee was appointed.</p>

<p>VINDICATION OF MANAGEMENT.</p>

<p>It therefore affords me great pleasure to say upon behalf of the auditing
committee that after a most thorough and painstaking investigation, both by the
committee itself and by its paid agent, Mr. W. S. Streeter, we failed to find
any fraud or mismanagement in any of the departments; and we are satisfied that
the success and honest management of the enterprise on the part of
subordinates, were due to the close attention, business ability and integrity
of the president, the secretary and the executive committee.</p>

<p>It seems to the auditing committee like presumption to even mention the
president and executive committee in this report, but inasmuch as the duties of
the committee covered an investigation of all connected with the management of
the Exposition, we feel it to be a duty, as well as a pleasure, to say that we
know them to have performed their various and arduous duties, constantly with a
view to the best interests of the Exposition and with absolute integrity.</p>

<p>On behalf of the auditing committee,</p>

<p>Thomas Kirkpatrick, Chairman."</p>

<p>On motion, approved and ordered spread upon the records.</p>

<p>Director Wharton moved that a committee of three (3) be appointed by the
secretary, and of which the secretary shall be chairman, to select and secure a
proper and suitable gold medals, to be presented to the President and each of
the Executive Committee in token of high regard of the Board of Directors for
their honorable and self-sacrificing services to the Exposition.Motion
carried unanimously.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey, chairman, made a report for the Executive Committee, as follows:</p>

<p>"The Executive Committee beg leave to report that all lawful claims against the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition have been fully paid, and that
there remains on hand the sum of about $2,000.00.</p>

<p>The committee believing it impracticable to disburse this balance among the
large number of its shareholders, and recognizing the efficient services of Mr.
John A. Wakefield, Secretary of the Exposition, hereby recommends that this
balance be paid to the Secretary, as additional compensation for his services
in the past and in full for his work in the compilation of a statement of the
affairs of the Exposition, including a recital of the inception, organization,
operation management and results of the Exposition. which statement shall be
submitted by him to a committee consisting of Chas. F. Manderson, Chairman,
Isaac W. Carpenter, Chas. W. Lyman, Carroll S. Montgomery, and Edward
Rosewater, to be revised and approved by them, and afterwards filed in the
Public Library of the City of Omaha, or published by private subscription, or
by any corporation, firm, or individual, having first obtained the consent and
approval of the above named committee.Said publication to be without expense
or liability to this corporation."</p>

<p>On motion, report and recommendations were unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Montgomery, General Counsel, then offered the following:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That all the acts and proceedings of the Executive Committee, and of
the officers of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, from the
commencement of the corporation to this date, as shown by the records of the
corporation, are hereby approved and ratified."</p>

<p>On motion, resolution was adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Montgomery as General Counsel, also offered the following, which was, on
motion, unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>"Whereas, all lawful claims and demand, and obligations of the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition have been paid and all of the
funds and property of said corporation have been disposed of and properly
distributed and disbursed, and the objects for which said corporation was
organized have been fully consummated and performed.Now, Therefore, Resolved,
That the said corporation be dissolved and that further business by or in the
name of the corporation be discontinued."</p>

<p>There were held in all sixty-four (64) meetings of the Board of Directors, 37
prior to the opening of the Exposition and 27 thereafter.Director John A.
Johnson takes credit for attendance at every one of these meetings, with
Director Thomas Kilpatrick a close second, he having been absent but one
meeting.</p>

<p>The ways and means part of any organization or enterprise, is always one of the
most important and one to which most careful thought and attention is
absolutely necessary.It is doubly important in any project of semi-public
character, and more particularly so in an enterprise such as the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition was to Omaha and its citizens. 
The success or failure of any enterprise is very largely dependent upon the
Ways and Means Department, and while success does not always bring a shower of
credit to those to whom it is due, yet certain it is that failure always brings
condemnation and opprobrium upon, not only those to whom it may be justly due
but upon all who had to do with its government and management.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF SUBSCRIPTIONS</p>

<p>The Ways &amp; Means Department of the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition took charge of this branch of the work after subscriptions
aggregating $404,720.00 had been secured, as evidenced by the certificate of
the committee appointed to review the subscriptions obtained up to December
1st, 1896 (See General Operations, page _____)and the task of securing
further subscriptions to an adequate amount, and of making collections of the
assessments on the subscriptions, was at once begun and pursues with
indefatigable energy.This kind of effort is familiar to many and it is
unnecessary to dwell upon the details of it in this case, but only to give
results.</p>

<p>Manager of this department by untiring effort of himself and of aids called to
his assistance, succeeded in increasing the subscriptions by $221,242.70,
making the aggregate amount of subscriptions to the Exposition $625,962.70, of
which amount there was collected the sum of $548,415.20, or eighty eight (88)
per cent of the entire subscriptions.</p>

<p>When the financial situation and possibilities of the years 1896 and 1897, are
considered it will be quickly granted that this was a remarkable record of
collections of such a general and promiscuous subscription list.</p>

<p>The subscriptions to the Exposition were in number and amounts as follows:</p>

<p>DISBURSEMENTS</p>

<p>All the disbursements of monies of the Exposition, was upon the order and
direction of the Executive Committee.A regular approved form of disbursement
voucher was used, showing the authority of the Executive Committee, checked and
signed by the Auditor, certified as being correct by the Secretary and approved
for payment by the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.They were then
ready to present to the treasurer of the Exposition, and when properly
receipted became a sight draft upon the Treasurer, payable on being presented
at the First National Bank of Omaha.</p>

<p>Pay rolls, incidental and minor expenses were paid by Secretary's check upon a
special account, which were in turn protected by the regular disbursement
voucher when issued in due course.</p>

<p>In disbursing the funds of the Exposition upwards of 29,000 secretary's checks
and 5,000 disbursement vouchers were issued.</p>

<p>In the receipt of Exposition monies, amounting to nearly $2,000,000.00 it is
worthy of note that but $4.52 of counterfeit, spurious, defaced or defective
coin was found, and no counterfeit, or bad notes were sent back to the
secretary, and all of the monies of the Exposition was deposited in bank, thus
passing the careful scrutiny of the Bank's teller, splendid detectors of bad
notes or spurious coin.</p>

<p>The books and accounts of the Exposition being kept in this department,
statements are submitted showing general ledger balances at closing, debit and
credit.Also statements showing total receipts of the Exposition from all
sources, the disbursement of said receipts both by departments and by
requisition, and a summary of treasurer's statement showing all funds
disbursed, is herewith given.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Admissions, Guardian of the Gates, is one of the most important
divisions of an exposition in operation, and each Exposition has tried to
profit by the experience of all previous Expositions in adopting the best
methods of issuing tickets and providing checks upon the ticket sellers and
ticket takers.The Bureau of Admissions of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition
followed this plan, but being unable to find experienced men who were
absolutely trustworthy, the bureau believed it was the part of wisdom to secure
the services of honest men, even if their experience had to be gained at the
expense of the Exposition.By reason of inexperience some vexatious delays
occurred at the opening of the Exposition entailing considerable annoyance, but
no serious loss.The greatest care and utmost vigilance was exercised by the
Department to prevent abuses and even fraud on the part of unscrupulous ticket
and pass holders.The matter of tickets of admission, their sale and
redemption at the gates is a comparatively simple transaction, but in the
multitude of pass admissions which must of necessity occur, the troubles of the
bureau are mainly found.Special rules covering the transactions of the
Admissions Bureau, providing for sales of tickets, etc., accounting for same,
providing methods for issuance of passes of all kinds, and manner of record of
same, were adopted and issued, but their length prohibits their insertion in
this work, and no special reason exists for their publication.</p>

<p>One general form of paid admission tickets was used varied in colors, and
colors changed from day to day, and sometimes several times in the same day, in
order that the closest record could be kept, and by using absolute checks
ascertain where irregularities existed and locate them exactly.</p>

<p>For pass admissions, a number of separate forms, as well as colors were used,
the system devised was by comparison, as good and as safe as any that has yet
been used at any Exposition.</p>

<p>Previous to the opening of the Exposition a special commutation coupon
admission book was designed, photograph of holder inside front cover, good only
for the photographed holder, and containing detachable coupons, one for each
admission.Books of this kind, as a means toward pre-exposition revenues were
sold at $20.00 for 100 admissions, $12.50 for 25 admissions.Their value and
use was not generally understood and the sales were not large.They are a good
style of admission, however, to benefit both the exposition and the purchaser.</p>

<p>For photographic coupon admission books to exhibitors concessionaires,
employees, a charge of $2.50 each was made up to July 1st and $2 after that
date.These books admitted the purchaser only during the exposition period,
unless for some cause, their employment ceased, when the books were taken up,
canceled and destroyed.The charges on this class of pass admissions was made
only to cover their cost in various ways, to the exposition, and were hence
classed as free admissions.Pass admissions were provided of various kinds, in
series, each series bearing a different letter, and were as follows.</p>

<p>Series A.Complimentary Season Pass.</p>
<p>Series B.Complimentary Term Pass.</p>
<p>Series C.Complimentary Press Term Pass.</p>
<p>Series D.Paid Commutation Coupon Books.</p>
<p>Series E.Full Term Photographic Coupon Pass for Exhibitors and Concessionaires.</p>
<p>Series F.Monthly Photographic Coupon Pass for Employees of the Exposition, Exhibitors and Concessionaires.Books refilled
at end of each month that employees services were retained.</p>
<p>Series G.Complimentary Trip Pass.</p>
<p>Series H.Complimentary Press Trip Pass.</p>
<p>Series I.Workman's Card Pass, for short terms of employment.</p>
<p>Series J.Full Term Wagon Pass, admitting Concessionaire with his own 
goods.</p>
<p>Series K.Waiters Single Admission Pass, used for temporary increase
of forces at restaurants, etc.</p>
<p>Series L.Card pass permitting the crossing of 20th Street at Manderson
Street.</p>
<p>Series Z.Sleeping permit, photographic, permitting holder to sleep upon the
grounds, used for various employees required to remain on
premises at night.</p>

<p>About 160 employees were required in Bureau of Admissions including office
force, ticket sellers, ticket takers, inspectors, checkers and detectives.</p>

<p>There were seven (7) regular entrances to the exposition grounds.There were
six (6) wagon gates and twenty-two (22) exits.Thirty-six (36)
self-registering turnstiles were used for checking and record purposes at the
seven admitting entrances.</p>

<p>The record of the gates, showing admissions of all kinds on each day of
Exposition, the records of the office showing cash receipts from all sources,
for each day of the Exposition, will be found in the subjoined table.

<p>BUREAU OF SOUVENIR COINS</p>

<p>Under the Act of Congress giving recognition to the Exposition, provision was
made for the establishment and operation of a United States coining press in
the Government Building on the Grounds.It was planned to provide an
Exposition souvenir coin, to be coined upon such press, that would be
especially typical and appropriate.It was decreed that upon the obverse side
of the medal should be impressed the best composite type of Trans-Mississippi
womanhood.This was obtained by collecting the photographs of the handsomest
women of the states and territories of the Trans-Mississippi country, secured
through the various state Vice-presidents, two from each state and territory,
from which the composite photograph was secured.</p>

<p>The reverse side of the medal was modeled after a design submitted by Thomas R.
Kimball of Omaha, representing an Indian spearing a buffalo and was indicative
of the period when the Trans-Mississippi region was new and unknown.</p>

<p>By special arrangement, the dies for these coins were made at the United States
Mint at Philadelphia, Penn. at a cost of $400.They were all "coined" at the
press in the U.S. Government Building and sold from there and other points on
the grounds.About 25,000 in all were "coined" and sold.The net cash results
attending their issue and sale were as follows:</p>

<p>Total cash receipts,.....................$5,963.00</p>
<p>Total expenses and charges,..............$3,027.63</p>

<p>THE MUSIC OF THE EXPOSITIONS, by THOMAS J. KELLEY, Musical Director.</p>

<p>The music of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition marked an epoch
in the development of the musical appreciation and in the actual musical
history of the Great West.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of people who represented the great "Corn Belt", were
patrons and patronesses, in more or less degree, of the many musical feasts
afforded by the management of the Exposition.</p>

<p>No Exposition, before or since, has done so much for the cause of good music
and the popularizing thereof in its own particular locality.The
Trans-Mississippi Exposition was open but five months and in that time many
strong musical organizations, local and visitant, appeared to add lustre to the
occasion, and incidentally to add lustre to themselves.</p>

<p>The celebrated Theodore Thomas Orchestra of Chicago, held sway for five weeks
under the skillful conductorship of Mr. Arthur Mees, for some time assistant
conductor to Mr. Thomas, now conducting (1903 January) the "People's Concerts"
in New York and other large eastern musical societies, and eminent as an
authority on musical matters, as well as a writer of no mean parts, his last
work, "Choirs and Choral Music" published by Scribners', being a masterpiece in
its line.Lest some should say that the real strength of the orchestra was
missing it is sufficient to note that Emil Bare (now of Paris) was
Concert-meister, Bruno Steindel was the Solo Cellist, Schuecker, the harpist
and Quensel the solo flute, and the other instruments were also represented by
the first men.</p>

<p>The Apollo Club of Chicago gave several concerts under the personal direction
of Mr. William L. Tomlins, who work is too well known to require further
endorsement herein, and who was the conductor of the society.This
organization presented the "Swan and Skylark" (Goring-Thomas), "The Messiah"
(Handel) (in part) and the "Elijah" (Mendelssohn), combining also with the
Exposition Chorus of 150 voices, in "al fresco" concerts.</p>

<p>The Minneapolis Choral Society, under its conductor, Mr. Willard Patten, gave
"Issaih" a work composed by him, bringing to the production a chorus of about
200 voices.</p>

<p>The Dubuque Choral Society, under the conductorship of Mr. Portius Gane, the
"Creation" (Haydn) and "Barbara Frietszche" (Jules Jordan), with about 150
voices.</p>

<p>The Exposition Chorus of Omaha gave (with its 150 singers) "Fair Ellen (Max
Bruch) the "Rose Maiden" (Cowen), the "Daughter of Jairus" (Stainer) and
innumerable miscellaneous numbers at concerts in the Auditorium, on the Grand
Plaza and by the Lagoon.</p>

<p>Assisting in the production of these works, which were given with the full
orchestra, were the following; distinguished artists; Genevieve Clark Wilson;
Helen Buckley, Jenny Osborn, Sophia Markel, Anna Metcalf (Sopranos); Katherine
Fisk, Mabelle Crawford and Estelle Rose, (Contraltos) George Hamlin, Holmes
Cowper and Stowe, (Tenors) Charles W. Clark (now of Paris) and Homer Moore
(Baritones) Frank King Clark and Edmund Kuss (Basses).And in addition to
these there were many lesser lights.</p>

<p>There were bands galore.The United States Band, under the baton of Mr.
Phinney, formerly of the Iowa State Band.</p>

<p>The Mexican Band, under the chivalrous and suave Capitane Richardo Pacheco.</p>

<p>Innes, and his famous fifty, who captivated the people beyond measure at the
close of the Exposition.</p>

<p>Santelmann and his great U.S. Marine Band, the President's own band from
Washington D.C., who opened the Exposition.</p>

<p>Space forbids the mention of the numerous smaller bands which did good service
and were engaged a week at a time.</p>

<p>The organ in the Auditorium, a fine three-manual, was a feature of the musical
department, organ recitals being given daily at 1:30 p.m. by Mr. Thomas J.
Kelley and others.The organ was built by Moeller of Hagerstown, Md. and was
opened by Harrison Wild of Chicago.</p>

<p>The musical policy was outlined largely by Mr. Zachary T. Lindsey, Chairman of
the Executive Committee, and was developed and carried out by Willard Kimball
of the Nebraska University, up to June 30th and by his successor, Thomas J.
Kelly of Omaha, from July 1st to the close of the Exposition on October 31st. 
Miss Julia Officer of Council Bluffs was engaged to assist the Bureau as a
manager of artists.</p>

<p>The music of the Exposition was planned in such a way as to please all
visitors.It was broad in its scope and, while entertaining, it was also
highly instructive.It will not be soon forgotten.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter doublespace ">

<p>BUREAU OF SPECIAL ATTRACTIONS.</p>

<p>There was a multitude of special attractions supplied.Balloonists, Day-light
fire-works, High wire walking, High Diving, Log Rolling, Boat races, etc.,
etc., all of a character to fill in and round out the daily programs.</p>

<p>The special feature of the special attractions, however, was the splendid fire
works exhibitions displayed under provisions of contract with the A.L. Due Fire
Works Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who were the official Pyrotechnists of the
Exposition.They were the finest ever seen in the west and were greatly
admired and praised by those who have seen and judged the best exhibitions of
fireworks given in the United States.The total cost of fireworks was rather
more than $12,000.00.</p>

<p>Special musical attractions were also provided, notably the Theodore Thomas
Orchestra, and the Apollo Singing Club, both of Chicago.These organizations
with other musical matters, are specially referred to in this record under the
title of MUSIC BUREAU.</p>

<p>The chiefest special attraction perhaps, was the Indian Congress, which is also
treated separately under the title of "THE INDIAN CONGRESS."</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF PUBLICITY AND PROMOTION.</p>

<p>Edward Rosewater, Manager</p>
<p>James B. Haynes, Prof. Max Edler.</p>
<p>Supt. Press Bureau.In charge Issues
through German Press
0000-------</p>

<p>With this department rested the very important work of very thoroughly and
broadly advertising and promoting the features and interests of the Exposition. 
In the beginning, as noted elsewhere, there was the Department of Publicity
organized as above noted and the Department of Promotion, of which Mr. G. M.
Hitchcock was the Manager and Mr. Ernest C. Hunt, assistant.The Promotion
Department was maintained and operated under this organization until Mr.
Hitchcock resigned from the work on account of the pressure of private
business, on July 9th, 1897.Under Mr. Hitchcock's management much promotion
work was accomplished in all of the states and territories.The campaign for
an appropriation from the state of Nebraska was conducted and concluded with
favorable results.</p>

<p>One of the features planned by Mr. Hitchcock was the holding at Omaha, during
the Exposition period, of a Military Encampment, national in character, to be
in charge of U.S. Military Department and to comprise some regiments of the
United States troops of the various arms of the service, and also, a regiment
or more of state troops from each of the states of the United States or so many 
thereof as could be induced to participate.The plan was received with much
favor by the chief officials of the Army and, under direction of Maj.-Gen. John
J. Coppinger, then in command of the Department of the Platte with headquarters
at Omaha, made a careful examination of the plan, location, facilities, etc.
and reported favorably on the project.Much correspondence and effort were
expended in the further promotion of the plan, and the plan was so generally
favorably considered that the future was bright with promise of successful
fulfillment but the fear of coming war with Spain retarded the work and the
breaking out of actual hostilities effectually prevented the results hoped for.</p>

<p>Upon the resignation of Mr. Hitchcock the Department of Promotion was merged
with the Department of Publicity and thenceforth both branches of the work were
conducted under the management of Mr. Rosewater. Through this department in
its separated parts and as later joined in one department, and also through the
able efforts of the Commercial Club of Omaha and the various organizations of
the city, aided by individual effort, about one hundred conventions,
congresses, national and state gatherings of fraternal societies, etc., were
induced to hold their meetings for 1898, at Omaha during the period of the
Exposition. Some of them were as follows:</p>

<p>At the suggestion and through the efforts of the manager of this department,
the United States Postal Department issued a series of postage stamps
commermorative of the Exposition and of scenes, actions and accomplishments
incident and pertaining to the Trans-Mississippi region.They were issued in
denominations of one cent, two cent, four cent, five cent, eight cent, ten
cent, fifty cent, $1 and $2 values, the particular description of them is as
follows:</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi stamps differ materially in size from the ordinary
series, the engraved space being about seven-eighths of an inch in width by one
and three-eighths inches long.The designs are also radically unlike those of
the ordinary stamps, - consisting of a border (substantially the same in all
denominations except that the figures and letters representing values are
different) and a central scene, indicative in some way of the development of
the great region beyond the Mississippi River.The scenes and borders are all
printed from lined engravings on steel, executed by the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing of the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>The border, which forms in its inner lines an irregular oval framework to each
of the scenes represented, consists of a fluted figure on either side, with
interior cross bars, beginning in a single line near the bottom of the stamp
and enlarging until it reaches a shield in each of the upper corners, wherein
is engraved in white the Arabic numeral of denomination, - the dollar mark
being also included in the case of the one and two dollar stamps.At the top,
connecting the two shields and united to the fluted framework on the two sides,
is a curved tablet, on which are engraved in small white capitals the words,
"United States of America."Above this on either side are heads of wheat and
between these is a small scroll.Immediately below the central scene is the
title of the picture, in diminutive white gothic letters on a curved tablet,
and below this in either side, in scrolls are the words of value "one" "two"
and so on, in white capitals, except in the case of the two highest
denominations, when $1.00 and 42.00 are substituted for letters.Above each of
these is a projecting ear of corn, and at the bottom of all on a straight black
tablet are the words "Postage One Cent.", "Postage Two Cents.", and so on in
white capitals.</p>

<p>The scenes represented on the stamps, together with the colors of the several
denominations, are these:</p>

<p>One Cent,"MARQUETTE ON THE MISSISSIPPI", from a painting by Lamprecht, now in
the possession of the Marquette College of Milwaukee Wisconsin, representing
Father Marquette in a boat on the upper Mississippi, preaching to the Indians. 
Color dark green.</p>

<p>Two Cent,"FARMING IN THE WEST."from a photograph, representing a western
grain field with a long row of plows at work.Color copper red.</p>

<p>Four Cent,"INDIAN HUNTING BUFFALO."reproduction of an engraving in 
Schoolcraft's History of the India Tribes. Color orange.</p>

<p>Five Cent,"FREMONT ON ROCKY MOUNTAINS."modified from a wood engraving,
representing the Pathfinder planting the United States flags on the highest
peak of the Rocky Mountains.Color dark blue.</p>

<p>Eight Cent, "TROOPS GUARDING TRAIN."representing a detachment of United
States soldiers convoying an emigrant train across the prairies, from a drawing
by Frederick Remington, permission to use which was kindly given by the
publisher, R.H. Russell of New York.Color dark blue.</p>

<p>Ten Cent,"HARDSHIPS OF EMIGRATION."from a painting kindly loaned by the
artist, A. G. Heaton, representing an emigrant and his family on the plains on
a 'prairie schooner', one of the horses having fallen from exhaustion.Color
slate.</p>

<p>Fifty Cent, "WESTERN MINING PROSPECTOR."from a drawing by Frederick
Remington (permission to use which has been kindly given by the publisher, R.
G. Russell of New York) representing a prospector with pack mules in the
mountains searching for gold.Color olive.</p>

<p>One Dollar "WESTERN CATTLE IN STORM."representing a herd of cattle by the
leader, seeking safety from a gathering storm, reproduced from a large steel
engraving after a picture by J. McWhirter, the engraving having been kindly
loaned by Mrs. C. D. Johnson.Color light brown.</p>

<p>Two Dollar"MISSISSIPPI RIVER BRIDGE."from an engraving a representation of
the great Eads bridge over the Mississippi at St. Louis.Color sapphire blue.</p>

<p>They were issued in amounts as follows:</p>

<p>100,000,000 One cent stamps</p>
<p>200,000,000 two cent stamps</p>
<p>5,000,000 four cent stamps</p>
<p>2,000,000 eight cent stamps</p>
<p>5,000,000 ten cent stamps</p>
<p>500,000 fifty cent stamps</p>
<p>50,000 one dollar stamps</p>
<p>50,000 two dollar stamps</p>
<p>a total of 322,600,000 stamps.</p>

<p>Regarding the publicity work of the department the reports filed show that the
department sent out 1,422,974 issues of 32 page pamphlets, news letters, cuts
of buildings, photographs, bird's eye views, framed pictures, posters, buttons,
etc., causing wide publicity to the enterprise.</p>

<p>The department estimates upon a careful and conservative basis, that they
secured the publication in the various great dailies, weeklies, magazines,
ready prints, etc., of as much as 65,000,000 words concerning the Exposition by
the Omaha Newspapers.</p>

<p>As to promotion work the reports files show that the promotion work was
prosecuted energetically and as a result of special and combined efforts 35
states and territories appointed commissions to provide and look after state
and territorial representation in the Exposition.</p>

<p>The following appropriations were made to cover the expenses of participation
in the Exposition;</p>

<p>State of Nebraska,............................$100,000</p>

<p>In the building of a great exposition the first steps naturally are to
organize, exploit and secure the funds with which to proceed to that portion of
the "Building of an Exposition" which includes all of the physical features,
and is usually covered by the term BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee planned that the buildings should be of the highest
character for the purpose, and then, that as many of them would be built as
wants should require and the funds allow; that the grounds should be made
beautiful by their transforming from a series of cornfields, as they were when
secured, to a fine retreat of green velvety grounds, well shaded by a plenteous
supply of large trees and beautified by a generous planting of greens and
flowering bushes and plants, the whole to be handsomely and brilliantly lighted
with electricity.To this end the Department Manager was empowered to arrange
for the services of Messrs. Walker &amp; Kimball of Boston and Omaha as
Architects-in-Chief, with Mr. Rudolph Ulrich of New York, N.Y. as Landscape
Architect, and with Mr. Luther Stieringer of New York, N.Y. as Consulting
Electrical Engineer.The work of these three divisions of the general scheme
are specially treated under separate headings, by those best fitted to write
upon the subject, having most intimate knowledge of them.</p>

<p>The site for the Exposition was not finally secured until late in March, 1897. 
Great rivalry existed over the choice of a site for the Exposition, between the
friends of the five proposed sites, which resulted, on February 10th, 1897, in
choice of Miller Park, but on viewing the situation and finding that the
grounds finally obtained and used, could be had, Manager Kirkendall set to work
to advocate and obtain the needed change of judgment and vote of the Board of
Directors on this subject, which was had at meeting of Directorson the date
named, March 17th, 1897.</p>

<p>The first work on the grounds was under the contract with Van Court and Winn to
grade out the lagoon designed as a central feature of the Kountz tract, or main
court, and this work was begun on April 28th, 1897.</p>

<p>On April 22nd, 1897, the "Corner stone" of the Arch of States entrancewas
laid with appropriate Masonic ceremonies, preceded by a great civic parade, and
was the iniatory ceremony on the grounds of the Exposition.</p>

<p>July 7, 1897, the first contract for the building was awarded, being for the
"Administration Arch", first planned to house the offices of the
administration.Work was begun on this contract on July 15th, 1897, just ten
and one-half months prior to the time set for the opening of the completed
Exposition.</p>

<p>Working forces were organized, the grading of the grounds and the Lagoon was
proceeded with, buildings were designed, contracted for and pushed forward
toward completion, a system of sewers and water supplywas devised and placed,
machinery for power and light was secured, mainly on an exhibitor's basis,
Electric supplies were leased and purchased, much of it being leased, the power
plant was installed, an artesian well was bored which did not prove to be of
value, owing to the scant flow of water, a Hospital Department was organized
and established, the main court around the Lagoon was paved with bricks, all
other roads were macadamized, with a top dressing of fine gravel, a complete
and sufficient guard force was organized, secret service detectives were
employed, and the multitude of large and small affairs pertaining to this
department were closely looked after, always with an eye single to effect,
service and economy.</p>

<p>The usual labor disputes were to be expected and they were in evidence, but the
Department Manager conducted these disputes with such tact and with such
evident disposition for fairness, that they at no time became serious, and 
were usually settled to the satisfaction of both parties and with good feeling
resulting.</p>

<p>Some particulars in regard to a number of the divisions of the is department
are as follows:</p>

<p>LANDSCAPING.</p>

<p>Report of Rudolph Ulrich, Landscape
Architect, to be inserted.)</p>

<p>THE LANDSCAPING OF THE EXPOSITION.</p>

<p>Landscape Architect, Rudolph Ulrich, New York City</p>

<p>Architect Ulrich at the close of his work prepared and delivered a report on
the same, but in some manner the report has been lost or mislaid and it is not
therefore possible to incorporate the same in this history.A very diligent
search has been made to secure this report, which search has proved fruitless,
as have been the efforts to communicate with Mr. Ulrich and secure from him
either a copy or a newly drawn statement of the great work performed under his
direction and supervision.From memory such data as is now obtainable the
following statement of the work of the Landscaping Department is given.</p>

<p>When the grounds used by the Exposition, were secured by lease from the owners,
the larger part had been used for the growing of corn crops and the stalks and
stubble of the previous year were still upon the ground.This was particularly
true in relation to the Kountze tract and Bluff tract.On the north tract a
part of the ground had been used as a County Fair grounds, having thereon a
fully equipped, half mile racing course.The North tracts and Bluff tracts
required but little grading and such grading as was done thereon was for the
purpose of leveling and shaping the ground for landscape effects.As to the
Kountze tract, the west end was some 17 or 18 feet lower than the eastern end
and in planning for the lagoon and lake occupying the center of said tract, it
was necessary to remove large quantities of earth from the excavations for the
lagoon to build up the western end of the grounds, making provision for the and
protecting Mirror Lake, which was there situated.</p>

<p>The Kountze tract, 2950 feet long by 680 feet wide, containing 43 acres, the
Bluff tract 3447 feet long by 50 feet wide, containing 38 acres, the North
tract, embracing 87 acres with some small parcels comprising about 16 acres,
required for intercommunication, comprised the grounds used by the Exposition,
a total of 184 acres.</p>

<p>The work of the Department was begun April 27th, 1897, the first being the
excavation for the Lagoon, the top soil being removed and held for use after
all grading work had been completed.The excavations for the lagoon were
completed at the end of June.It required the removal of 108,000 cubic yards
of earth, which was accomplished by a force of 52 men, at a cost of $11,735.97. 
The construction of the embankment of the Lagoon required 4939 linear feet of
sheet piling, which was secured at a cost of $7,104.14.The capacity of the
Lagoon and Mirror Lake was 13,000,000 gallons and covered seven and one half
acres.</p>

<p>The excavated material, which amounted to 118,103 cubic yards was used for the
raising of the ground at its west end and for terraces on which the buildings
surrounding the main court were erected.Besides the material secured from the
excavation 170,000 additional cubic yards were required for grading and for the
construction of approaches to the viaducts and the various buildings.The
grading on the Bluff tract and the North tract was comparatively small, but the
entire amount of earth handled on the three tracts of ground was 376,750 cubic
yards, at a cost of $19,404.56 or an average cost 5.15 cents per cubic yard.</p>

<p>The construction of road ways and walks was an important feature of the
landscaping, the total area of plazas, drive and walks was 125,018 square yards
or 35,952 linear feet, equal to 6.6 miles.Crushed limerock was used for
these, a depth of four inches being laid on the roads and two inches on the
walks.The crushed lime rock was given a top covering of fine gravel, the
whole being well packed by the use of a heavy steam roller.The total quantity
of crushed rock and gravel used was 16,111 cubic yards.This feature of the
landscaping cost $32,587.82 which included its maintenance during the
Exposition.The entire work was performed during the Spring of 1898 with a
force of 12 men, 8 teams, a steam roller, and a water sprinkler.The cost of
these walks, including maintenance, was 17.4 cents per square yard.The cost
of driveways, including maintenance was 22-1/2 cents per square yard.</p>

<p>In the Grand Court, in the small areas under the colonnades, the approaches to
bridges, a brick pavement was laid, a very superior brick was used, well bedded
on three inches of sand.This brick paving was contracted at a cost of 38
cents per square yard, the material remaining the property of the contractor,
to be removed by him at the close of the Exposition.30,441 square yards of
this brick pavement was laid at a total cost of $11,620.77.</p>

<p>With the exception of some half dozen large trees on the Bluff tract, the
grounds were entirely barren of foliage when the landscape work was begun. 
About 1200 trees, bought from Nebraska nurseries, were planted along the
boundaries of the Kountze tract in April, 1897. These were of the rapid
growing varieties, such as the poplar and soft and elder maples.The planting
of the Bluff tract, was begun in November, 1897.It was planned to place four
rows, each 500 feet long, of large trees to shade the main avenue from the
Grand Plaza to the Horticultural Building.For this, strong healthy soft
maples, from 6 to 12 inches in diameter, were secured from the John I. Redick
farm and transplanted to the grounds. About 100 of these were transplanted
with most satisfactory and successful results.Some 200 maples, planes, elms
and Catalpas, from 6 to 8 inches in diameter and 10 to 30 feet high were
planted along the side roads and in groups.</p>

<p>The planting was resumed in the early spring of 1898 with 105 men and 20 teams. 
Trees were found in abundance on the Missouri River bottoms at no great
distance from the ExpositionGrounds and consisted of cottonwoods, planes,
mulberries, dogwoods, wild plums, birches, buckthorns, snowberry and various
other varieties.In addition vast numbers of evergreens, creepers, vines,
perennial and annual plants were transplanted to complete the conceptions of
the architect. A particularly successful feature was the planting of more than
60 large catalpa trees from 8 to 10 inches in diameter at the foot of the
terraces and as many North Carolina poplars near the Colonnades and adjacent to
the Government Building.The entire planting included 13,500 trees and bushes;
the total cost of those purchased from the nurseries was $3,766.47. About 200
Oleanders, Agaves and monumental evergreens in tubs and 85 large vases filled
with plants, were distributed around the Lagoon and Main Court.</p>

<p>More than 100,000 plants and flowers, besides thousands of vines contributed to
the floral beauties of the Exposition landscape.Geraniums, Cannas, Dahlias,
Oleanders, Lilies and Arbutus are among the most prominent varieties and many
other species were used in smaller quantities to complete the effect of the
various designs.</p>

<p>Over 700,000 square feet of ground was seeded and 14,500 yards of turf were
laid, comprising about 21 acres.The seed consisted of three fifths English
Rye and two-thirds Kentucky blue grass with a slight addition of orchard grass
and white cloverto emphasize the color.In such places as the soil was found
to be of inferior quality sod was used, at a total expense of $10,02756.</p>

<p>The greatest number of men employed by the Landscape Department at any one
time, was 210.Laborers received $1.50 per day; foreman $1.75 and $2.00 and
teams $3.50 and $4,00</p>

<p>MACHINERY AND ELECTRICITY</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>BY HENRY RUSTIN,</p>
<p>Superintendent of the Department.</p>

<p>The decorative lighting at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition as a matter of
history needs no written record to preserve it in memory.It remains in
recollection one of the most attractive features of the most successful
exposition ever held.At the start, and all through the construction period,
this particular exposition was not guilty of a big bank account, and economy in
all things was imperative.</p>

<p>The necessity for economy in the matter of lighting suggested, at first, that
only sufficient arc lights be placed to care for the ordinary conditions of
traffic at night and the immediate requirements for power among the exhibitors
and concessionaires.To this end th markets were searched for apparatus to
economically provide, approximately, 5000 H.P. in electrical energy.The
Nashville Exposition having but recently closed, it was supposed that they
would have sufficient machinery which might be obtained for use with the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition.Agents were sent from Omaha to Nashville to make
examination of the apparatus and material.After looking over their outfit it
was discovered that much of their machinery had been rented or leased and that
they had little machinery of their own for sale.After considerable dickering
between the exposition companies the Trans-Mississippi finally purchased their
outfit of steam piping and copper wire at a reasonable price.This was
promptly shipped to Omaha and the layout plans were outlined so as to include
this material in the scheme.The steam pipe purchased being of definite length
and size had to be worked into the power plant details, and necessarily, the
arrangement became one of manipulation rather than one of definite pre-arranged
scheme.For this reason the engineering accomplished in the power house
proper, was more a tribute to ingenuity than to designing, along best
mechanical engineering practices.</p>

<p>The wire purchased was also of sundry length and assorted sizes and, while
generally in good condition, needed considerable "doctoring" in order to permit
it to pass the rather stringent insurance inspection.</p>

<p>While the general installation plan was being developed attention was given to
the method of arrangement of the arc lamps about the grounds with reference to
producing as high a unit of lighting as the energy at our command would permit. 
In this development it was suggested that the entire picture formed by the
arrangement of the buildings in the grand court, probably could be illuminated
by means of small incandescent lamps with a very little greater expenditure of
energy and dollars than would be necessary in the use of arc lamps, more
particularly since the supports for arc lamps would have to be ornamental to be
in keeping with the exquisite architectural arrangement of the court, and the
incandescent lamps could be supported, in part, by the buildings themselves and
only a few cheap staff columns would be necessary for further assistance as
incandescent lighting supports to produce an evenly distributed illumination.</p>

<p>This change from the plan of arc lighting to entire incandescent lighting,
while highly desirable in theory, was so bold a departure from plans heretofore
followed in lighting that a certain misgiving was felt as to its practical
adoption.In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the incandescent lighting
scheme, temporary posts were experimentally placed in front of the Electricity
Building and incandescent lights were placed on the building itself, conforming
in part to the architecture of the building.When the lamps were actually
lighted and experiment made all doubts were removed as to its practicability. 
The results of this experiment were kept, so far as possible, from the public
in order that the novelty of the arrangement could be saved as a surprise when
th Exposition shouldbe illuminated in its entirety for the public's
criticism.</p>

<p>No area of similar extent had ever before been thus treated and even with the
buoyancy of feeling and surety of successful results demonstrated by these
experiments, it was natural that so radical a departure in lighting should be
accomplished by certainmisgivings.Nevertheless, plans were used on as if no
other arrangement had ever been considered.This arrangement of lighting
necessitated most careful developments of the plans of wiring.Those who
viewed the Trans-Mississippi illuminations must have been impressed with the
evenness of distribution, not only of the energy which became "candle power"
illumination, but must have been impressed as well with the evenness of
distribution of the lighting itself the resultant of even distribution of
electric current.</p>

<p>The organization of the Trans-Mississippi itself, as a working machine, was one
which lent itself splendidly to results.As recalled now, it is difficult to
remember any family jars or frictions due to the matter of personal equation. 
Apparently the first thing considered in each solution of a problem, when
brought before the Exposition authorities, was whether the results proposed
were the best which could be obtained; the second, whether strict economy would
permit its use as a factor in the Exposition.Probably no department of the
exposition was dealt with more liberally than the Electrical Department in this
work.It was peculiarly difficult to place before the proper committee a fair
conception of what was sought in any plan of lighting as the subject of
illumination is not easily committed to writing or placed on paper.Examples
of this difficulty were found elsewhere, even after the illuminations had been
approved by visiting crowds.It is almost amusing to pick up ones scrap book
and read the accounts then written of the illumination and find extravagant
adjective after adjective arranged in almost bewildering sequence and trying to
do their duty towards describing an effect which would not be described.</p>

<p>The organization of the Exposition was composed distinctively of level headed
business men, who could hardly be supposed to be acquainted with the details
and technical phrases of electrical work, and it is a matter of great pride to
the Electrical Department of the Trans-Mississippi to recall the confidence
which they placed in those working for them.</p>

<p>As the work developed during the pre-exposition period the different apparatus
and parts which went to make the complete total for service, were placed in
position, one part after another.Sometimes great anxiety was felt when
necessary machinery did not arrive on the expected date, but the assistance of
some limb of Department of th Exposition, was called into requisition to
assist, and invariably the material was found and brought out in the nick of
time.When the opening day finally came around, we were almost afraid to
breathe; the different machines were started up, one after another, some for
their initial run, and as the lights gradually came up from no candle power to
full brilliancy, words or actions failed to express the relief in seeingan
actual working almost living, success.The cheer which the first night crowd
gave as the lights gradually came to full brilliancy, meant more to me than any
other occasion in my life. It seemed as though all efforts, hopes, fears and
realization were all crowded into one exultant moment.The operation of such a
plant and the necessity for keeping it up to its initial successful condition,
would not permit remaining in simply an exultant mood.The details of
maintenance required a conscientious and attentive organization and such
fortunately, could be selected from the working force which had constructed the
wiring and machinery plant.Of necessity this force was kept down to a small
number, barely one-eighth of those used in construction work were retained for
the operative period.</p>

<p>The power plant equipment consisted of:</p>

<p>4,500 H.P. Climax Boilers.</p>
<p>2,250 H.P. Climax Boilers,</p>
<p>1,10"x6"x10" Marsh Feed Pump.</p>
<p>1,10"x6"x10" Dean Duplex Reed Pump.</p>
<p>1,7-1/2"x5"x6" Worthington Feed Pump.</p>
<p>3,Westinghouse Compound Engines,</p>
<p>1,Buffalo Forge Engine,</p>
<p>1,Murray Iron Works Engine.</p>
<p>1,Hamilton Corliss Engine.</p>

<p>In all about 2,000 available engine horse power.These engines drove General
Electric Co.'s generators, alternating and direct current, sufficient to take
care of, approximately 15000 - 8 candle power incandescent lamps and 400 arcs
and 300 HP. in direct current motors.</p>

<p>The performance of this plant, under the circumstances was very creditable. 
While there was no provision made for feed water heaters, economizers, or like
devices, in the scheme of the plant, the coal consumption never exceeded 17
pounds per kilo-watt hour.That is to say, one pound of coal would "run" two
of our incandescent lamps for one hour.The total cost of operating the power
plant, including labor and all expenses, never exceeded $.44 per kilo-watt
hour, or, stated in another way, the current for 1000 of our lamps cost $1.32
per hour when considering the expenses at the power house. Bear in mind,
however, that steam had to be maintained under most of the boilers, day and
night, while the greater part of the electrical energy was used but four hours
a night.The plant would run to its utmost capacity for four hours and it is
probable that the coal consumption, and hence the total expense, could have
been reduced, could these conditions have been regulated. But for the purpose
and for the period of six months this installation served its purpose
admirably.</p>

<p>A radical departure from former Exposition methods was made in the plan of
operation of machinery in the main Exhibit Buildings.Heretofore it had seemed
essential that all machinery be operated from countershafts by means of
belting.More than frequently an intermediate system of shafting was necessary
in order to arrive at a proper speed.It was customary that the Exposition
should install and maintain this shafting and necessary supports at its own
expense while the user of power supplied belts, pulleys and the like at his own
expense.At the Trans-Mississippi Exposition all wheels in motion were
operated by individual motors, supplied by the user of power, while the
Exposition brought electrical energy to convenient points within the building. 
Thus the Exposition was saved a considerable expenditure for shafting and
supports, and, at the same time, the whole equipment was in keeping with modern
practice and the exhibitor was put to no greater expense than with the
countershafting plan.</p>

<p>The individual motor plan of operating machinery had a further advantage.It
was impossible to discover from the exhibitor just how much power he would
require.He did not know definitely and his approximation was persistently
elastic; it was somewhere between limits not stated.The individual motor plan
permitted a postponement of the date of decision as all the Exposition had to
do was to furnish current and the quantity and quality desired, which it could
do on a day's notice any time.The counter-shaft plan at one of the earlier
Expositions, brought it about, that after three hundred feet of 4 inch steel
counter shafting with hangers and supports had been placed, and moreover a 500
horse power engine had been installed to run the shaft, it was found that there
was required from this shafting only that power necessary to operate three
sewing machines.The consumer using the greatest amount of power was the
Westinghouse Company in the Machinery &amp; Electricity Bldg.This company had a
number of motors in service running electric generators and besides a number of
interesting experimental coils and transformers, with which they kept the
visiting public entertained.</p>

<p>The Government Building's demands for power were the most continuous and
exacting of any customer we had to serve.It was essential to maintain
electrical energy at two of their motor stations for 4500 consecutive hours. 
This was done successfully but not without effort as, aside from power house
difficulties, we had a pole line to maintain against Nebraska zephyrs.</p>

<p>To sum up the machinery and electricity of the Exposition, it is fair to say
that no startling novelties or innovations in apparatus, either prime movers,
generators or auxiliary came to our assistance to entertain the public.The
nearest approach to an electrical novelty was the X Ray machine in the General
Electric Company's exhibit, although this device was then becoming well known
to the public.We were compelled to rely on standard apparatus to produce any
"coups" which might occur to us as practicable.So resort was had to standard
incandescent lamps and reliance placed on our ability to arrange them for a
picture setting; an accomplishment at night to the gem arrangement of the
buildings about the grand lagoon.</p>

<p>It was a most successful illumination and commanded the admiration of all who
witnessed it.</p>

<p>The cost of machinery and electricity to the Exposition, summarized as shown in
statements elsewhere, was</p>

<p>Electrical Department,........................ $63,282.85</p>
<p>Machinery ".........................53,945.52</p>
<p>Power Plant in Transportation Building,.......2,045.44</p>
<p>Total cost,...............$119,273.81</p>
<p>Revenues from supply of power and lights...... $28,550.96</p>
<p>Net cost to Exposition 90,722.85</p>

<p>This does not include revenue from sale or power and light properties at close
of Exposition, but as all Exposition assets of physical character were sold in
bulk, it is not possible to apportion the proceeds.The materials of this
department should easily have realized $10,000.00 as they included three
Westinghouse compound engines which cost $8500.00 from a thousand and one other
items of property.</p>

<p>WATER---SYSTEM</p>

<p>A complete system of water pipes were laid throughout the grounds, carrying an
ample supply to all the buildings, fountains, hydrants and sanitary kiosks and
to also provide for the complete sprinkling of the flower beds, grass, etc. 
The supply of water was received from the 36 inch main from the pumping station
at Florence.The water was purchased from the Omaha Water Company.The amount
of water used, pressure, price, etc., is shown by the following statement.</p>

<p>Consumption in September,.................................40,064,425</p>
<p>Consumption in October,...................................37,833,652</p>

<p>Water pressure 100 lbs to 106-1/2 gallons.</p>

<p>Exposition paid 5 cents per thousand gallons of water used June 1st to November
1st.</p>

<p>Water used prior to June 1st was supplied gratis.</p>

<p>Exposition paid one-half cost of water meters.</p>

<p>Lagoon covered 7-1/2 acres and required 13,800,000 gallons to 
fill it.</p>


<p>FIRE -- PROTECTION.</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>Great care was shown in the planning and installation of the apparatus for the
protection of Buildings, Exhibits, Concessions, etc.Two fire houses were
provided, one near north end of "Bluffs tract" one on 20th Street at Manderson
Street.The Exposition purchased Seagraves &amp; Co.?, Columbus, Ohio, one hook
and ladder truck $900.00 and two hose wagons at $300 each, all of their best
product and latest design, also 8000 feet single jacket rubber hose, at 28-1/2
cents per foot for stations in buildings and 1600 feet test brand carbolized
fire hose at 90 cents perft. less 20% from the New York Belting and Packing
Co.In addition to this equipment, the city of Omaha installed one chemical
apparatus and one hose wagon, so that the equipment for fighting fires was
reasonably complete.The city of Omaha detailed men from the city fire
department to be in charge and handle the apparatus.The city paid their
salaries, the Exposition paying operating and maintenance expenses.</p>

<p>LOSSES BY FIRE</p>

<p>There were 25 alarms for fires, during the period of the
Exposition.Losses were as follows:</p>

<p>On Buildings,...................................... $4,225.00</p>
<p>On contents,.......................................1,865.00</p>
<p>6,090.00</p>
<p>Insured for,.......................................3,000.00</p>
<p>Lossuninsured,................................... $3,090.00</p>

<p>The losses were in fires at California Gold Mining Tunnel on June 3rd and when
the "Mt Nebo Chapel" at Old Plantation concession was completely destroyed
on July 10.</p>

<p>INSURANCE</p>

<p>The fire insurance companies maintained that a high rate for insurance against
fire losses, must necessarily be charged on account of great moral as well as
physical hazard incurred by insurance of property of this character,
notwithstanding the fact, that, despite their arguments, no serious losses by
fire had occurred at any of the previous large expositions.</p>

<p>The management being guardians for large interests, believed that they should
carry a reasonable amount of insurance andarranged with the insurance
representatives for insurance on the following basis.Blanket insurance form,
giving list and value of all buildings (Except statuary on same), values
aggregating $300,000.00.70%Co-Insurance clause in policies, 10%
depreciation agreed upon.Rate of insurance 2-1/2% Period of time covered by
the insurance as follows:</p>

<p>"It is hereby understood and mutually agreed upon that one-sixth of the amount
insured by this policy shall terminate at noon on the 30th day of June, 1898;
one-sixth on the 31st day of July, 1898; one-sixth on the 31st day of August,
1898; one-sixth on the 30th day of September, 1898 and one-sixthon the 31st
day of October, 1898;after which last named date, at noon, the remaining
one-sixth shall continue in force until the date of expiration named in this
policy, namely"November 20th, 1898; but in the event of the cancellation of
this policy by the assured before its expiration no claim for return premium
shall be made."</p>

<p>EMERGENCY HOSPITAL</p>

<p>The Emergency Hospital was a fine modern cottage, remodeled for the purpose
with a wing added for an operating room.It was supplied with a modern
ambulance and with complete hospital furnishings and instruments.A corps of
physicians and trained nurses were always on duty, ready for instant service. 
There were upwards of 3,000 cases treated of character, cost, etc. as follows:</p>

<p>F. P. Kirkendall, Esq.</p>

<p>Manager Department of Buildings &amp; Grounds.</p>

<p>Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the organization and operation
of the exposition guard force under my command.</p>

<p>I was appointed commandant of the force May 26, 1898, by yourself under
authority granted by the executive committee and assumed the duties of the
office May 27th.</p>

<p>A large number of applications previously received by you were turned over to
me and I afterwards received a number of additional applications.All
candidates for appointment were required to appear before me and to produce
recommendations as to their character and fitness for the position.</p>

<p>The duties of the guards were to preserve order, to give information to
Exposition patrons, see to the observance of Exposition rules by all persons
upon the grounds, look to the prompt care of any injured or sick persons, etc.,
etc., as provided in a voluminous set of rules for Guidance of Guards, supplied
to me by the Executive Committee through you as manager of the Department.</p>

<p>The salaries of the guard force were fixed by the Executive Committee as
follows:Commandant $150; captain $75; First Lieutenant $65; Second Lieutenant
$60; sergeants $50; Corporals $45; privates $40, all members of the force being
required to furnish their own subsistence and a regulation uniform, consisting
of helmet, navy blue blouse and trousers, the latter having a white stripe on 
the outside seam.Rank was indicated by shoulder straps and chevrons,
following U.S. infantry regulations.</p>

<p>Members of the force were selected solely upon the recommendation and
endorsement of reputable citizens as to their integrity and fitness.The
personnel of the force at organization was as follows:</p>

<p>C.E. Llewellyn,Commandant</p>
<p>M. Covell,Captain.</p>

<p>J. Stebbins,1st Lieutenant.</p>
<p>John Regan2nd Lieutenant.</p>

<p>W. Norwood, 1st Sergeant.</p>
<p>J. Hanks, Sergeant.</p>
<p>G. L. Martin"</p>
<p>J. Murphy"</p>
<p>Jos. Hinton"</p>
<p>W. Carder"</p>
<p>G. T. Young"</p>

<p>M. J. Metcalf Corporal.</p>
<p>G. L. Treynor "</p>
<p>C. C. Northrup"</p>
<p>George Kay "</p>

<p>E. E. Brand Clerk</p>
<p>Bonnie Gans Stenographer.</p>

<p>About sixty privates.</p>

<p>As the occasion arose for increasing the force additions were made until 304
names were on the roll, but no more than 237 were ever on duty at one time. 
The average number of guards on duty was about 160.During the period of the
Exposition about forty men were discharged for cause.A brief summary of the
work accomplished by the guard force follows:</p>

<p>Arrests for misdemeanors,----------------------------- 239.</p>
<p>Sent to city jail and prosecuted,--------------------- 129</p>
<p>Detained at Guard house and expelled from Grounds,---- 110</p>

<p>A very large number of articles lost by visitors to the grounds were brought to
the "Lost and Found Bureau"* at guard headquarters and many were returned to
the owners upon proper identification.The remainder, together with a record
book of the same, were turned over by me to the Superintendent of the Buildings
&amp; Grounds Department, November 1st at the termination of my services as
Commandant of the Guard.</p>

<p>Thanking you and your associates in the Exposition management for the many
courtesies shown me during my services with the Exposition, I am</p>

<p>Yours respectfully.</p>

<p>C. E. LLEWELLYN,</p>

<p>Commandant.</p>

<p>*LOST AND FOUND BUREAU.</p>

<p>In all large gathering gatherings of people it happens from a variety of
causes, that many articles of value are lost by their owners, straps, parasols,
umbrellas, Pocketbooks, Rolls of Money, Watches and Jewelry, finger rings,
spectacles, eye-glasses, walking sticks, admission passes and a multitude of
other articles, and where such gatherings continue daily for a long period, a
watchful care over the interests of patrons requires an organization to care
for such articles and endeavor to again put them in the possession of their
owners.</p>

<p>Such an organization was perfected through the guard service.A Lost and Found
Office was established at Guards Headquarters and thousands of these articles
were found, listed and examined and in most cases sent to the owners.After
the close of the Exposition several hundred articles, not claimed were
advertised and sold and the proceeds turned into the Treasury of the
Exposition.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF EXHIBITS.</p>

<p>EDWARD E. BRUCE, Manager.</p>

<p>H. B. Hardt, Assistant.</p>

<p>The Exhibits, of all form, nature and character, are calculated to be the main
attraction of an Exposition, and hence much thought, care and attention is
necessary that the exhibits, whether considered singly or as a whole, shall be
of such character as to not only compel the attention of the visitors but to
enlist their interest in the qualities, nature and operation of them, so it
follows that the most successful exhibits are those which most generally
attracts the sympathy and inquiry of the exposition patrons.</p>

<p>It is a matter of much pride to the exposition management, that the exhibits as
secured, arranged and grouped, excited so much favorable commendation from
those whose long and varied experience in exposition work, qualified them as
competent judges in such matters.</p>

<p>It is but fair to state that the general high quality of the exhibits in this
exposition is due mainly to Manager Bruce of the department, and to his able
assistant, Mr. Hardt; and is also due to the general high character and
efficiency of the superintendents of the various branches of this department,
selected by Manager Bruce for their special qualifications and fitness for the
work placed in their charge.</p>

<p>To the fine business ability and the excellent judgment evidenced by the
manager of this department is attributed, mainly the results obtained.</p>

<p>The operations and results of this department, in so far as they can be given
at this late day, may be stated in the following way.</p>

<p>The first thought of the department management was given to its organization
and to preparation of rules governing exhibits and exhibitors.To this end
Manager Bruce, Manager Reed and the general secretary, as a committee carefully
considered the subject of rules and form of application etc., noting the action
of similar projects and considering their fitness in this case.As a result of
the committee's consideration and conclusions on the subject the following
Rules were recommended and were by them adopted.</p>

<p>(Insert General Rules and Regulations 7 pages typewritten, next attached.)</p>

<p>Manager Bruce divided the work of the Exhibits Department into branches,
designated Bureaus, as follows:</p>

<p>Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>Bureau of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>Bureau of Mines and Mining.</p>
<p>Bureau of Agriculture, Horticulture, Forestry and Irrigation.</p>
<p>Bureau of Live Stock.</p>
<p>Bureau of Diary Products.</p>
<p>Bureau of Poultry.</p>
<p>Bureau of Bee Industries.</p>
<p>Bureau of Machinery and Electricity.</p>
<p>Bureau of Manufactures and International Exhibits.</p>
<p>Bureau of Liberal Arts</p>
<p>Bureau of Transportation and Agricultural Implements.</p>

<p>The operations under these various bureaus, as gathered from reports of chief
of bureaus, from observation and from the general records are outlined in the
following divisions.</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>The Woman's Club of Omaha, deeply interested in the Exposition, desired that
woman should have charge of some distinctive branch of the work, and aid in the
general plan, and on February 2nd, 1897, Mrs. Z.T. Lindsey and Mrs. W.P.
Harford, as a committee from the Woman's Club met with the Executive Committee
to consider the subject and plan for woman's participation.After a second
meeting a plan was agreed upon as follows.</p>

<p>PLAN OF ORGANIZATION.</p>

<div class="milestone horbar"> </div>

<p>Section 1.That the women be given charge of the Bureau of Education in it
various branches, Viz:</p>

<p>The exhibits of the work of public school, kindergartens, manual training and
industrial schools, schools for the deaf, blind and feeble minded, art schools,
reform schools and all schools of special instruction, and that they also have
charge of a series of Congresses on various scientific and philosophical lines
during the months from June to November 1898.</p>

<p>Section 2.That this Bureau of Education be in the hands and under control of
a Board of Managers of twenty-seven (27) in number, as more particularly
specified in Section II, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of
the Exposition; eleven (11) of said managers shall be chosen from Omaha, two
(2) from South Omaha, two (2) from Council Bluffs and twelve (12) from Nebraska
outside of Omaha and South Omaha.</p>

<p>Section 3.That the local members of the Board of Managers be elected at a
mass meeting of the woman of Omaha, that the members from South Omaha and
Council Bluffs shall be elected at a mass meeting of the women in said cities,
called for that purpose, each of said meetings to be called by the secretary of
this Board to be held in said cities on Saturday February 13th, 1897, at 2
o'clock P.M.</p>

<p>Section 4.That from each Congressional District in the state, two (2) members
of the Board of Managers shall be elected at a mass meeting of the woman of
each district, for that purpose.</p>

<p>Section 5.That the Congressmen from each Congressional District shall
designate where the said mass meeting shall be held and, if desired by the
women of said district, the Board of Directors of the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition will send a woman from Omaha to said district to fully
explain the ends and aims of the Exposition.</p>

<p>Section 6.That the said Board of Managers may elect its own officers and
adopt rules governing its actions.</p>

<p>Section 7.That two (2) women from each state outside of Nebraska, be selected
to form an Advisory Council, auxiliary to the Board of Managers.</p>

<p>Section 8.That the Advisory Council be selected by the Board of Managers from
names suggested to the Board by the different State Federations of Clubs and
other educational organizations.</p>

<p>Section 9.That the members of the Board of Managers and of the Advisory
Council do not receive remuneration.</p>

<p>Section 10.That in the work of the various departments and committees of the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, where the services of women
would be valuable, that they be asked to render such service.</p>

<p>Section 11.The powers of said Board of Managers shall be complete for the
purposes above outlined, subject, however, to the approval of the Executive
Committee of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, and to provide
for this approval the Secretary of the said Board of Managers shall transmit a
report of the proceedings of their meetings to the Secretary of the Exposition,
who shall thereupon lay the same before the Executive Committee for their
approval.</p>

<p>Mr. E.E. Bruce,
Manager Dep't of Exhibits,
Trans-Mississippi &amp; Int. Exposition.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I beg leave to submit herewith the report of the Bureau of Education, Dep't. of
Exhibits.</p>

<p>The operation of the plan of organization resulted in the selection of the
Board of Managers as first given above.</p>

<p>The resignation of Mrs. McIntosh from the Board, was accepted and Mrs. N. P.
Feil was elected to fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>An Advisory Council, as provided in the plan of organization, was appointed
early in the summer of 1897, but it was found to be an adjunct of no very
practical importance.Acknowledgments are due, however, to Mrs. Alice Babb of
Iowa, Mrs. C.L. Scott and Mrs. M.G. Slocum, Mrs. T.K. Gray and Mrs. Carrie L.
Backus of Minnesota, Mrs. Emory of Montana, Mrs. James Baird of Texas and Mrs.
Ellen M. Henrotin of Illinois.</p>

<p>WORK OF THE BUREAU</p>

<p>The work delegated to the Bureau has been conducted under four general
divisions, viz:</p>

<p>Educational Exhibits,</p>

<p>Collective.</p>

<p>Individual.</p>

<p>Women's Work.</p>

<p>Congresses.</p>

<p>Girls' and Boys' Building.</p>

<p>There will be reported seriatim.</p>

<p>EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS</p>

<p>Collective</p>

<p>The work of securing educational exhibits was found to be more difficult than
had been expected, owing, probably to two reasons.</p>
<p>First, experience in former expositions had demonstrated to teachers that the
work of preparing educational exhibits of value, was great, while the interest
of the public in that class of exhibits was small.</p>

<p>Second, the charge for space was unfavorable to exhibits having no commercial
value, and as this was a new feature in our exposition, the objection to it
from educational institutions, was loud and deep.Nearly all such institutions
were solicited, however, by correspondence and in many cases personally or by
delegation, and exhibits were secured from Columbia University, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California and from
several business colleges.Special mention should also be made of a collection
from the Chicago Art Institute.The largest collective exhibits were made by
state institutions and paid for from state appropriations.The exhibit made by
Nebraska included the public schools from Kindergarten to university and every
institution for dependent or defective classes as well.Colorado made a
similar exhibit.Kansas displayed work from grades below university.Missouri
emphasized original work from university students and that done in schools for
the Negro, the latter notably from the industrial standpoint.Oregon, Montana
and Los Angeles Co., California, made representative exhibits.As an extra
incentive, the Bureau gave, in addition to the exposition award a special
diploma to the best state exhibit, to ten of the best county exhibits, and to
the best exhibit from each of the thirty-two classes, including various grades,
special schools and institutions for dependent and defective classes.The
number of these awards was thirty-three.</p>

<p>The manual training exhibit from the Omaha High School in active operation, in
charge of Mr. John Wigman, Professor of Manual Training, was of special
interest and drew much attention to it.A fine exhibit of Ceramic products
from Colorado and Nebraska was greatly admired, and interested many patrons.</p>

<p>INDIVIDUAL</p>

<p>In order to give pupils whose schools were not exhibiting, an opportunity to
present their work, a plan was devised for individual competition in
composition, history, penmanship, nature study, drawing and manual training.A
premium list arranged by a committee consisting of Mrs. Sawyer, Mrs. Keysor and
Mrs. Reed, was printed in pamphlet form and distributed in schools and
teacher's institutes and through the correspondence of state and county
officials.Members of the Board presented the plan in their various localities
at teacher's meetings, and to individual teaches, and the secretary
supplemented their efforts by a systematic correspondence with school
officials, but the scheme failed to incite interest, and the exhibits were few
in number, and for the most part inferior in quality.The number submitted in
each subject is as follows:</p>
<p>Drawing128</p>
<p>Penmanship98</p>
<p>Composition 68</p>
<p>Manual Training21</p>
<p>History12</p>
<p>Nature Study 3</p>
<p>Total 320</p>

<p>An entry fee of 25 cents has been charged and gold, silver, and bronze medals
had been promised as awards, but since the whole number of entries was less
than the number of medals required to meet the provisions of the premium list,
the committee decided to refund the entry fee and to give a diploma to exhibits
of merit.This diploma is a facsimile of the exposition diploma, except that
it is much smaller.About 200 awards have been made. </p>

<p>CONGRESSES</p>

<p>There was no branch of work entrusted to the Bureau which was accepted with so
much enthusiasm as that given to congress work.Having been inaugurated at the
organization of the Bureau, it was conducted through the preliminary stages by
the Executive Committee and turned over Sept. 2nd, 1897 to a congress committee
consisting of Mrs. Keysor, Mrs. Sawyer and Mrs. Reed.A little later Mrs. Feil
was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mrs. Keysor, and
Mrs. W.H. Hanchett and Mrs. T.K. Sudborough were added to the committee.These
ladies served until July 9th, 1898 when the resignation of Mrs. Feil and Mrs.
Hanchett were accepted and Mrs. Towne and Mrs. Martin were appointed to fill
the vacancies.The organization of the congresses included a committee of
arrangements and a local committee, the former to have the planning of the
program, and them latter to be a committee of ways and means.Both these
committees were appointed by the congress committee, which was successful in
securing the services of experts as chairman in every case.The congresses
were, however, planned with great difficulty, owing to the fact that it was
impossible to secure when a provisional appropriation from the exposition as a
whole, or for any one of them in particular, and also, because favors shown to
certain congresses were denied to others.these conditions were responsible
for the loss of several congresses for which plans had been formulated and
considerable work done.Among such congresses were those of labor, temperance,
social economics, literature and Trans-Mississippi history.The congress of
Christian Activities was also dropped on account of the removal from the city
of the chairman when it was too late to supply his place.The abandonment of
this congress which had been planned with sufficient breadth to include all
form of religious work, was a distinct loss, but it was compensated for by
several other congresses, as none below.</p>

<p>A R T. -- Chairman, Mr. Lorado Taft, Chicago.</p>
<p>Local Chairman, Mr. Paul Charlton.</p>

<p>This congress occupied the greater part of three days and comprised six
sessions.The programs consisted in the main, of illustrated lectures on art
topics, which were given by some of the best known critics and artists in the
west.</p>

<p>MUSIC. -- Chairman, Mr. Homer Moore, Omaha.</p>
<p>Local Chairman, Mr. Martin Cahn.</p>

<p>Twelve sessions extending over four days were held and the programs contained
the names of over thirty musical artists and composers.Indian music day was
one of the features of this congress, and on that occasion Miss Alice Fletcher
of Harvard University, Mr. Francis LaFlesche of Washington and Prof. J. H.
Filmore of Pomona, California, gave the results of original investigations
among the American aborigines, while a group of Omaha Indian illustrated their
addresses by native songs.American Music day gave opportunity for the
presentation of American music and the discussion of its possibilities.Wagner
day was devoted to the music and the theories of Richard Wagner, and the
program included a discussion of his works illustrated by the stereopticon. 
The musical congress, planned on a large scale, was accordingly expensive,
although the artists participating, made no charge for their services,
requiring only that expenses be paid.The orchestra was also a heavy item of
expense, and the action of the exposition in making orchestral concerts free to
exposition visitors, destroyed the commercial value of the orchestra on which
the congress had counted when contract was made.Railroad transportation
proportionate to that given other congresses, was not provided, and street
entrance to the auditorium though granted in other cases was denied in this. 
It happened therefore, that while the congress was able to pay the Exposition
$850.00 on its contract for the orchestra, it was unable to meet many of its
bills from artists participating in the programs.The deficit, however, having
been met by the exposition, is more than covered by the surplus from the Girls
and boys' building fund, which has been left with the Exposition.</p>

<p>MONETARY. -- Chairman, Hon. J. Sterling Morton, Neb. City
Local Chairman, Dr. Geo. L. Miller.</p>

<p>This congress occupied three days and held five sessions.It was participated
in by many of the foremost financiers of the Unites States, and the papers
presented constitute an important contribution to monetary science.</p>

<p>SINGLE TAX. -- Chairman, Mr. Louis D. Post, Chicago
Local Chairman, Mr. W. D. Becket.</p>

<p>Six sessions occupied two days.The programs represented some of the best
known exponents of the single tax theory.</p>

<p>RELIGION. -- Chairman, Rev. Jenkin Lloyd, Chicago.</p>
<p>Local Chairman, Mr. Thomas Kilpatrick.</p>

<p>The Liberal Congress of Religion covered four days and held nine sessions.Its
programs were of broad and general interests, and such representative men as
Dr. Thomas, Dr. Barrows and Rabbi Hirsch of Chicago, President David Starr
Jordan of Leland Standford and Prof. Hanford Henderson of Brooklyn, were heard. 
This was the most largely attended of all the congresses.</p>

<p>The Women's congresses included the following:</p>

<p>NATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN. -- Chairman, Mrs. May Wright Sewall,
Indianapolis</p>
<p>Local Chairman, Miss Mary Fairbrother.</p>
<p>Five days, ten sessions.</p>

<p>TRANS-MISSISSIPPI CONGRESS OF WOMEN'S CLUBS. --</p>
<p>Chairman, Mrs. Belle M. Stoutenborough, 
Plattsmouth Local Chairman, Mrs. Philip Potter.</p>
<p>Three days, eight sessions.</p>

<p>SUFFRAGE DAY. -- Chairman, Miss Susan B. Anthony, New York.</p>
<p>Local Chairman, Mrs. Cornish.</p>
<p>One day, two sessions.</p>

<p>W.C.T.U. DAY. -- Chairman, Mrs. S. T. Walker, Lincoln.</p>
<p>Local Chairman, Mrs. M. G. Andrews.</p>
<p>One session.</p>

<p>MOTHER'S CONGRESS. -- Chairman, Mrs. Theo. Birney, Washington.</p>
<p>Local Chairman, Mrs. H. H. Heller.</p>
<p>Two days, five sessions.</p>

<p>JEWISH COUNCIL OF WOMEN. -- Chairman, Mrs. H. J. Solomon, Chicago.</p>
<p>Local Chairman, Mrs. A. Polack.</p>
<p>Two days, six sessions.</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Teacher's Convention, the Library Congress and Congress
of Charities and Corrections were carried on under other auspices, but much
clerical work and all of the circularizing was done at the secretary's office.</p>

<p>The Omaha Woman's Club as its gift to the congresses furnished a suitable
meeting place in its club rooms in the First Congregational Church.Several
conventions not under the auspices of the Bureau were held there.The entire
number of sessions for which the club provided being 103.</p>

<p>GIRLS' AND BOYS' BUILDING</p>
<p>Preliminary.</p>

<p>There was no building on the exposition grounds in which so many persons were
interested as that devoted to boys and girls.Plans suggested at a meeting of
the Executive Committee of the Bureau June 5th, 1897, and formulated on June
17th were immediately approved by the exposition, and were laid before the
Board of Managers at its meeting of July 1st.It was decided to raise funds as
far as possible from school children and a descriptive leaflet was circulated
among the teachers of Nebraska and neighboring states as they assembled during
the summer in county institutes.This method served to introduce the project
and early in the fall a definite canvass was undertaken by local patronesses
who collected the school contributions in their respective towns.About a
hundred such workers were enlisted.</p>

<p>Three special incentives were offered to individuals and schools contributing
to the building fund.</p>

<p>First, A certificate showing a picture of the building was offered to all
contributors of one dollar or more.A design submitted by Miss Lydia McCague
was chosen for these certificates, and 1737 of them have been awarded.</p>

<p>Second, The name of individuals, towns and schools contributing ten dollars or
more were promised a place of honor on the honor roll.This roll of honor was
exhibited in the hall of the building.</p>

<p>Third, It was agreed that the pictures decorating the building should be
awarded at the close of the exposition to the schools making the largest
contribution per capita one-half to be given to rural schools.At the
solicitation of Mrs. W. W. Keysor, gifts of pictures to the number of thirty
one were made by the following:</p>

<p>Braun Clement Co. New York.</p>
<p>Berlin Photo Co. New York.</p>
<p>Hanfstanxel Co. New York.</p>
<p>Prang Educational Co. Boston.</p>
<p>Elson &amp; Co. Boston.</p>
<p>Soule Photo Co. Boston.</p>
<p>Miss Sarah McSheahe, Omaha.</p>

<p>One of these pictures, being deemed unsuitable for school use, was given to the
Omaha Public Library, and the remaining thirty were divided between rural and
other schools.</p>

<p>Desiring to extend the award of pictures still further the Board purchased, at
the close of the Exposition, nineteen additional ones, and these have been
given for the most part, to village schools.</p>

<p>In February a single edition of a boys' and girls' newspaper known as "The
Hatchett" was issued and sold for the benefit of the building fund.The net
receipts of this venture were about six hundred dollars.</p>

<p>RESULTS.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the executive committee, March 18th, the architect, stated that
in order to complete the building by June 1st it would be necessary to begin at
once, and the secretary reported the funds on hand as insufficient to meet the
architects estimate.In this dilemma the committee asked for credit from the
exposition, which was granted, and the building was immediately begun.It was
completed June 15th and was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on the 4th of
July.</p>

<p>Among the features of this building was the creche, operated under the
jurisdiction of the Bureau, and conducted by Mrs. A. Moore and five assistants. 
Upwards of 2,000 children were cared for here while their parents viewed the
exposition and the institution after the first month became somewhat more than
self supporting.</p>

<p>"The International Doll Collection" sent from Boston and exhibited by Miss
Arabel Kimball for the benefit of the Omaha creche, and the "Model School Room"
presented by the Prang Educational Co. were important exhibits, and the
restaurant operated in the upper gallery by Mrs. Geo. Tilden was the most
fruitful source of income.Besides the above there were thirteen exhibits and
concessions in the building, exclusive of the children's exhibits and which was
displayed upon the walls and in the reading room.The hall was used daily for
cooking lectures and four children's entertainments were given there.It was
also the rendezvous for eleven children's excursions and was in constant use
with the reception and toilet rooms, as a place of public comfort.</p>

<p>The committees connected with the building were,</p>

<p>BUILDING COMMITTEE,</p>

<p>Mrs. T. L. Kimball.</p>
<p>Mrs. A. Monroe.</p>
<p>Mrs. E. A. Cudahy.</p>

<p>PICTURE COMMITTEE,</p>

<p>Mrs. W. W. Keysor.</p>
<p>Mrs. J. B. Crabtree.</p>
<p>Mrs. E. M. Reed.</p>

<p>The surplus of receipts over expenditures was $937.82, which by action of the
executive committee, was given to the exposition.</p>

<p>WOMAN'S WORK.</p>

<p>By request of the Department of Exhibits, the Bureau, immediately after its
organization undertook the charge of a class of exhibits known as Woman's Work. 
It was understood, however, that such exhibits were not to be placed apart as
had been the case in other expositions and that there was to be no
classification as regards sex.The work of women was therefore to be found in
all the exhibit buildings, and this report will be concerned with those
exhibits only for which the Bureau of Education is directly responsible.There
were two working exhibits of foods and household utensils conducted by Mrs. Mac
Murphy in the Agricultural Building and one by Miss Ranche in the Boys and
Girls Building.These included daily demonstration lectures, which were well
attended.The exhibits of art needle work and ceramics was placed in the
Liberal Arts Building, and special mention is due the Nebraska Ceramic Club for
an attractive showing of hand painted china.</p>

<p>The Colorado women made a fine display of art needlework and ceramics, and the
booth occupied by the Missouri woman contained a similar exhibit.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Nebraska Federation of Women's Clubs contained club
literature and programs and thus served as an exponent of women's work of a
different kind.</p>

<p>All these booths were furnished in a manner that made them attractive as rest
places, but their location in a gallery was unfortunate.</p>

<p>Ceramic art and needlework have heretofore enjoyed similar advantages to those
given fine arts, but here a radical distinction was made, and while fine arts
was given free space on the ground floor, with all expenses paid, ceramic art
was obliged to pay for space in a gallery and furnish its own fittings.This
fact was invariably stated by artists when declining to exhibit, and to it is
undoubtedly due the failure to secure a representative exhibit of china
painting.</p>

<p>In concluding this report it is proper to say that the work of the Bureau of
Education differed from that of other divisions, in that it had to do with
non-commercial and somewhat intangible matters.The Girls and Boys' building
had a success which may be measured in terms of dollars and cents, but woman's
work, congresses and Educational exhibits cannot be judged from a material
standpoint.We trust therefore that whatever approval be given us in your mind
will rest upon the fact that we helped to make the exposition symmetrical and
dignified.</p>

<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>

<p>Frances M. Ford,
Secretary Bureau of Education.</p>

<p>Mr. E. E. Bruce,</p>
<p>Chairman &amp; Mgr. of Deps of Exhibits.</p>
<p>Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>As Supt. of the Fine Arts Department of the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International
Exposition, I beg to submit the following report.</p>

<p>When in the month of July, 1897, your executive committee so kindly appointed
me to the position which I held during your successful exposition, I
immediately realized that under existing circumstances, Omaha being so very far
from the general art centers, that it would be extremely difficult to interest
and secure the co-operation of the artists, art societies and the various
organizations which I felt we would be able to rely on for the collection; I
suggested to you that in the place of the old manner of giving medals, awards
and prizes that the exposition management guarantee the sale and purchase of
pictures to the extent of $5,000.I believe then that it was by far the
wisest, and in fact, the only plan by which we could hope to secure a
representative exhibition, and now, as I look back over the work, I am more
than ever satisfied that that was the only plan and I feel gratified and
complimented to learn that it is being adopted by other exhibitions all over
the country.I further realized that your exhibition, particularly in the
lines of art, would have to be of a different nature from that usually held in
the more densely populated and older sections of our country, and while some of
the plans did not wholly succeed, the general success of this department is one
of which I am quite pleased.</p>

<p>The work of publicity was of the first importance, and this was largely secured
through circulars sent to the various art societies and to the prominent
artists over the country.A number of personal visits to the cities of the
East and to various exhibitions, secured for the exhibition wide public notice,
but required considerable personal effort and a visit to many of the studios
resulted finally in awakening the interest and cooperation of the right person. 
Fortunately the exhibition came at the time of the year when many pictures
could be secured out of the winter and spring exhibitions.In this way we
secured an important collection by Scotch artists and the great painting of
Charles the Bold by Boybet, from the St. Louis Exposition.This required an
unusual amount of red tape and correspondence, both by reason of their being
foreign pictures and the fact that they had been sent to this country for one
exhibition only, and further that the artists objected to having their work
boxed up and out of sight for six months or more.This objection was overcome
by sending some of the pictures to the Detroit Museum of Art and to the Chicago
Art Institute for exhibition, during the winter.Thus making of these two
points a sort of rallying ground as it were.From here they were finally sent
to Omaha.A number of pictures were secured from the exposition at Nashville
under the same circumstances.</p>

<p>When I arrived on the grounds in May, I found that the building was far from
being ready for me, but this was to be expected as it occurs at almost every
exposition.However, the workmen made every effort to clear the way, and while
we were very greatly delayed, I take opportunity in calling your attention to
the fact, that aside from the Government Building, the Art Building was the
only one on the grounds completely ready for visitors on opening day.</p>

<p>In all some 700 pieces were hung on the walls, many of them loaned by art
institutions and from the collections of private individuals.This gave the
people who visited the exposition an opportunity to compare the work that had
stood the test of time with that of the modern artists, and while many people
did not understand and failed to appreciate the opportunities given them in the
shape of a great exhibition, it was the universal verdict of those people who
had made art a study even slightly or in an amateur way, that the exhibition
was a notable one and the question was even asked, "How were you able to secure
such pictures for such a length of time to be placed in a temporary building?"</p>

<p>Aside from the paintings, there were some 200 black and white drawings loaned
by the Century and Scribner's magazines.These were the originals of those
published from time to time in their magazines, and were the creations of our
foremost painters and illustrators.These were greatly enjoyed by the people,
as many of them were recognized and while they lacked the charm of color, they
were so beautiful that I am certain they added greatly to the exhibition.In
addition to this there was quite an important collection of reproductions of
drawings from the old masters, loaned by Mr. George Busse.These together with
the Copley reproductions of the important Mural and decorative painting s in
America today, I find attracted a great deal of attention.There was also in
one room a very fine collection of Braune Autotypes, comprising reproductions
in carbon of the masterpieces of the world.</p>

<p>It was my opinion, and is now, that this would bring the people face to face
with the best art in the world, as could be done in no other way, the originals
being utterly out of the question to secure.In the Department of Statuary the
department was not what I wish it might have been.It was possibly the only
weak part of the art collection.This, however, is easily accounted for from
the great expense and risk connected with the shipping of marble, bronze and
plaster reproductions.Sculptors as a rule are not willing to risk their works
at so great a distance, unless guaranteed in some way the actual value or more
than the possible value of their work.Unlike pictures, statuary from its bulk
and weight, is very easily damaged, even in the moving of it, and this will
readily explain why this part of the Fine Arts exhibit was rather meager.</p>

<p>You, as well as myself, were largely indebted to the generous kindness of many
private collectors.They and the public institutions who aided in our efforts
have been recognized by you with diplomas and medals, and every one, without an
exception, have written thanking your executive committee for the honor and
compliments paid them in these diplomas and medals, it being an unusual
recognition which they greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>During the progress of the exposition, there was, as there always is, some
trying situations, but these, as a rule have passed away, and I find but very
few cases of complaint for which there was any real cause.</p>

<p>In the closing of the exposition I venture to say that no collection of such
magnitude was ever so promptly returned to the artists and owners.This has
been universally commented on.The exception being in the case where, through
misunderstandings of the railroads cases have been detained which otherwise
would have been delivered promptly, this, together with some little delays
necessary through the red tape of our custom laws, for while under the present
tariff laws a great encouragement is given to the American Artist it is quite
the reverse to pictures from foreign lands.At the present time nearly every
picture is accounted for and the whole matter being rapidly brought to a
finish.I take this opportunity of paying my respects to all the officers and
the executive committee with whom I was brought in contact.Their uniform
courtesy and willingness to do the things requested from my department made it
a pleasure to be connected with the Exposition management.Especially do I
wish to thank the Department of Exhibits for the promptness with which they
have honored my many requests for anything needed, both before, during and
since the close of the exposition, and I wish to thank you all for the "Bank"
promptness with which they have honored the necessary expenses and my own
salary.</p>

<p>I am particularly indebted to Mr. E. E. Bruce, Chief of Exhibits departments
and his able assistant, Mr. H. B. Hardt for the manner in which they so
generously took and discussed suggestions made them in the prosecution of the
work.The Art Building at all expositions is looked upon as an expense from
which there can be no return in a money way and it is apt to be considered in
the light of a white elephant, its wants utterly ignored or but grudgingly
granted.In this case, however, there was but little cause for complaint
beyond some trifling items, which, while annoying at the time soon righted
themselves.</p>

<p>With the kindest feelings and good wishes to all the Exposition Management, I
am</p>
<p>Very truly yours</p>
<p>A. H. Griffith</p>
<p>Supt. Fine Arts Bureau</p>

<p>BUREAU OF MINES AND MINING.</p>

<p>Dr. David T. Day, U.S. Geological Survey, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Superintendent.</p>

<p>The Report of the very able and affable chief of the Bureau of Mines and
Mining, was as below</p>

<p>Hon. E. E. Bruce,</p>

<p>Manager of the Department of Exhibits,</p>

<p>Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I have pleasure in submitting the following report of the administration of the
mining department of the Exposition.</p>

<p>Organization.When appointed special commissioner in charge of this department
on March 5, 1898, the mining building was completed and ready for the reception
of exhibits.</p>

<p>The work of securing exhibits had been well advanced by the energetic work of
your representative, Mr. H. B. Hardt.The floor plan was laid off to show the
arrangement of aisles and exhibit spaces.Much of the space had already been
paid for and allotted to various states and private exhibitors.Arrangement
with women of the principal state exhibitors had been made by which a certain
style of staff front for the exhibits facing on the main court had been
stipulated by Mr. Hardt.By this an unusually handsome court in the center of
the building was made possible.One exhibit, anthracite from Pennsylvania, -
had reached the building.</p>

<p>Much of the work collecting the minerals for the various states was in the
hands of the state commissioners.My first work, therefore, was to visit these
commissioners and see that their collections were in such actual progress as
would yield the best results.For this purpose a journey was made including
California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Missouri and the
Black Hills of South Dakota.In San Francisco, Mr. Richardson was already
actively at work.By my advice, and after conference with Mr. M. DeYoung, Mr.
Richardson prevailed upon the Governor of California to appoint Mr. DeYoung
Chairman of the State Commission to which were added several good workers,
including for mining, Mr. Tirey L. Ford and Mr. Charles G. Yale.After Mr.
DeYoung had duly received his title of Chief Commissioner, a few meetings were
held and then the work was promptly abandoned.</p>

<p>In Oregon the work was found to be well in hand.By the vigorous campaign of
the secretary of the commission, Mr. J.F. Batchelder of Portland, money had
been raised by private subscription and Mr. H.E. Dosch had been associated most
successfully in collecting exhibit material.</p>

<p>On arriving at Spokane Falls, Mr. H.C. Thompson, Chairman of the Mining
Commission of that state, stated that he was on the point of resigning from
lack of local support.He was not only induced to continue, but the interest
of the mayor of Rosslands, British Columbia, was also aroused, and good
exhibits resulted.</p>

<p>In Idaho the assurances were good, but the commission abandoned the work later
and without warning, too late for a new campaign.</p>

<p>In Wyoming and Colorado, much apathy was successfully contended with, and the
exhibits obtained.The same conditions were encountered in the Black Hills and
with the same fortunate result.</p>

<p>On returning, my office in the United States Geological Survey sent out about
five thousand requests for exhibits to mine operators, in states where no
commission was at work and where, as in Colorado, the need of an extra stimulus
was very evident.</p>

<p>The aim of the mining exhibits as a whole was to show uniformly and
systematically, the underground assets of the entire region west of the
Mississippi River.Also such additional exhibits from states farther east as
would show principle achievements in mining and metallurgy attained since the
Columbian Exposition at Chicago.Further exhibits were obtained which served
to familiarize western producers with such mineral products of the East as may
be reasonably sought further west.</p>

<p>Results obtained.The extent to which the above aims were accomplished, is
perhaps well indicated by the reports of the Jury of Awards given on a later
page, not because the judgment of these experts is especially commendatory, but
because it furnishes the most exact method of measuring the results.Thus, it
may be taken that a gold medal is evidence that the exhibit was either better
than the corresponding exhibit at Chicago, for example the state exhibit of
Utah, or that the material exhibited represents a marked achievement beyond the
development at that exposition, such as the exhibit of New Mexican Turquoise.</p>

<p>Other examples of recent achievements were:the cross section of the largest
electric furnace known, in which the charge of coal, sand, etc. had been
converted by the power generated at Niagara Falls, into the new abrasive
carborundum.Another metallurgical exhibit of great importance, which was
first shown at Omaha, was a large piece of artificial graphite made in the same
electric furnace.While this discovery is very recent, nevertheless, useful
industrial articles were shown made from this new form of graphite.</p>

<p>The display of gold nuggets from every known camp in the Klondike Country, also
represented a new development.The very complete collection of all varieties
of crude petroleum included a specimen from a field in Alaska, discovered
fourteen months ago.Other exhibits of materials not known at the time of the
Columbian Exposition, included a large collection of the rich telluride gold
ores from Cripple Creek, Colorado; the development of the Cyanide Process, as
carried out in Utah; the new deposits of onyx from the same state; the new iron
ores of the Mesabi region in Minnesota; the new and important siliceous gold
ores of the Black Hills, where the gold contents of an acre can be measured
with greater accuracy than anywhere except in South Africa.The state of
Washington showed the achievement of successfully using the cyanide process to
some fine gold in the peculiar gold ore of the Republic mine.They also
brought a good representation of the ores of the newly discovered British
Columbia.A cement plaster company showed the progress in that art by which
the cheapest of all raw plaster materials can be made into an efficient
substitute for a tiled wall, at a small expense.Even Arizona, without any
state commission, exceeded past records for beautiful displays of copper
carbonated.Another private exhibitor from Arizona excelled the exhibit of
silicified wood at Chicago, and beautified the building with more than one
hundred polished specimens of polished sections of silicified tree trunks.</p>

<p>Montana's contribution also excelled the remarkable exhibit at the World's
Fair.Another exhibit of unusual educational value was the column of forty
eight pure silver ingots, worth $40,000 and showing one day's product of the
Omaha &amp; Grant Smelting Company.</p>

<p>The gold medals in California's column are due to a second trip to that state
made as soon as possible after the opening of the Exposition.By this trip,
private firms were induced partially to make up for the short comings of the
commission.These exhibits were supplemented by such gold nuggets and other
interesting and characteristic specimens as I could purchase on my own account. 
Among these exhibits was the verd-antique from Santa Catalina Island, the
beautiful result of a revival of the ancient fashion of the cutting vases,
bowls, etc., out of solid rock and polishing them to translucent thinness.</p>

<p>The most instructive achievement was the collection by various states, railroad
companies and private individuals of the coals of the west, shown by full sized
sections of coal veins, and by which the fuel assets of the west could be seen
at a glance.A significant detail of this exhibit was the advance in coal
mining methods, by which the harder varieties of western coals could be sized
by "breakers" according to the Pennsylvania anthracite methods.</p>

<p>Installation.Past experience has shown two prominent faults in installing
collections of ores, and by strenuous efforts these were remedied.</p>

<p>First,- there is a tendency of the exhibitor to pile the ore in indiscriminate
heaps, by which the individuality of the specimen counts for nothing.The
result is only a trophy for the aggrandizement of some mining camp for the
education of none.</p>

<p>Second, Up to this time no mining exhibits had ever been carefully and
efficiently labeled.</p>

<p>To correct the first fault, the free loan of more than forty show cases was
obtained from the United States National Museum through the Hon. Charles D.
Walcott, Director of the Geological Survey of the United States, and at that
time, also acting in charge of the National Museum.The exhibitors were
prevailed upon to use these and abandon the fashion of ore heaps to a
sufficient extent.</p>

<p>Labeling.After much effort, the Remington Company was induced to construct a
special typewriting machine, which would hold cards of any size, and for which
a special type was cut of large size and distinct outlines.The exhibitors
were so encouraged to use this form of label that the descriptions of specimens
were thorough and complete.</p>

<p>Decorations.The mining industry has many features which cannot be brought
into an exposition, and can only be shown in picture.It was therefore
determined to to use the large sized water-color reproductions of mines,
smelting works, and other important items which otherwise could not have been
illustrated at all.This idea originated with Mr. R.T. Browne, color expert of
the Exposition Company.It was so efficiently carried out by Decorator Allen
that the exhibitors have been induced to contribute a part of the expense. 
Further decorations of the interior roof was simplified by the loan of the
large United States flag, 150 by 87 feet, which was made by the ladies of Utah
at the time of her admission to the union of states.A continuation of the
picture decoration was attempted by obtaining from the Government photographer
large photographs on glass.But the experiment proved of great cost and highly
unsatisfactory, except where the pictures were hung in the windows over the
ends of the aisles.This was because the principal light came from the roof. 
The effort to induce state commissioners to obtain and display more of these
costly glass pictures was successful as to getting the orders, but seldom in
getting them to pay their bills, much to the photographer's loss.</p>

<p>Maintenance.In so far as my experience goes, the mining building is the best
that has ever been built for the display of mineral exhibits.It afforded the
great amount of light necessary for inspecting minerals.The floor was
exceptionally well constructed and required no bracing for even the heaviest
objects.Certain features, however, rendered it difficult to maintain the
exhibit in good condition.The building leaked in two ways.The roof was bad
and the locks on the doors were a farce.They were forced repeatedly.In
first taking charge of the building, early in March, over forty leaks were
found and these increased to the proportion of a seive during the heavy rains
of May and June.</p>

<p>On June 15th I secured the services of Mr. John B. Goodman as an assistant.He
had become an expert in the maintenance of exposition buildings at the World's
Fair and at the Field Columbian Museum, where he had occupied a similar
position.His work left little to be desired, as concerns the work of
maintaining the building in good condition.The cleaning of the building by
force of night janitors under the control of the Superintendent of Buildings
and Grounds, has been exceptionally well done, and too much cannot be said for
the good work by which the toilet rooms have been kept in far better condition
than ever before at an Exposition.In spite of the size and character of the
crowds, they were normally in better condition than in good hotels.</p>

<p>Awards.The system adopted by the Bureau of Awards for the selection of jurors
and the methods of work, were enforced exactly in the Mining Building.The
jurors selected mutually by the Exposition company and the exhibitors, were
Prof. F.W. Clark, Chief Chemist of the U.S. Geological Survey and
Representative of the Interior Department on the Government Board, Prof. J.A.
Holmes, State Geologist of North Carolina, and Mr. Walter Page, Superintendent
of the Omaha and Grant Smelting Works.It is a pleasure to testify not only to
the expert character of their work, but to the fidelity with which they worked
in spite of severe weather. </p>

<p>The system devised by the Bureau, having each judge record his own opinion
separately and of having these opinions reviewed by the Superintendent of the
Department, was new to the jurors, but they unanimously agreed that the
innovation was a marked advance in jury work.The following table shows the
awards given for mining.</p>

<p>LADIES BUREAU OF ENTERTAINMENT.</p>

<p>By the direction of the President of the Exposition, one-fourth of the gallery
space in the Mining Building was assigned to the ladies of the Bureau of
Entertainment, which was fitted up in a manner which added much to the
attractiveness of the building, and this feature of having the bureau in the
mining building was carried out successfully.</p>

<p>REMOVAL OF EXHIBITS.In addition to the permits issued by the Transportation
and Exhibits Departments, each exhibitor has been required to give up a pass at
the door to the guards for every package removed from the building, this pass
being signed by no one but myself.Under this arrangement, no complications
have arisen so far as I know.</p>

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS.There is little to be said concerning how the Mining Building
should be administered, if the work should be repeated, although several
lessons can be learned by what has been written here.I should recommend that,
in addition to the complete system of lectures, such as was contemplated here,
should be added.</p>

<p>First,- A general description of the exhibits in the building to be spoken from
a phonograph at frequent intervals during the day, showing the order in which
the exhibits should be visited for the most instructive result, and describing
their characteristics.</p>

<p>Second,- Much time and energy should be given to securing demonstrations of
mining and metallurgic processes, especially the panning process, so frequently
described, but so unfamiliar to most visitors; the extraction of free gold by
quicksilver and the retorting of the resulting amalgamation.Finally, a series
of elementary lectures on mining topics, will do more to popularize a mining
exhibit than large sums spent in the effort to obtain more complete mineral
collections.</p>

<p>I would recommend that more responsibility should be expected of the
superintendent of buildings, and that the guard force should be directed to
take their orders concerning the details of each building, and that far closer
relations should exist between the head officials of the guards and the
superintendents of buildings.In the case of the Mining Building, the lack of
such instructions might have been severely felt, but for the unusual efficiency
and tact of Major Llewelyn, Commandant of the Guards, which I have had reason
to thoroughly appreciate.</p>

<p>GUARD SERVICE.On the opening day of the Exposition two guards were assigned
to the Mining Building.At my request this was increased to four, both day and
night.Most efficient men were selected by Major LLewelyn for this work, and
they served without any complaint during the entire Exposition.Their services
must be thoroughly commended.In addition to this force, several of the states
exhibits employed private watchmen.The valuable exhibit of gems in the center
of the building was furnished with an electric alarm attachment on the case.</p>

<p>CONCESSIONS.The concessions assigned to the mining Building occasioned the
principal difficulty to good administration.Of course, this assignment for
the sale of materials, inappropriate to an exhibit of mines, is perhaps the
just consequence of having unfilled space after the Exposition opened.Of all
of them, the noise of the piano was most generally objectionable.But in all
this array of incongruous shopkeepers, the only serious disgrace to the
building was the concession to the Western Optical Company, which might with
some propriety have been allotted space in the Liberal Arts Building.</p>

<p>I mention these details to bring up the question as to whether the concessions
and the Exposition Company would not have been mutually benefited had these
concessions been placed elsewhere.</p>

<p>In conclusions, I wish to testify to my appreciation of the fact that the
results obtained in the Mining Building are due primarily to the forethought of
Mr. H.B. Hardt, and the spirit of earnest work which he aroused in the state
commissioners, whose work has accomplished the greater part of this result. 
For my own work, I wish to acknowledge the courtesy and confidence displayed
toward me by President Wattles and General Secretary Wakefield, as well as
others of the Executive Committee, without which success would have been
impossible.</p>

<p>With sincere respect, yours,</p>

<p>(Signed) David T. Day,</p>
<p>Superintendent of Mining</p>

<p>BUREAUS OF AGRICULTURE--HORTICULTURE--FORESTRY--AND--IRRIGATION</p>

<p>Prof. Frederick W. Taylor,</p>

<p>University of Nebraska,</p>

<p>Superintendent</p>

<p>Richard S. Berlin,</p>

<p>Assistant Supt. of Agricultural Bureau.</p>

<p>During 1897, Prof. Taylor engaged partly in promotive work for the Exposition,
the securing of Conventions, National and Annual meetings of Societies, etc. 
The best comment that could be offered on his work in this regard, is the fact
that he got everything he went after.It is results that give value to
service.</p>

<p>Pro. Taylor's report to the Department, was as follows</p>

<p>December 27, 1898.</p>
<p>Mr. E.E. Bruce,</p>

<p>Chief Department of Exhibits,</p>
<p>T.M. &amp; I.E., Omaha, Nebr.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I beg to submit to you the following report of the more important matters
connected with the administration of the bureaus placed in my charge on June
1st, 1897.</p>

<p>After laying out the general plans along which it seemed desirable to have the
exhibits handled, the first work taken up was the attending of a number of the
various national organizations whose work relates toAgriculture and
Horticulture in order that they might be put in touch with our plans, and also
that they might be invited to hold their 1898 meetings in Omaha.THe first one
of these attended was the American Association of Nurserymen at St. Louis,
early in June, 1897.The matter of the 1898 meeting when presented was decided
in favorof Omaha, and at the proper time their organization held a very
satisfactory meeting.</p>

<p>At various times throughout the summer I visited the following organizations
with the same ends in view.</p>

<p>Society of American Florists, Providence, R.I.</p>

<p>American Forestry Association &amp; Nat'l Goods Roads Parliament, Nashville.</p>

<p>Nebraska State Horticultural Society, Lincoln.</p>

<p>American Ass'n of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, Minneapolis.</p>

<p>American Association of Farmers' Institute Managers, Columbus, Ohio.</p>

<p>American Maize Propaganda, Chicago.</p>

<p>All these organizations, without exception voted to hold their meetings in
Omaha, in accordance with our request, but in the case of one, The American
Association of Agriculture Colleges &amp; Experiment Stations, the Executive
Committee saw fit to decide otherwise during the interim before the time to
hold the meeting.Through reaching these various organizations, much was done
in the way of advertising and giving information concerning the intentions of
the Exposition along agricultural and horticultural lines, and I think the
latter work was much facilitated through the fact that the more important firms
and organizations in these lines of work, already knew, when asked to
participate individually, about what was to be done.One very important result
of drawing the attention of the larger growers to the Exposition was the
securing of the materials for nearly all the bedding down of the Bluff Tract
from exhibitors.Had this not been done, it would have been necessary to
purchase for similar use, a large amount of material.
The two buildings provided for housing the exhibits which were in my charge, -
viz:The Agricultural Building and the Horticultural Building, were very good
structures in general, and very well suited to the requirements.</p>

<p>There was one very serious defect in the Agricultural Building, arising from a
misconception of the entrance which was likely to be used by the people, which
caused no small amount of trouble, although nothing serious occurred.I refer
to the small size of the east and west doors of the building.It was doubtless
thought by the architects, that the south doors would be largely used by the
public, but such provednot to be the case, and the east and west doors were
entirely inadequate to serve the needs of the large crowds especially on the
special days.Another serious trouble in this building was the defect in the
roofing, resulting in bad leaks.The Horticultural Building was very
satisfactoryto all the exhibitors and to the public, and I think was fully as
well suited to its uses, as any building on the grounds.The securing of the
large century plant, as a center piece under the dome, was a very satisfactory
arrangement, especially during the early part of the season, when exhibits were
hard to maintain.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION.</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter to bring about concerted action on the part of
exhibitors so that the installation should be a of high class, which it was
essential to have in order that the general results might be desirable, and
when we consider the small amount of funds available by many exhibitors, I
think the results were all that could have have been expected, and more.The
exhibits in the Horticultural Building were participated in by thirteen states,
as well as a number of individual exhibitors.Many of the state exhibits was
participated in by a large number of individuals so that in the whole, there
was probably, not less than six hundred different exhibitors in this building. 
We had no way of knowing the exact number, as reports were not made to us of
the number of individuals participating in each exhibit.</p>

<p>In Agriculture the number of states participating was, fifteen, and there were
in addition, many exhibits by private persons and corporations.In this
building were put nearly all of the forestry exhibits and such irrigation
exhibits as were admissible inside buildings.From this it will be seen that,
although my work was divided into four bureaus, it practically was but two, as
forestry came with agriculture, and irrigation might have been classed, either
with agriculture or irrigation.</p>

<p>The feature most commented upon with regard to the exhibits in the Agricultural
Building was the large use made of the various grains in a decorative way to
illustrate the productiveness of the various states.It was said repeatedly,
and I think with truth, that in this particular this exhibit stood ahead of any
exhibit of the kind, ever made.There seems to have been a general growth
dating from the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, a natural consequence, perhaps of
the immense strides made by this industry in America, resulting in putting the
United States far ahead of all other grain growing countries in acreage, as
well as in bushels produced.</p>

<p>In Horticulture, perhaps the most notable thing was the fact that from the
opening day to the closing day there was never a time that there was not upon
the table a large and attractive exhibit of fresh fruits.At all other
expositions it has been impossible to open on advertised time with a good
exhibit, because of the fact that so little attention has been paid to the use
of cold storage by the states of Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois for this
particular purpose and in most cases the fruit came through in excellent
condition so that when put upon the table it might have been fresh from the
trees so far as fine appearance was concerned.</p>

<p>AWARDS.</p>

<p>In Agriculture three member jury was used in judging exhibits, in Horticulture,
on the other hand, a more modern method of using a single expert juror was
followed with the most satisfactory results to all concerned.We were
fortunate in being able to secure the services of the Hon. E.E. Vandeman of
Virginia, for a number of years United States Pomologist, and his decisions
were in every case satisfactory to those who made the exhibits, as well as to
the representatives of the Exposition.In both departments, however, there was
no complaint practically and the highest commendation should be given to the
gentlemen who consented to act as jurors.They were all men of the highest
standing whose decisions were above suspicion.</p>

<p>CONCESSIONS.</p>

<p>My own opinion, as frequently expressed, was that the putting of concessions in
exhibit buildings is never desirable and when carried beyond the smallest
percentage possible as compared with the number of exhibits is not only
troublesome but absolutely pernicious.In the Horticulture Building only three
concessions were admitted and these were conducted in such a way as to
interfere in no wise with exhibitors nor with those who were visiting the
exposition in order to study the exhibits.In the Agricultural Building,
however, many more concessions were admitted and, to my mind, there is no
question that they reduced the value of the exhibits to a certain extent?I
think the judgment of those connected with expositions, both here and
elsewhere, has been that the admissions of more than a very small number of
well conducted concessions detracts from the dignity of the exposition and is a
means of producing dissatisfaction and adverse comment from visitors.</p>

<p>OUTSIDE EXHIBITS.</p>

<p>There was secured through the Bureau of Horticulture as exhibits,twenty seven
exhibitors, who furnished material for beds on the grounds on the Bluff tract. 
These were of the greatest value to the Exposition as such, and also proved a
highly satisfactory method of exhibiting their wares on the part of the various
florists, all of whom have expressed to me their entire satisfaction with that
method of exhibiting.Of those directly connected with me in the more public
work of the bureau of my charge, I wish to express my sincere appreciation of
the assistance rendered by Mr. H.B. Hardt, the Assistant Chief of the
Department, who by his wide knowledge of expositions in general, was able to
afford very much valuable information and many helpful suggestions.Shortly
before the opening of the Exposition, Mr. R.S. Berlin was appointed by the
Executive Committee, assistant superintendent of the Department of Agriculture,
and to him also, I wish to express my hearty appreciation of valuable services
rendered.Mr. Berlin was always willing to assist in every way possible and he
proved very popular with the exhibitors and was very helpful in every way.</p>

<p>In summing up, itmay not be out of place to mention that, as representing the
department of exhibits, not only in my own bureaus, but often in other ways, I
visited, not only the organizations which are enumerated at the beginning of
this report, but made many trips which took me, in the aggregate, into 22
different states east of the Mississippi River and eight west of it.During my
trips it was my duty and pleasure, not only to look after exhibit work in
general but also to do more or less along the line of Publicity and Promotion,
in which work I co-operated under the instruction of the General Secretary and
the Executive Committee and with the chief of the Department of Publicity and
Promotion.In this way I visited the governors commissioners and other
officers, who were co-operating in one way or another with the Exposition, and
did what I could to stimulate them in their work.Exact results from work of
this kind are almost impossible to present, but in general it may be said that
whatever states were visited and the officials thoroughly informed as to just
what was actually being done prepatory to the exposition, there was a
noticeable increase of interest thereafter, due to the fact of their having
definite knowledge.In this way it seems likely that all such visits were
productive of much more than enough good to pay for their cost.</p>

<p>In closing, permit me to extend my thanks to you, who as chief of the
department of Exhibits, always supported my work in that way which makes it
easy and withal a pleasure to carry it on.</p>

<p>Yours very truly,</p>

<p>BUREAUS OF LIVE STOCK, DIARY PRODUCTS AND PET ANIMALS.</p>

<p>John B. Dinsmore, Superintendent.</p>

<p>C.H. Elmendorf, Asst. in Live Stock.</p>

<p>S.C. Bassett, Asst. in Dairy Products.</p>

<p>J. Llewellyn, Asst. in Poultry.</p>

<p>Live Stock Bureau.</p>

<p>The Exposition Management when considering the subject of awards to be made in
the Bureaus of Live Stock and Dairy Products planned to depart from the usual
custom of Expositions, State Fairs and other exhibitors and in place of making
awards of cash prizes and ribbons decided to award trophies, gold, silver and
bronze medals and diplomas and plans for this exhibition were made upon this
basis.This decision did not meet with the approval of the live stock
interests of the country and upon their urgent request and solicitation the
plans were, later, changed.The Board of Directors determined that cash prizes
with the usual accompanying ribbons should be offered to the amount of $35,000
and new rules and classifications were prepared, providing for distribution of
said amount of money in prizes in the various classes of live stock.</p>

<p>The report of Mr. Dinsmore in charge of the Department of live stock, is as
follows:</p>

<p>E.E. Bruce,
Manager Exhibits Dept.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I beg leave to submit the following reports of the various divisions of
exhibits under my charge.The Superintendent of the Department of Live Stock,
Poultry and Dairy being appointed June 25th, 1897, the work of organizing and
preparing the exhibits of these several departments was taken in hand at once
by notifying the live stock, poultry and dairy organs of the appointment and
the intended scope of the exhibit, and the probable total premiums that would
be awarded.This was at once followed up by thousands of circular letters
forwarded to the principal breeders of live stock and poultry throughout the
United States and Canada, asking their co-operation in the enterprise of the
live stock, poultry and dairy exhibit, and a promise that, as soon as prepared
the premium list, rules and regulations would be forwarded for their guidance
and government.After consulting with persons of large experience in
connection with the live stock shows of the country, rules and regulations were
formulated, presented to the executive committee and by them approved.It
contemplated the distribution of $35,000 in cash premiums in the live stock and
poultry department.The premium list showing the classification and the amount
of money offered to each breed of stock was forwarded as widely as our
knowledge of the breeders extended, and authority was given through the press
that contemplated exhibitors or others interested would be furnished copies of
the premium list upon application either to Mr. E. E. Bruce, Manager of the
department of exhibits, or to J. B. Dinsmore, Superintendent of the department
of live stock, poultry and dairy.These premium lists were forwarded very
generally throughout the United States and Canada, and in some instances being
sent upon request to parties in Mexico.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the department and the spreading of the information as to
its scope, and making acquaintance with the exhibitors in the field at the
various state fairs, your commissioner visited the Minnesota State Fair at
Hamlin, Minnesota also that of Iowa held at Des Moines and the Nebraska State
Fair at Omaha, making personal acquaintances among the exhibitors that he had
not heretofore met, and urged upon them the benefits to be derived by attending
the Trans-Mississippi Exposition with the products of their herds and flocks. 
He also attended the national Live Stock Convention at Denver, in January,
1898, also the National Dairy Mens' Association held at Topeka Kansas, in
February, 1898.These several visits entailed the expenditure of considerable
time and money but the results obtained are believed to have fully justified
the expenditure of time and money.</p>

<p>In the Live Stock Department Mr. C. H. Elmendorf of Lincoln, Nebraska was
selected as assistant Superintendent in August, 1898, assuming his duties at
once and proved a most efficient and valuable assistant.I desire to return my
thanks to him for the painstaking care displayed and the thoroughness of his
preparation of the department and especially that portion of it relating to the
preparation of the official catalogue.</p>

<p>Special rules, information and premium lists were prepared, published and
circulated generally among the live stock interests of the country.A copy of
the rules in brief is given below, together with a list of the exhibitors of
live stock and also a list of the prize winners in each of the classes.</p>

and the animal or animals entered by him will be excluded from the grounds.</p>

<p>12.In addition to the exhibits provided for in rule 1, the Manager of the

in addition to those enumerated in the premium list when, in his judgment, the
interest of the Exposition will be advanced thereby.Animals entered in such
additional classes will have the right to compete for such premiums as the
manager of the Department of Exhibits may designate at the time the classes are
formed.</p>

<p>14.The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition being open to the
world, it is important that in the exhibits provided for by rule 1 only the
best animals of their kind be exhibited.For this reason the manager of the
Department of Exhibits has authority, if, in his opinion, any animal offered
for admission is not a typical representative of its kind, to exclude the same
from the grounds of the exposition.</p>

<p>15.The manager of the Department of Exhibits is authorized to order the
removal of vicious or fractious animals from the grounds.</p>

<p>16.Exhibitors will be required to furnish necessary attendants, who will be
subject to the Rules and Regulations governing employees of the Bureau of Live
Stock.In case of failure on the part of any attendant to obey said rules and
Regulations, the exhibitor agrees to discharge him, upon the request of the
Manager of the Department.</p>

<p>17.The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition will provide
accommodations for such exhibits of Livestock as may be accepted by the

<p>19.The manager will appoint a veterinary surgeon and such other assistants as
may be necessary.The veterinary surgeon shall cause all animals to be
examined before their admission to the grounds, as a safeguard against
infectious or contagious diseases, and shall make inspection of the grounds,
stables, stalls and pens and make report in writing to the manager of the
Department of Exhibits of the condition in which said grounds, stables, stalls
and pens are kept.In case of sickness of any animals, the same shall be
removed, when ordered by the manager of the department to a separate enclosure,
where the exhibitor may either direct the treatment of the animal himself, or
employ the veterinary surgeon appointed for the Bureau of Live Stock, for whose
services and other necessary expenses incurred, a reasonable charge will be
made by the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.The right is
reserved to the Manager of the Department to order the peremptory removal from
the grounds of any animal to which this rule applies.</p>

<p>20.Ample facilities will be provided for the distribution of water throughout
the grounds.</p>

purpose, subject to such special regulations as the Manager of the Department
of Exhibits may deem necessary.</p>

<p>23.In awarding premiums in Divisions A, B, C, D and E experts will judge all
animals taking part in each section, placing them in order of their relative
superiority; beginning with the first, they will number all such animals
consecutively, and report to the manager of the department the number given
each animal in such competition, and also the regular number assigned to such
animal on the register of the Live Stock Bureau.Premiums will be paid in
accordance with the numbering so returned by the judge; i.e. 1st, 2nd 3rd,
certificate of Highly Commended and Certificate of Commended will be issued for
animals rated next in order of merit to those to which premiums are awarded. 
In the event of expulsion or disqualification of an animal after such
numbering, its rating will be expunged form the record and the subsequent
numbers of competing animals will be correspondingly advanced.</p>

<p>24.In case of doubt by a judge acting under authority of the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, as to any fact required by the
Rules of the Live Stock Bureau in connection with the entry of an animal for
competition, satisfactory proof in writing must be furnished by an exhibitor
within a specified time (to be named by said Judge) unless the doubt exists as
to the age of an animal, in which case an examination shall be made by the
veterinary surgeon; and should his report be that the age has not been
correctly stated, or should the evidence submitted by an exhibitor in answer to
the inquiry of the Judge be unsatisfactory, the said animal shall be barred
from competing in the Live Stock Bureau.</p>

<p>25.No appeal from the decision of any judge, acting under authority of the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, will be entertained; awards so
made will be final.</p>

department of Exhibits before the close of the period assigned for the exhibit
in the division to which the animal protested belongs.</p>

<p>27.Numbers alone will be used to designate stock on the Exposition grounds
prior to the award of premiums.</p>

<p>28.No animals will be admitted from districts of the United States from which

or the regulations of the state of Nebraska in force during the period of the
Exposition.</p>

<p>29.In the event of death of any animal entered for competition, or such
disability as in the opinion of the Manager of the Department of Exhibits
disqualifies such animal for exhibition.The Manager of the Department of
Exhibits may authorize the substitution of another animal, provided that such
substitute was in all respects eligible at the date of filing of the original
application.</p>

<p>30.The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition will not be responsible
for any injury to or for the death of any animal.</p>

<p>31.An official catalogue will be issued by the Trans-Mississippi and

<p>The display of horses was very fine in quality and fully up in point of numbers
to what had been expected prior to the closing of entries.The small number of
horses shown is accounted for in this way; owing to the great depression in the
horse and mule industry and the dispersionof many of the valuable studs,
owing to the financial difficulties extending back to 1893, 1894 and 1895.</p>

publishing the same, must accompany each application for the entry of sheep of
the following breeds.</p>

<p>Shropshire; Southdown; Oxford; Hampshire; Cotswold; Leisester; Lincoln;

breeds.</p>

<p>Applications for the entry of sheep of breeds other than those mentioned above
must be accompanied by the information required by rules 8 and 9.</p>

<p>Sheep offered for admission under an entry must be accompanied by a sworn
statement giving date of shearing, which for sheep exhibited from the United
States and Canada, must not be earlier than April 1st, 1898.Experts of award
will exclude from competition all sheep which in their opinion, have been
improperly sheared, or have been so well clipped as to conceal natural defects
or whose fleeces have been artificially colored, singed or oiled.</p>

<p>Unimproved Sheep.</p>

<p>Entries may be made of specimens of unimproved types of sheep which, in the
opinion of the Superintendent of the Department of Live Stock possess historic
or other interest to visitors.Sheep entered in this class will not be allowed
to compete for premiums but may be viewed and referred to in the official

<p>POULTRY---EXHIBITS.</p>

<p>C. M. LLEWELLYN,</p>
<p>Beaver City, Nebr.</p>
<p>Superintendent in Charge.</p>

<p>There were about 500 birds on exhibition.The exhibit of poultry was small and unsatisfactory to both exhibitors and the Department of Exhibits.This was believed by the superintendent of the Live Stock Exhibits to have been due to the fact that the superintendent for this branch of exhibits was not appointed earlier that it might be known in time who was to have the actual charge of the Poultry Department and emphasizes the fact that exhibitors must know who is to have charge of the exhibit and care of the birds before they will make entries or forward them for exhibition.</p>

<p>Theodore Hewes of Trenton Missouri, and L. P. Harris of Palmyra, Nebraska are authority for saying that the birds presented for scoring were of the highest merit and would have made a good report in any line of competition.</p>

<p>Mr. C. M. Llewellyn of Beaver City, Nebraska was, at a late day appointed superintendent of this branch of exhibits and did everything in his power to make the exhibit a success.From years of acquaintance with him I know him to be both capable and energetic; that the exhibit should have been so small was not chargeable to him and I desire to tender my thanks for the thorough and systematic manner of his conduct of these exhibits.</p>

<p>The rules under which exhibits of poultry and pigeons were solicited and received and a list of those to whom awards were made is given next below.</p>

<p>POULTRY.</p>

<p>Each exhibitor must forward with his application for entry 50 cents for each bird he proposes to exhibit, to pay for the feeding and care of the same.</p>

<p>All poultry offered for admission under an entry from the United States will be examined by a committee of three, who shall return to the exhibitor any bird which, in their opinion, is inferior, sick, out of condition, or which will not score 85 points in its class, according to the American standard of perfection.</p>

<p>No one exhibitor of poultry will be allowed to enter more than four birds, i.e. one cock, one hen etc., of any one breed and but one breeding pen (one male and four females) of any one breed.(b) One cockrell, one pullet, pen checks i.e. one cockrell and four pullets.(c)</p>

<p>Poultry from foreign countries will be admitted under the rules governing the admission of fowls at competitive displays in said countries.</p>

<p>Birds will be scored according to the American standard of perfection.</p>

<p>Heaviest pair of capons.</p>

<p>Each exhibitor will be required to furnish their own exhibition coops, of standard size, viz:for chickens twenty inches deep, 30 inches long and 30 inches high; for pens 24 inches deep, 30 inches high and 48 inches long; for turkeys 36 inches deep, 36 inches long and 48 inches high; for ducks, 30 inches deep, 30 inches high and 36 inches long; for geese 36 inches deep, 36 inches high and 48 inches long.</p>

<p>Poultry exhibits were classified and designated as follows:</p>

<p>Class I American Class IX Bantams other than Game</p>
<p>Class II Asiatic Class X Turkeys</p>
<p>Class III Mediterranean Class XI Ducks</p>
<p>Class IV PolishClass XII Geese</p>
<p>Class V HamburgsClass XIII Ornamental</p>
<p>Class VI MixedClass XIV Pet Stock</p>
<p>Class VII Miscellaneous Class XV Minor Pets</p>

<p>DAIRY AND DAIRY PRODUCTS.</p>

<p>Hon. S. C. Bassett,</p>

<p>Gibbon, Nebraska,</p>

<p>Assistant Superintendent</p>

<p>It was first planned to give cash premiums in the Dairy and Dairy Products
branch of the exhibits, but after due and full consideration the plan was
modified as to dairy products and medals and diplomas were awarded the same as
to general exhibitors in other departments of the Exposition.The dates
determined upon for dairy products exhibits contemplated five separate exhibits
on each class during the months of June, July, August, September and October. 
Cheese was to be exhibited in the month of October only.Rules governing the
exhibit of dairy products were prepared and sent to prospective exhibitors. 
The list of those to whom awards were made, under this class of exhibits will
be found in the list of diplomas and medals awarded to exhibitors in the report
of the Bureau of Awards.</p>

<p>It was planned to have a thorough system of refrigeration, that all the
products might be properly kept and cared for.Owing to the difficulties in
installing the refrigeration plant in the Dairy Building and the construction
and suitable installation of the refrigeration boxes, the first exhibit of
butter did not take place until in July.When put to the test the
refrigeration boxes were found to be faulty, and owing to repairs and
improvements being made upon them the second exhibit did not occur until
August.The other three exhibits followed in the months of September and
October.The number of exhibits in the first display was not satisfactory
owing to the lack of satisfactory and assuring information as to the condition
of the refrigeration plant and the boxes prepared for the preservation of the
goods.As soon as the improvements and repairs were perfected and the
refrigeration plant ran twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four there as no
difficulty in maintaining the temperature not to exceed thirty-five degrees,
and in fact, the temperature of zero might have been maintained, had it been
desired.</p>

<p>Early in July 1898, Hon. S. C. Bassett of Gibbon, Nebraska was selected as
Assistant Superintendent of the Dairy Exhibits to assist the superintendent in
the care of the work incident to that branch of exhibits.He proved to be a
very efficient, painstaking and reliable assistant and I desire at this time to
return thanks to him for his unceasing care of all the minutia of the work.</p>

<p>The refrigeration plant used was manufactured by the A. H. Barbour
Manufacturing Co. of Chicago, Ill.The motive power was electricity and the
plant proved to be entirely satisfactory to the authorities under modified
conditions which actual use proved to be necessary.</p>

<p>"Hon. J. B. Dinsmore:</p>

<p>Superintendent of Live Stock, Dairy, Etc. Exhibits</p>

<p>Dear Sir:As Assistant Superintendent of the competitive dairy exhibit of the Trans Mississippi Exposition, I took charge of said department the last week in August, at which time the butter for the second contest had arrived and was ready to be judged.</p>

<p>The refrigerators in the Dairy Building were at that time in a satisfactory condition and so continued until the close of the Exposition. The judging of all butter exhibits was by Mr. W. D. Collyer of Marshalltown, Iowa, whom I believe to be thoroughly competent and whose work as expert judge gave as good satisfaction as could be expected where competition is close and sharp.</p>

<p>Upon entering upon by duties I found that the rules governing dairy exhibits were somewhat conflicting and capable of more thanone interpretation and, with the approval of yourself and the proper Exposition officials the same were changed to provide that any exhibitor in the department whose exhibit scored more than 95 points should be entitled to diploma and bronze medal.Where his exhibit scored 97 or more points he should be entitled to diploma for silver medal and to the exhibitor making highest score (Providing same be above 97) should be awarded diploma for Gold Medal.Five competition butter exhibits were held, one in the month of July, one in August, one in September and two in October. A summary of Exhibitors and exhibits is as follows:</p>

<p>Total number of exhibitors,.................... 205</p>
<p>Total number of packages,...................... 489</p>
<p>Total score of all exhibits,................... 45,604</p>

<p>In justice to many exhibitors it should be said that, with the exception of exhibits from Minnesota, which were transported in refrigerator cars and
transferred at once on arrival to the refrigerators in the Dairy Building,
exhibits from all other states came either by express or freight and were thus exposed to conditions not deemed the most favorable for butter intended for competition.</p>

<p>Mention should be made of the highly instructive and meritorious permanent exhibit made by Supt. B. R. Stoufer of the Nebraska State Commission. This exhibit represented the work in a Nebraska creamery, showing butter in all its various stages, from that in the churn to a large assortment of packages of all kinds ready for the market.Minnesota also had a small but meritorious permanent exhibit during the last months of the Exposition.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting exhibits in the Dairy Building and one that
attracted universal attention was that of the noted artist, Mrs. Caroline Shawk Brooks, who busts, modeled in butter, of Admiral Dewey, Abraham Lincoln, President McKinley and others were the admiration of the thousands who beheld them.</p>

<p>CHEESE.</p>

<p>The exhibit of cheese made in the month of October was small and disappointing, there being fifteen exhibitors and thirty-two packages.None of the cheese scored sufficiently high to receive a diploma of the second class.</p>

<p>AWARDS.</p>

<p>The list of awards will be found in the general awards in report of Awards Bureau.</p>

<p>Below please find the report of T. H. Lyon of the University of Nebraska,
Lincoln, Nebraska, reporting the results of tests of Milch Cows.</p>

<p>I have the honor to report herewith the result of the "Test of Milch Cows" conducted under my supervision at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the rules governing the test, as published by the
Department of Exhibits, Bureau of Live Stock, Dairy, Poultry and Pet Animals.</p>

<p>RULE I.The test shall be made for ten days and shall be open to all cows. 
Heifers with first calf shall be in a class by themselves.</p>

<p>RULE II.All cows entered for competition shall be under control of the
committee in charge during the test and for two days prior thereto.They shall
be fed and milked under the direction of the committee, the owner of the cow
being allowed to name the person who cares for and milks the cow.They may
receive at the direction of the owner any amount or proportion of the following
foods viz:corn and oats, ground wheat bran, linseed meal, corn silage, clover
hay, timothy hay and prairie hay.</p>

<p>All feed used shall be weighed and samples analyzed, and each cow shall be
charged with the dry matter therein.But the same feeds and the same
proportion of each shall be continued throughout the test in each case.When
the ration is adopted, only the amount fed can be carried.Each cow shall be
charged with the total amount of food given, no allowance being made for food
not consumed.</p>

<p>RULE III.As a basis for comparison, one point shall be allowed for each pound
of solids not fat, and ten points for each pound of fat contained in the milk.</p>

<p>The points obtained in this way shall be increased by one per cent for each
week of lactation after the first month.In no case, however, shall more than
twenty-five per cent increase be allowed for advancing lactation.</p>

<p>The number of points obtained in this way, divided by the number of pounds of
dry matter in the food consumed during the test will give a factor which
represents the relative food economy of the cows being tested.This factor
multiplied by an arbitrary number (five is recommended) shall be added for each
day of the test and the sum shall constitute the score.The cow having the
largest score, obtained in this way, shall be considered the best.</p>

<p>997.Premium for Cows.</p>

<p>Dip. for Dip. for Dip. for High Com. Com.</p>
<p>Gold Med. Sil. Med. Bronz Med. " " "</p>

<p>998.Premium for Heifers.</p>

<p>Dip. forDip. forDip. forHigh Com. Com.</p>
<p>Gold Med. Sil. Med. Bronz Med. " " "</p>

<p>In case of tie between cows or between heifers, each shall be entitled to the
same premium.</p>

<p>These rules were followed strictly in accordance with your interpretation with
the exception of the provision under Rule I which specifies that the test shall
be for ten days.At the unanimous request of those entering animals for the
test, and upon your approval of the same, it was decided to curtail the time to
seven days.The following is a list of the entries.</p>

<p>The animals entered in the test were placed in a barn by themselves on October
10, and were under the supervision of the judge from that time.The cattle
were comfortable throughout the entire test, except one night when melted snow
leaked through the roof.There was no complaint on the part of the competitors
with the arrangements for housing the stock.The barn was kept locked
throughout the entire time of the test so that the animals were not disturbed
by visitors.A guard was also stationed outside to prevent anyone from
entering.The feed was weighed at the time of feeding.Each competitor was
allowed to select his own time for feeding and milking.They all fed three
times a day and, with one exception, milked three times a day.</p>


<p>At six o'clock on the evening of October 11th the animals were all milked in
the presence of the judge, after which the milk from each animal was weighed at
each milking up to and including the milking on the evening of October 18.A
sample of about one quart was taken from the milk of each animal, this was
taken to the labratory where the per cent of butter fat and solid matters it
contained was determined.The labratory was kept locked and no one but those
conducting the test admitted.Samples were taken of all of the foods used by
the competitors and sent to the University of Nebraska for a determination of
dry matter.In this way all of the data was collected that was necessary to a
calculation of the relative merits of the animals entered in accordance with
the rules of the test.</p>

<p>NEBRASKA FARMER SPECIAL PREMIUMS.</p>

<p>To commemorate its Twenty-sixth anniversary and to contribute to the success of
the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition, the publishers of the
Nebraska Farmer, H. F. McIntosh, Editor offered $1,350.00 in special premiums
to exhibitors and patrons of the Exposition under the following conditions.</p>

<p>1st.In Live Stock, all animals shall be pure bred and American Bred.</p>

<p>2nd.The winning animal in each class will be the one adjudged best by the
regular judge or judges employed by the Exposition Management or the
Superintendent of the Live Stock Exhibits.</p>

<p>3rd.In every class where awards are to be made, there must be three or more
competitors.</p>

<p>$850.00 of the amount for special premiums was arranged to cover exhibits of
cattle, horses, sheep, swine, fat stock, poultry, apiarian goods and supplies,
honey, wax, ornamental, etc.These premiums covered all classes of the various
exhibits and the length of the list prevents its being included in detail in
this report.These premiums were all payable in advertising in the Nebraska
Farmer.</p>

<p>Cash premiums aggregating $500 and ranging from $100 to $1.00 were offered by
the Nebraska Farmer to subscribers who were first to guess nearest to the total
number of paid admissions to the Exposition during its full period, from June
1st to November 1st, 1898, 153 days in all.This offer was made under specific
conditions and provided for premiums on the 163 nearest estimates.</p>

<p>--------------end of report from Live Stock Department-----(added for
clarificaton 1998)</p>


<p>The foregoing report of proceedings, including report of assistants, together
with the list of exhibitors to whom awards were made practically covers the
work of this department, stated as briefly as possible for historical purposes. 
It would be impracticableto give a list of all exhibitors and hence it has
been thought wise to confine the information as to exhibitors in this record to
those to whom awards were made.</p>

<p>I desire in this connection to return my thanks and those of my assistants to
the gentlemen who served as judges and clerks in the various departments,
acting with the various superintendents and thus making in each class of
exhibits a committee of three, consisting of the judges, superintendents and
clerks, in scoring and recording the findings as to the relative values of the
various exhibits.</p>

<p>I desire further to extend my thanks to you as manager of the Department of
Exhibits and to those of the Exposition management who contributed by their aid
and helpful influence toward making the work of your superintendent both
pleasant and satisfactory.</p>

<p>With respect, I am Very Truly Yours,</p>

<p>BUREAU OF
BEE INDUSTRIES</p>

<p>E. Whitcomb, Friend, Nebr., Superintendent</p>

<p>The Busy Bee and the results of its industrious industry afforded the
opportunity for exhibits of bee products and appliances used, that were of
general interest to all visitors and of special interest to many.The very
full report of Superintendent Whitcomb, follows:</p>

<p>Omaha, Nebraska, November 11th, 1898</p>

<p>Mr. E. E. Bruck,</p>
<p>Manager Department of Exhibits, Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition, Omaha, Nebraska,</p>
<p>June to November, 1898</p>

<p>My Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I beg leave to submit the following report of my doings in the Bureau of Bee
Industries.On the 28th of August, 1897, I visited the annual meeting of the
United States Bee-Keepers Union, held at Buffalo, New York, with a view to
securing the next meeting of that organization to be held at Omaha, some time
during the Exposition.I found much of a sentiment in favor of following the
reunion of the Grand Army of the Republic, on account of the usually low rates
that follow the meetings of that organization, and that by a peculiar wording
of the constitution, the location of the place of the next meeting was in the
hand of the executive committee, composed of the President, Vice president and
secretary, and that the convention was powerless to name the place of its next
meeting.We, however, presented the claims of Omaha, in the best manner
possible and went to work creating what sentiment possible in favor of holding
the meeting at that point, and left the balance of the work to be completed by
correspondence, which was carried on until the 10th of August, 1898, when the
meeting was located at Omaha for September 13th, 14th and 15th.This meeting
was very generally attended, and proved to have been well up to the average in
interest, with members present from Washington, D. C., Ohio, Illinois, Iowa,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado and Utah, winding up
the convention with a meeting at the Apiary Building, and at which time not
only the full delegation was present, but Major Clarkson, General Manager of
the Exposition, and H. B. Hardt, Superintendent of the Exhibits Department were
also present together with a corps of Newspaper reporters.</p>

<p>After addresses by Major Clarkson, Rev. Emerson T. Abbott of St. Joseph, Mo.
and Hon. G. W. Swink of Rocky Ford, Colorado those present were treated to a
splendid layout of Rocky Ford melons and in which Senator Swink did the honors
of the occasion.</p>

<p>During January of 1898, I visited the meeting of the Northwestern Bee Keepers
Association, held at the New Briggs House, Chicago, Ills. with a view of
working up an interest in the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, but found this
organization to be more of a local affair than was at first supposed.</p>

<p>Since my appointment and up to the time for installing exhibits, and extensive
correspondence was carried on with state commissioners, presidents of
bee-keepers' associations in the different states, until twelve hundred letters
were written.On the 17th of May, 1898, we came to Omaha and opened up an
office in the Apiary Building, with a view of installing exhibits, in time for
the opening day, June 1st, 1898.This we found slow work, from the fact that
some of the states had none of their crop of 1897, on hand with which to make
an exhibit, and those who had feared to put up theirs, lest, those coming later
might take advantage of their plans and pattern after them.And while the work
of installing went on slowly, it was not fully completed until early September,
when the Nebraska State Commission with Mr. L. D. Stilson of York, Nebraska as
Superintendent, and Mr. G. M. Whitford of Arlington, Nebr. as assistant,
occupied 900 feet of space.Douglas County with August C. Davidson of Omaha as
Superintendent and Mrs. F. G. Priess of South Omaha as his assistant occupying
400 feet.The State of Minnesota, E. K. Jaques, Supt. 500 Feet;the Utah
Commission with Mrs. S. T. Whitacre of Ogden, Utah, as superintendent,
occupying 240 feet of space;Hon. G. W. Swink of Rocky Ford, Colorado,
occupying 50 feet; L. G. Clute of Greeley, Iowa, occupying 50 feet and E.
Kretchmer of Red Oak, Iowa, occupied 50 feet.In supplies, E. Kretchmer, Red
Oak, Iowa, occupied 100 feet, the G. B. Lewis Co. of Watertown, Wis. jointly
with Emerson T. Abbot of St. Joseph, Mo. occupied 150 feet; the I. A. Root Co.
of Medina, Ohio, 200 feet and the Leahy Manufacturing Co. of Higginsville, Mo.
40 feet.These exhibits, not so much in quantity as those shown at Chicago at
the Columbian Exposition, by far exceeded it in display and the number of
varieties shown and was the finest exhibit of its class ever opened to the
public anywhere and reflected great credit upon the individual exhibitors and
states above named.On September 16, Hon. Eugene Secor of Forest City, Ia. was
chosen as an Expert Judge on this Bureau and at once began his work.By
complete system of score cards, the judge not being allowed to know whose work
was before him, and noting down in the cards the points of excellence of each,
with a possible total of 100, resulting in award of 86 premium diplomas, and
medals to exhibitors, distributed by states as follows:Colorado 3, Iowa 18,
Kansas 6, Minnesota 13, Missouri 3, Nebraska 34, Ohio 2, Utah 4, Wisconsin 3. 
The names of exhibitors taking premiums diplomas and medals will be found in
the general list in report of Awards Bureau.</p>

<p>The thanks of the beekeepers and supply dealers participating in this
Exposition are due and are extended to the management of the Trans-Mississippi
and to Mr. E. E. Bruce and his able assistant H. B. Hardt for the fine building
and other facilities furnished them and for making this exhibit and which they
feel has not been excelled in the history of exhibits in the world.On the
date first above written I turned over the Apiary Building to the Supt. of
Buildings &amp; Grounds leaving behind many fond recollections of courtesies shown
this department during nearly twelve months which we were connected with it and
five of which was in active exhibit work.
Respectfully Submitted,
(Signed) E. Whitcomb.
Supt. Bureau of Bee Industry.</p>

<p>MACHINERY AND ELECTRIC EXHIBITS</p>

<p>Prof. H. B. Owens, Nebraska State University, Superintendent.</p>

<p>MACHINERY AND ELECTRICITY.</p>

<p>Machinery Section</p>

<p>(Owing to the resignation of the Superintendent of this Building, Prof. R. B.
Owens, in September, this Bureau reverted to my charge and is therefore
reported upon by me as assistant to the Manager of the Department.)</p>

<p>As the West has always been considered and is admittedly an agricultural rather
than a manufacturing section of the country it was not anticipated that a large
exhibit of manufacturing machinery would be made.More attention was given to
that class of machinery which would be of use to the west, than to the
intricate and delicate machinery that has become of necessity to the east.For
this reason the exhibit was limited to those engines and machines for the
transmission of power, together with such tools and appliances as were required
by the western artisan, mechanic and farmer.In quality and adaptability,
these were unsurpassed.The lesser devices for the minimizing labor in the
household and the farm were in evidence, and taken as a whole, the machinery
section made a distinctively creditable display from a general standpoint, and
from the view that it was made for a separate and distinct class of citizens on
a sectional basis, it was unexcelled.</p>

<p>The existence of an international war in which we were one of the belligerents,
naturally aroused the public interest in arms and ammunitions of war, from a
patriotic sentiment almost to the exclusion of the implements of peace.It is
therefore not surprising that the different exhibits in this building which
were of a warlike nature, held the majority of sightseers.In times of peace,
these exhibits, however, were so instructive and elaborate that they deserve
more than a passing notice.Everything in fire arms was shown, from a small
vest-pocket pistol to a two-inch breech loading Hotchkiss gun;from the old
style single barrel, muzzle loading shot-gun to an automatic rifle with a
capacity of four hundred shots per minute;projectiles from the minute 18.
calibre, short cartridge to the six inch steel pointed shell cartridge and all
complete;shot and shell cartridges for both military and sporting use; 
ordinarily all smokeless powder;a six pounder shell, taken from the wreck of
the ill fated "Maine".Sections of four inch Harveyized steel armour were
shown to be absolutely powerless against the ordinary type of six pound steel
projectile at present in use in the United States Navy, riddling the armour
like a sieve, leaving the projectile apparently unharmed.</p>

<p>Practical illustration was given of the penetrative power of the new jacketed
and steel pointed rifle bullets as compared with the old style rifle ball of
lead.In fact a complete representation of all the destructive agencies of
modern warfare, except the larger armament and naval torpedoes.</p>

<p>Side by side with these grim agents of war, were the implements of peace, the
tools of the husbandman, the artisan, the farmer and the tradesman.In close
juxtaposition, the great educator of civilization, the printing press in
connection with many labor saving devices in the art preservative were given
practical object lessons in the arts of peace.</p>

<p>Wrought iron designs of very ornate and beautiful effect, a myriad of sanitary
appliances and household articles of the most useful and desirable description
also found an honored place.The scale exhibit showed an advancement at once
notable and wonderful in showing the great improvements made during the last
decade in this particular important article.Endowed with almost a human
intelligence some of the scales shown indicated not only weight, but price per
pound and amount of purchase.</p>

<p>Among other exhibits, were gasoline engines, purifying pumps, leather belting,
automatic boiler cleaners, filters, faucets, builder's heavy and light
hardware, mills, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Electricity Section.</p>

<p>There is no field of inventive genius in the capability of mankind that has
shown greater advancement, or where the possibilities of future development is
so apparently illimitable as that of electricity.It is to be regretted that
more space was not available to give this one line greater scope.The exhibit
made was entirely creditable, and was the best ever exhibited, small though it
was.</p>

<p>Previous to the exposition this bureau was under the superintendency of Prof.
R. B. Owens of Lincoln, who labored diligently to secure a large exhibit.The
outbreak of the Spanish-American war had the effect of deterring many exhibits
that had been arranged for, but notwithstanding the disappointment thus
occasioned, the exhibit as a whole has been almost unanimously pronounced as
equal if not superior to any heretofore made.Owing to personal reasons, the
superintendent Mr. Owens, resigned in September and the work evolved upon this
Bureau.From the Excellent nucleus formed by Supt. Owens, it was not a hard
matter to complete the section.</p>

<p>The exhibits in this section were comprehensive and instructive.The new power
was shown in all its stages from the old glass disk for the generation of
frictional electricity, with its necessary adjunct, the Leyden Jar, down to the
mammoth dynamo of the present day, through all its various changes and
developments; from the old Morse telegraph instrument down to the multiplex in
use to day; the electric light from the old original "Hudson light" of 1845
down to the improved arc and incandescent lights.</p>

<p>One exhibitor had a fully equipped experimental electric table, where the
mysterious vagaries of the subtle current was hourly illustrated.It showed
the formation and exemplified the thunder and lightning, its powers of
attraction and repulsion, its power as a substitute for explosives in
projecting missiles and many other curious things.It is through just such
experiments that the expert electrician evolves the primary principles of great
inventions.</p>

<p>Among notable exhibits were the original Edison Electric light dynamo, the "X"
Ray, a display of dynamos ranging from 1/16 to 1000 horse power, an historical
exhibit of the telephone, showing its development from the first device in use
during the experimental stage down to the present efficient appliances, a
similar exhibit of telegraphy, a form of deep sea electric communication, the
improved system of underground wiring, the application of electric heat and
power, devices for controlling and measuring electricity and a host of other
paraphernalia.</p>

<p>The exhibit in this section as a whole gave to the visitor a pretty thorough
idea of the perfect control under which this great power is held by mankind and
how subservient it has been made to his wishes and demands.</p>

<p>Among the curious things on exhibition in the building were two diminutive
steam engines.One of these could be placed with ease inside of an ordinary
small sized pistol cartridge.It was a complete horizontal engine, in perfect
running order and until some of the delicately adjusted connections were broken
by an inquisitive visitor, it gave hourly exhibitions.The other was a
complete boiler and engine.This made its own steam and would run for nearly
twenty minutes with twenty drops of water.</p>

<p>The available space in this building was for machinery, 14,404 feet floor
space, gallery 7,500.Electricity 13,620 feet floor space, gallery 7,500 feet,
a total of 28,024 feet floor space and 15,000 feet in gallery.</p>

<p>The floor space was all taken with the exception of a very small space near the
northwest corner and a similar space in the southwest corner.No exhibits were
put in the gallery, that not being a fitting place for that class of exhibits.</p>

<p>POWER HOUSE.</p>

<p>This was the very heart of the Exposition, that sent the life giving power
through its veins of copper wire to every portion of the grounds, giving light
and life to the enterprise.The great battery of massive tubular boilers,
capable of transforming tons of water into steam hourly and furnishing the
motive power for the great engines that worked incessantly, day and night.The
generation of both power and light in this building was fraught with the
greatest interest and was the objective point of nearly every one that passed
through the gates.The heavier machinery was exhibited here in active
operation.From the beginning of May until the middle of November at no time
was the machinery still, the work never ceased.It speaks well for the plant
when it can be said that not a single accident occurred during the entire
season.</p>

<p>The principal machinery in use was placed as exhibits and consisted of Corliss
horizontal and upright engines, powerful dynamos, electric appliances, steam
pumps, injector valves, steam traps, steam pipes and coverings, belting, etc.
etc.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF

MANUFACTURES AND INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITS.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>Mr. H. B. Hardt, Superintendent.</p>

<p>The exhibits in Manufactures Building, were not only the best of their kinds
but they were grouped and placed to present a most harmonious whole and the
benefit to an exposition of a superintendent who possessed not only the general
and technical knowledge of the exhibits belonging in his department but also an
experience in Exposition work, qualifying him for the greater work from a show
point of view of so planning the placing, grouping and ensemble of the
completed exhibits as to present the strongest attractions to the visitors and
arresting and holding their attention, gaining later the careful and
painstaking inquiry and research which alone gives value to an exhibitor.Such
a man was the superintendent of this Bureau, and whose report on this branch of
the exhibits is as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. E. E. Bruce,</p>

<p>Manager.</p>

<p>Dear Sir.</p>

<p>MANUFACTURES BUILDING.This building was the central feature of the lagoon
tract, or Court of Honor, taken from the standpoint of exhibits.The exhibit
booths were by far more elaborate and costly than those in any of the other
buildings.In this building the wisdom of making a charge for space was made
patent to every one.The exhibits were more compact and the display showed
greater variety, in a small area than has been the case at previous
expositions.</p>

<p>Every bit of available space was taken up to save the extreme niches at the
east and west ends of the building, which were in fact not taken into account
as exhibit space.</p>

<p>The packing house industries were fully and elaborately represented, all the
products of the packing house being shown to far greater advantage than had
ever been done previously.The system of refrigeration of meats was shown a
novel and attractive manner.An octagonal refrigerator, twenty feet in its
smallest diameter with an extreme height of thirty feet, with immense doubled
plate glass sides was mounted on a circular track at its inner circumference,
and was made to revolved slowly around its axis by a system of powerful cogs
impelled by electricity.The interior was most tastefully arranged with
tempting meats, lards, hams, bacons, etc. etc. and the general effect was of a
most artistic and attractive nature.</p>

<p>Every conceivable product of the packing house was shown in lavish abundance,
and while there were not two firms adopted the same style of exhibit, all were
in the most excellent taste.One of the noteworthy booths was constructed
entirely from canned meats and the effect was not only novel and pleasing but
artistic in conception and design.The entire meat and packing house exhibit
proved to be a surprise and source of wonder to the visitor, while the
instructive feature of the exhibit from an educational point of view was
successful beyond all expectation.It taught him the extent of the industry
and brought him to the realization of the full extent to which he is dependent
upon the packer for many of the necessaries of life.That this industry was
also of necessity to the artisan, physician and manufacturer as well.</p>

<p>A very substantial pavilion was erected in the center of the building at which
one of the principal manufacturers of chocolate and cocoa gave free samples of
his product.From the upper floor of this booth, which represented a sumptuous
roof garden, many of the concerts were given by such organization as furnished
the music for the exposition.</p>

<p>This building contained a varied and interesting class of exhibits, many of
which were in full operation.A fully equipped factory for the making of
furnishing goods, turned out an immense amount of work daily.The cutting of
the garments was done by the agency of a new device, known as an electric
cutter.</p>

<p>Practical cookery was shown to better instruct the visitor the true value of
baking powders, yeasts, gelatins, etc. etc., stoves, ranges, furnaces and ovens
were fully represented.One enterprising firm, whose stove pipe has attained a
world-wide reputation, erected a very handsome booth out of the product of
their planished iron.Illuminating, lubricating and painter's oils were
abundantly in evidence.Choice cut glass, silver ware, garnet jewelry,
magnificent exhibits in ecclesiastical art goods:linen from Belfast, silks
from the Orient, furs from the Russias, woolens from Australia and Thibet,
embroideries, art lingerie, sewing machines, furnishings for both sexes, young
and old, pure foods, leather goods, sadlery and harness in process of
manufacture, harness tools, oriental carvings and art work, footwear of all
descriptions, ancient and modern, from all parts of the world, toilet and
laundry soaps, perfumes, confections, cutlery, etc. etc. made together a
display that will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>With all the different interests here represented, and the multiplicity of
ideas and tastes in decorative effect, the combination was exceedingly
harmonious.There were no obtrusive colors or outer designs that deteriorated
in any degree, from the general beauty.</p>

<p>The total available space in this building for exhibition purposes was 49,669
feet, gallery 19,884 feet.All of which was occupied.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL HALL.</p>

<p>This building, made a necessity from the great number of applications for
space, was devoted to the foreign exhibits and to the concessionaires in
foreign goods and souvenirs.Two international government exhibits, Canada and
Mexico, were installed in International Hall in their entirety.The French
exhibitors, through a commissioner, also made a very fine display.Not a
single foot of space was left vacant, and in some places encroachments were
made on the aisles.</p>

<p>Early in the Exposition, this building became the Mecca for visitors, for in it
were all the beautiful articles of vertu and home and personal adornment of the
exposition, as well as all the foreign bonded exhibits.</p>

<p>Mexico's silk, linen and lace, minerals, onyx, turquoise, gems, etc. quaint
statuary and figure work, tobacco, cigars, cigarros, cigarettes, etc. etc. 
Canada's mineral, forestry agricultural and horticultural display.France's
exquisite furniture, bisque, bronze, and French clay statues, Sevres vases,
carvings in bone and ivory, lorgnettes and opera glasses, perfumes, Limoges
ware, French bric-a-brac, exquisite laces, tapestries, draperies, etc. etc. 
Sweden, with its quaintly designed rugs and tapestries, its punch, etc.Italy
with her beautiful cameos, marble statuary, mosaics, marjolica, bas-reliefs,
tortoise shell creations.The silver filigree and daintily carved vinaigrettes
and chatelaines of the far East, the quaint jewelry and ornaments from the
Nile, novelties from Austria, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, China, Japan and
nearly every quarter of the Globe, were in bewildering abundance.It was a
busy mart at all times and many of the visitors carried away valuable souvenirs
of the great Trans-Mississippi from the International Hall.</p>

<p>The available space in this building was 18,583 feet.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF LIBERAL ARTS.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frances M. Ford, Superintendent.</p>

<p>Liberal Arts is a broad and comprehensive term, covering a broad scope of
exhibits, which are in the case of this exposition, treated separately,
therefore, in considering the Liberal Arts Exhibits this should be remembered
and Liberal Arts and Bureau of Education should be considered as one unit in
the whole system of exhibits.In the original plan of Exhibits Department,
Liberal Arts, as such had no place, it came as an after arrangement and hence,
had not that general position and importance that would otherwise have attached
to it.</p>

<p>The Liberal Arts Building, as heretofore stated, was necessarily an after
consideration, but vied with the others in point of exhibits and interest.To
the observant visitor, much information of value was obtainable.Unconsciously
the mind would revert to the past and wonder how our ancestors managed to exist
without the agents of our advanced civilization, which were everywhere
apparent.The typewriters, arithmetical machines that would add columns of any
length, automatically, without possibility of error; the modern systems of
education, as evidenced by the colleges of the present; the improved
educational appliances in maps, globes, charts and text books; the photographic
exhibits; the records of the human voice, reproduced for the entertainment of
thousands through the agency of a bit of thin metal, a little wax and a few
revolving wheels,- pianos, organs, small stringed instruments, furs, from
far-off Siberia, the extreme north, darkest Africa, and in fact from every part
of the known world; stoneware for the more ordinary uses of the household and
ornamental porcelains of elaborate finish for the wealthy, furniture of quaint
and useful design and exquisite finish, not only for the home, but for the
office as well; draperies and laces of exquisite beauty, jewelry and
bric-a-brac from all countries of the world, were there in profusion.The
triumphs of chemistry and pharmaceutical preparations were well represented as
well as, also perfumes and articles for the toilet. Refrigerators, heating and
cooking stoves and all the utensils demanded by the art of household economy,
formed a pleasing feature.</p>

<p>An exhibit, occupying nearly one-fourth of the central part of the eastern
portion of the building, was occupied by one of the principal commercial
museums of the country, showing the agrarian products of the world, while the
fibre exhibit of the United States Government attracted a large number of
visitors.</p>

<p>A number of exhibits of incubators and brooders in active operation, were also
much visited, and many of the little chicks were carried away as souvenirs. 
Altogether the Liberal Arts Building with its varied exhibits and many
tastefully decorated booths presented a cheerful aspect and was thronged with
visitors throughout the season.</p>

<p>The total available space in this building was 46,128 square feet and was
nearly all occupied, but a small portion of the gallery being vacant.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF
MACHINERY AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.</p>

<p>D. H. Elliott, Superintendent.</p>

<p>The building for housing these exhibits was situated on what was designated the
North Tract, the northern part of the grounds, and with the Dairy and Bee
Buildings and live stock pens and shed constituted the exhibit section of that
portion of the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliot's report on work of this Bureau was as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. E. E. Bruce,</p>

<p>Manager Exhibits Dept of the

T. M. &amp; I. E., Omaha, Nebr.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>On October 2nd, 1897, I was commissioned as "Special Commissioner
Transportation Exhibits" by the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition. 
I immediately opened negotiations by correspondence and personal interviews
with all the leading Transportation Companies in the United States and Canada,
soliciting exhibits; as also, later the manufacturers of agricultural
implements, in fact everything on wheels or as appertaining to this department. 
Also visited the Exposition at Nashville, Tenn. and interviewed all the
exhibitors in the Transportation building.</p> 

<p>Had promises from the "Field Museum on World's Fair Grounds" Chicago, and
others for the use of many articles and models illustrating the progress and
development of transportation facilities in the United States, as also from
railway companies, articles illustrating ancient methods.</p>

<p>The delay in decision as to size and character of the building to be
constructed for transportation and agricultural implements, defeated the idea
of making this historical exhibit.</p>

<p>Hence, all the space was utilized for display of modern and practical
implements and conveyances.The delay in the plans of the building mitigated
somewhat against an early application for space, but as finally decided upon,
offered one of the best designs and buildings for the purpose yet constructed. 
432 feet long, 300 feet wide, floored, roofed and exceedingly well lighted
having no dark spaces within it, enabling the exhibitors to install one of the
best displays of agricultural implements ever made.Four railway tracks within
the building enabled a delivery of the implements and machinery by cars within
this building, and the 1728 feet of track was later filled with a variety of
locomotives, rolling stock and railway appliances.Among them the Pullman
Palace Car Co.'s "Vestibule Train", through which, it may be interesting to
know, there passed during the Exposition 520,000 people.</p>

<p>The hours for opening the Transportation &amp; Agricultural Implement Building was
8 A.M., closing at 6:30 P.M.Visitors expressed the belief that the
Transportation &amp; Agricultural Implement Building and contents was second only
to the Government Building in interest and popularity with the public.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Exposition the location of the building was considered
to be too far away from the other main buildings, but later on, as the Indian
Congress progressed and installation of Dairy, Apiary and Live-stock exhibits
were made in that section of the grounds, the exhibitors had no cause of
complaint for want of attendance.Within this building 59,158 square feet of
space was sold to and occupied by 151 exhibitors.The Exhibit was installed,
maintained and removed, without loss, or accident to visitors, exhibitors or
exhibits.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>(Signed)D. H. Elliott,</p>

<p>BUREAU OF AWARDS.</p>

<p>James M. Woolworth, Omaha, Chairman.</p>
<p>John E. Utt, Omaha, Assistant Chairman.</p>
<p>E. E. Bruce, Omaha, Mgr. Dept. of Exhibits.</p>

<p>In the organization of the Bureau of Awards it was planned to give the widest
latitude to exhibitors in the selection of the jury, and in the matter of
adjudication to proceed with the utmost fairness and impartiality.The
Committee on Awards was composed of J. M. Woolworth, Chairman, John E. Utt,
Esq. Assistant Chairman and E. E. Bruce, manager of the Exhibits Department.</p> 

<p>A circular was prepared and sent to all the exhibitors with the request that
each should name some man as a juror, who was not only competent but whose
decisions would carry weight and credence; these jurors to prepare their
findings and deliver same to the Committee on Awards for final action.From
the names so suggested the following jurors were selected.</p>

<p>The above jurors were divided into juries of three and given different
groupings to pass upon.The following rules for the government of the jury
work, were approved after carefully taking into full consideration the plans
for such work adopted and put in practice at other expositions.Many of the
features formerly used were either entirely eliminated or modified to met the
exigencies of the present situation, and every precaution was taken to guard
against the possibility of fraudulent action on the part of any one, one part
of the system checking against the other.The jury worked diligently and
faithfully and did their work in a thorough and efficient manner, earning for
themselves, as a body the reputation of being one of the ablest juries ever
called together at an Exposition.Out of Five thousand one hundred and
nineteen separate exhibits, only thirty appeals were made from the jury
findings.This is an unprecedented record in jury work, and the ladies and
gentlemen who served at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition as
jurors, have every reason to feel a sense of satisfaction at the reception
their recommendations met at the hands of the exhibitors.</p>

<p>From the recommendations of the jury there were awarded medals and diplomas as

<p>DEPARTMENT OF EXHIBITS.</p>

<p>EDWARD E. BRUCE, Manager.</p>

<p>H. B. Hardt, Assistant.</p>

<p>The Exhibits, of all form, nature and character, are calculated to be the main attraction of an Exposition, and hence much thought, care and attention is necessary that the exhibits, whether considered singly or as a whole, shall be of such character as to not only compel the attention of the visitors but to enlist their interest in the qualities, nature and operation of them, so it follows that the most successful exhibits are those which most generally attracts the sympathy and inquiry of the exposition patrons.</p>

<p>It is a matter of much pride to the exposition management, that the exhibits as
secured, arranged and grouped, excited so much favorable commendation from
those whose long and varied experience in exposition work, qualified them as
competent judges in such matters.</p>

<p>It is but fair to state that the general high quality of the exhibits in this
exposition is due mainly to Manager Bruce of the department, and to his able
assistant, Mr. Hardt; and is also due to the general high character and
efficiency of the superintendents of the various branches of this department,
selected by Manager Bruce for their special qualifications and fitness for the
work placed in their charge.</p>

<p>To the fine business ability and the excellent judgment evidenced by the
manager of this department is attributed, mainly the results obtained.</p>

<p>The operations and results of this department, in so far as they can be given
at this late day, may be stated in the following way.</p>

<p>The first thought of the department management was given to its organization
and to preparation of rules governing exhibits and exhibitors.To this end
Manager Bruce, Manager Reed and the general secretary, as a committee carefully
considered the subject of rules and form of application etc., noting the action
of similar projects and considering their fitness in this case.As a result of
the committee's consideration and conclusions on the subject the following
Rules were recommended and were by them adopted.</p>

<p>(Insert General Rules and Regulations 7 pages typewritten, next attached.)</p>


<p>Manager Bruce divided the work of the Exhibits Department into branches,
designated Bureaus, as follows:</p>

<p>Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>Bureau of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>Bureau of Mines and Mining.</p>
<p>Bureau of Agriculture, Horticulture, Forestry and Irrigation.</p>
<p>Bureau of Live Stock.</p>
<p>Bureau of Diary Products.</p>
<p>Bureau of Poultry.</p>
<p>Bureau of Bee Industries.</p>
<p>Bureau of Machinery and Electricity.</p>
<p>Bureau of Manufactures and International Exhibits.</p>
<p>Bureau of Liberal Arts</p>
<p>Bureau of Transportation and Agricultural Implements.</p>

<p>The operations under these various bureaus, as gathered from reports of chief

following divisions.</p>

coaches on their own wheelswill be $5 each and locomotives with tenders, $10
each.The minimum charge of 50 cents for any single shipment will be exacted
by the Exposition authorities, and the minimum carload weight as established by
the initial road will be the basis on which the Exposition charge is made for
such car load shipments, and exhibits weighing more than 2,000 pounds, each
piece will be subject to special arrangements.Such goods as are received at
the Exposition with transportation and terminal charges unpaid or only
partially paid will be stored at the expense and risk of the owner.</p>

<p>Rule 35.The buildings and grounds will be illuminated generally. Should any
exhibitor require extra light, he can obtain same upon application and on
payment of fixed rates.</p>

<p>Rule 36.Before March 1st, 1898, Representatives of Commissions should furnish
the Chief of Department of Exhibits with approximate plans showing the manner
they intend to group their display and furnish a list of exhibitors together
with the individual application forms for spaces for the preparation of the
general plans and official catalogue.</p>

<p>Rule 37.Such Representatives of Commissions, as may be designated shall be
permitted to act as such representatives, provided they are duly accredited and
produce to the Exposition authorities written evidence of having been
authorized to act by the Proper.</p>

<p>Rule 38.Immediately after the close of the Exposition, exhibitors must remove
their effects and complete such removal within 30 days from the closing.Goods
then remaining will be chargedstorage.</p>

<p>Rule 39.Loan exhibits accepted by the Chief of the Department of Exhibits

madein each case for exhibits which are non-commercial in character, but
designed to add to the completeness and educational value of the exposition.</p>

<p>Rule 41.Exhibitors furnishing machinery such as engines, boilers, etc. for
use of the Exposition, may select their own men to operate them.Their wages
will be fixed and paid by the Exposition authorities.</p>

<p>Rule 42.The Exposition authorities will defray the necessary expenses of
exhibitors who loan their machine tools, etc. for the use of the Exposition,
beyond the outlay they would have incurred as exhibitors, simple wear and tear
expected.</p>

<p>Rule 43.Permits will be issued by the Chief of the Department of Exhibits to
bring in such material as may be required for the successful operation of
certain exhibits and such articles as may be required by concessionaires and
privilege holders fifteen minutes before the opening of the expositionin the
morning, also for the removal of such articles and products as come within the
general rules and regulations.</p>

<p>Rule 44.The escape of steam into the atmosphere will not be permitted in any
of the buildings and the exhibitor must provide care of its condensation.</p>

<p>Rule 45.It is not intended that machinery shall be installed in any other

the approval of the Chief of the Department of Exhibits.</p>

<p>Rule 46.Works of art will be admitted to the fine arts section, whether
previously exhibited or not.All works of art must be of highest order or
merit and will be admitted on approval of the Committee of Selection.The

<p>Rule 47.Each person who becomes an exhibitor thereby agrees to conform
strictly to all the rules and regulations established for the government of the
Exposition.</p>

<p>Rule 48.The Exposition authorities of the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition reserve to themselves the right to construe, amend or add to these
rules and regulations whenever it may be deemed necessary for the interest of
the Exposition.</p>

<p>The Exposition authorities hope to secure such perfection of detail in the
presentation of each separate exhibit and such logical, consistent and
harmonious combination in the arrangement of the several classes and groups as
will secure a display which will be both instructive and artistic.To this end
they desire to aid exhibitors and to secure their hearty co-operation and
assistance.Regulations are intended not to annoy exhibitors but to aid them
in making the most effective display.</p>

<p>CONCESSIONS &amp; PRIVILEGES DEPARTMENT</p>

<p>Abraham L. Reed, Manager</p>

<p>E.M. Fairfield, Chief Clerk</p>
<p>Olin West, Chief of Inspectors</p>

<p>"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."</p>

<p>The best Expositions are places of instruction, interest and amusement.As no
school of instruction and training is complete without its play grounds and its
games, so no Exposition school of learning is complete without its play
grounds, its places of amusements, recreation and frolic.It only remains, as
with other schools of instruction, to so surround the features provided for the
play grounds with such rules and regulations as will be calculated to restrain
the fun and frolic within proper and reasonable limits.It also follows that,
as with other schools of learning, the operators of amusement features and the
frolicsome visitors will sometimes set all rules and regulations at naught and
have for their guidance this only-
"On with the dance, let Joy be unconfined."
It is true, however, that it is but seldom that the authorities of the
amusement section fail to maintain a firm and even control over the operations
of features and the conduct of the patrons.The fun and frolic of an
Exposition is not, however, the chief element of the Concessions Department. 
The matter of providing food and drink for Exposition visitors and its small
army of employees, the privilege to sell all sorts of articles and to pursue
all sorts of avocations.The very many pursuits in which money passes, are all
the subjects of negotiation with and are operated under rights granted by the
Concessions Department.</p>

<p>The applications for these many concessions and Privileges are generally
somewhat plentiful and the management of the Department is called upon to very
carefully consider the proposals, their purposes, their proposed manner of
operation and the multitude of detail involved in their presentation, so that
the Exposition shall not be imposed upon, nor the patrons of the Exposition
have just cause for complaint upon any legitimate cause or basis.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the management of concessions department is not
simple.Also, that in spite of careful consideration, constant watchfulness
and unceasing surveillance, there will creep in things that should not be, and
which are not highly creditable.The stringent regulations and constant
oversight, however, minimizes the opportunity for unseemly and indecorous
operations and actions.</p>

<p>A large Exposition is not only full of instruction for the onlookers but is a
most liberal education for all who have to do with its management and daily
routine.In no other department is this education more diverse and
comprehensive than in that of concessions.When one considers that 90 out
every 100 concessioners are regular followers of Expositions, who not only
represent the native craft and cunning of twenty different peoples, but come
with wits sharpened against other, perhaps many other, Concessions Departments,
the mere making of the hundreds of contracts, whose terms shall not conflict,
is seen to be a task calling for the aptest of pupil.</p>

<p>So also in the daily and hourly enforcement of the contracts, particularly
those governing the operation of amusement concessions of the "Midway", are
those lessons to be read and digested, and that instantly.No long hours of
study can here be permitted;it is not a place for the student but for the man
of discriminating insight and quick decision.When dispute arise, when
collections of deferred payments or daily percentages are sought to be evaded,
when a Babel of tongues engulfs the officers of the department, when the guards
are met with a show of armed resistance at the Indian camp or threats to
unleash the lions in the "Animal Show", then it is that one wishes his
"education" were not all crowded into a few short months.</p>

<p>The T.M. &amp; I.E. was fortunate in having the experienced assistance of a
superintendent and a chief Inspector in the Concessions Department, who had
served apprenticeship at the Nashville Exposition the year before and who
therefore had personal knowledge of most of the concessionaires and their
peculiarities.This knowledge was invaluable, and it is all but essential to
the success of any Concessions Department that its executive officer should
have had previous experience.</p>

<p>One of the rocks which dot the course of this department is the grant of
"exclusive" privileges, and the navigator who would avoid wreck thereon must be
well up in the psychologic ethnologic and diabolic branches of Exposition
knowledge.Whether a certain costume is Syrian or Greek, whether a "wedding
procession" is Egyptian of Maltese, whether camels are permanently attached to
the land of the Pyramids, or may safely be assumed to have use in other
countries, whether Algiers is any more "Oriental" than Italy or whether
"oriental" has a technical, specialized, Expositionized meaning, from these
International problems down to the question of how long it takes to transform a
"hot roast sandwich" into a cold one and thereby change its contractual
habitat, for the proper determination of these and innumerable other vexatious
questions, the department needs nothing less than Omniscience.</p>

<p>Happy the manager who can see the light often enough to correct his reckoning
and steer safely between the Scylla of lost revenue and the Charydbis of legal
complication.He must assume infallibility if he have it not; and if some of
his judgment are reversed by the courts, he is always to be congratulated that
the reversals are no more numerous.</p>

<p>It is with confidence that the assertion is made that the amusement section of
the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition was more free from anything
objectionable or indecorous than any previous American Exposition of magnitude. 
And that this is so is attributable manly to the care, study, investigation and
manly decision of the Manager of this Department, whose every aim was toward a
successful and a credible operation of the department placed under his care and
management.</p>

<p>It is always expected that the Concessions Department shall be productive of
large revenues to the Exposition, and sometimes it is revenue only that is
planned to result.In this Exposition it was planned to have a successful and
credible operation of this department, with as large net revenue as would there
by result.</p>

<p>In the consideration of rights for sale of beer and wines in connection with
restaurants, etc. it was decided that while it was clear such rights must be
granted, yet it should be within proper regulations and the sale of such goods
by the use of open bars or otherwise should not be offensively thrust on the
notice of Exposition patrons.This decision was duly carried out.The sale of
whiskey and liquors was not allowed under any concession granted, and the
troubles of the management by reason of the sale of intoxicants were slight.</p>

<p>The revenues of the Exposition, coming to it from the Concessions Department,
were of most material advantage.Those receipts prior to the opening of the
Exposition and during its first months, having special value, owing to demands
of creditors, whose clamor could only be satisfied with cash, and some
concessions perhaps, were granted for a less consideration than could otherwise
have been secured because of the crying need for funds.</p>

<p>The receipts of the Concessions department show that for each admission to the
Exposition, paid and free, the Concessions Department received 14-7/10 cents. 
And for each Paid admission to the Exposition grounds the Concessions
Department received 16-53/100 cents, a record that stands unmatched by any
previous American Exposition of magnitude.</p>

<p>To show fully the concessions granted, their character receipts, the revenue to
the Exposition from each, the receipts daily from each class of concessions,
together with a summary of the financial transactions of the department, the
subjoined statements are given.</p>

<p>Next follows classified abstract showing gross receipts of the various
concessions, etc.Said abstract is too long and too complex for typewriting.</p>

<p>My dear Wakefield:</p>

<p>I return with this the copy for the Trans-Mississippi History enclosed with
yours of the 5th.You will note I have made a few corrections that will
eliminate giving the Mo. Pacific prominent notice as against the other Omaha
terminal roads.</p>

<p>Also note what you say about the medals.I cannot help but think that your
proposition is very nice and Mr. Wattles who was just in and I mentioned the
matter to him, and will add that if the meeting can be held the fore part of
next week I will take pleasure in being there, in fact will make a special
effort to be there at any subsequent date if advised.</p>

<p>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT</p>

<p>Mr. William N. Babcock, Manager</p>

<p>Ambrose H. Lee, Superintendent</p>

<p>The duties pertaining to this department are well set forth in the Executive
Committee rules as to transportation.The most important of these were the
securing and promulgating of special and highly favorable rates on all the
railroad and steamship lines, for exhibits, etc., destined for and to the
Exposition, and the negotiations for and publication of special railway rates
for Exposition visitors.</p>

<p>Railway companies viewed the exposition with favor, and it may be said that no
reasonable requests upon the railways for assistance were ever declined. 
Through their courtesy, the Exposition management was enabled to send its
agents and representatives to various parts of this country, often in special
cars and trains, promoting the advantages of the exposition and traveling in
its interests.</p>

<p>Foreign railroads and steamship companies also assisted materially.Exhibits
from the Orient, European, South American and other countries were transported
to and from the Exposition at greatly reduced rates.Foreign exhibits, by Act
of Congress, were admitted to out ports free of payment of duties.Import
brokers at ports of entry assumed the duty of clearing the exhibit shipments
free of expense to the exhibitor.These courtesies were much appreciated.</p>

<p>Domestic exhibits were transported, to and from the exposition on reduced
rated, full rates to the Exposition and return rates free on certificate that
goods had been exhibited and had not changed ownership.In many instances
exhibits from Nebraska and adjourning states were carried free.</p>

<p>Through a contract made by the Exposition with one of the Omaha Terminal
Railway companies, that company laid a system of railway tracks within the
grounds, which tracks were available to all Terminal Railways, which permitted
the placing of cars at the doors of all of the principal buildings.These
tracks were covered during the period the exposition was held, then uncovered
and used again for the removal of the exhibits.Under this contract a charge
of $4.00 per car load was made upon all car loads of exhibits or other goods
going into the exposition grounds in railway cars.Main lines of Terminal
Railways ran alongside the grounds on the north and with side tracks at that
point, in conjunction with some tracks just inside the grounds, afforded
excellent positions for placing and holding the special cars and trains of
visiting persons and parties.</p>

<p>During the period of the exposition the railway companies made and put in
effect special excursion rates that were generally very liberal.And this
fact, together with the extensive advertising of the Exposition by the various
railway lines, contributed largely to the success which resulted.</p>

<p>The Omaha Street Railway Co. gave a car service which was generally ample and
very satisfactory.Better than a one-minute service was given, and on three of
the big days an average of 242,617 passengers were carried.</p>

<p>The matter of caring for and storing the empty packages used for exhibits etc. 
was awarded under contract to the Exposition Transfer Co., to remove all
packing boxes, crated, etc., from the grounds, store them, return them to the
exhibit spaces at close of the exposition for the compensation of four and
one-half (4-1/2) cents per cubic foot; they to care for and store the packages
of the Exposition itself, including those pertaining to the Fine Arts Exhibits,
free of cost to the Exposition.</p>

<p>Handling of freight pertaining to exhibits was done by the Exposition Transfer
Co. under a contract with the Exposition providing for charges of six cents per
cwt. from cars and from freight house on the grounds, and twelve per cwt. from
down depots and terminals to the designated exhibit spaces in the buildings
with a minimum charge or 50 cents per single package, they agreeing to
establish and maintain, without expense to the Exposition, an office and forces for the keeping of all goods received and shipped.These important services were so well performed that not a single loss or damage claim against the Exposition resulted.These were handled in this way 5,417 consignments, consisting of 127,749 packages, weighing 21,205,457 pounds, or 10,603 tons, or 1,000 car loads of ten tons each.</p>

<p>The same regulations and charges governed the removal of exhibits, etc. as obtained for their receipt.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT</p>

<p>DAILY PROGRAMMES - SPECIAL DAYS</p>

<p>Official Entertainment</p>

<p>Under the original organization of the Exposition, the president performed the
duties which, under the reorganization, we assigned to the several members of
the executive committee. During the period of exploitation, he visited with
delegations of prominent citizens many of the Trans-Mississippi states,
promoting appropriations from legislatures and arousing pubic interest.This
work was continued after the re-organization an until the gates were opened.</p>

<p>The most notable of these journeys was taken in February 1897, with a
delegation composed of President Wattles, G.M. Hitchcock, John L. Webster, W.S.
Poppleton, Clement Chase and H.E. Palmer, who, with their wives, were tendered
a private car by the Pullman Company, and transported without cost by the Union
Pacific and other railroads to the capitals of nine different western states. 
In nearly every one of these states, this delegation was given a hearing before
a joint session of the legislature, and while on account of the hard times then
prevailing some of these states did not make appropriations, there is no doubt
but the interest aroused did much to advertise the Exposition and later on to
increase its attendance.</p>

<p>In addition to this work numerous delegations were invited to Omaha and
entertained during the period of building the Exposition.In the winter of
1897-1898 these visitors came thick and fast.In January the entire Iowa
legislature were invited and transported from Des Moines free of expense. 
After a visit to the Exposition grounds they were entertained at a dinner at
the Millard Hotel at which many toasts were given and much good will prevailed.</p>

<p>On July 28, 1897, the executive committee defined the duties of the president
as follows:The president of the Exposition with such assistants as he may
deem necessary shall have charge of the official entertainment of distinguished
visitors, the reception and welcoming of visiting commissions and delegations,
the arrangements in connection with special days and arrangement and publicity
of the daily programme of events and features of the Exposition.</p>

<p>LAYING OF THE CORNER STONE

of the

ARCH OF STATES - ARBOR DAY</p>

<p>April 22, 1897.</p>

<p>The first occasion for a ceremonial was the laying of the corner-stone of the
Arch of States Entrance, which was at that time planned to be a permanent
structure built of stone from each of the Trans-Mississippi states and
territories.The corner-stonewas laid on Arbor Day, the tree-planting state
holiday in Nebraska, with appropriate Masonic ceremonies.The day was fine and
warm, a bright sun following the rain of the previous night, regarded as a good
omen.
A parade was formed on Farnam Street, and moved shortly after one o'clock p.m.
in the following order:</p>

<p>SIXTH DIVISION.</p>
<p>Private Citizens in Carriages.</p>

<p>Reaching the site of the Arch of States at 20th &amp; Pinckney streets at 2:30 P.M.
the Masonic Grand Lodge of Nebraska marched between the long lines of the
paraders to the platform where the exercises were to take place.A great
concourse of people had assembled, it was a city holiday.
Masonic Grand master Chas. J. Phelps conducted the ceremonies, assisted by
Deputy Grand master J.B. Dinsmore, Grand Secretary W. R. Bowen, Grand Treasurer
Christian Hartman, Grand Senior Warden F. H. Young, Acting Grand Junior Warden,
George W. Lininger.The wine and oil used for the ceremony was brought
personally from Jerusalem by past Grand Master G. W. Lininger of Omaha. The
stone was inscribed "Laid by the Masonic Fraternity, April 22, 1897, N.W.
Charles J. Phelps, G.M."At the conclusion of the services the Grand Master
delivered the implement of the profession of builders to Architect in-chief,
Thomas R. Kimball, exhorting him to supervise well the construction of the
buildings, and then announced that the cornerstone had been well laid and in
all due form.</p>

<p>The president of the Exposition then formally introduced the various speakers
of the day.Addresses were delivered by Hon. William J. Broatch, Mayor of the
City of Omaha, Lieut. Governor __ __ __ Harris of Nebraska, and the Honorable
J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska City, Nebraska, ex-Secretary of Agriculture of
the United States.Mr. Morton's address was as follows:</p>

<p>In the wisdom of His creative majesty the great Mysteriarch of the universe
surrounded man with mysteries.Without such environment there would have been
no incentive to thought, no inducement to investigation.The life and growth
of a blade of grass, the development of a rose, or the evolution of a great oak
from an acorn alike suggests the unknown, the miraculous and the unsolved.</p>

<p>In 1854 the pioneers of Nebraska made the first lodgment of modern civilization
upon the vast, undulating ocean of fertile lands which stretched in solitude
from the west bank of the Missouri River toward the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>At the point of the plow they have compelled the prairies of Nebraska to
deliver up, during the last forty-one years, thirty-six abundant crops, some of
them almost miraculous in yield.During that period of time, in remote
frontier portions of the commonwealth, there have been some failures or partial
failures, of crops from drouth and from grasshoppers.But in the eastern
portion of Nebraska, there may be found hundreds of farms which, since 1855
have never once failed to remunerate intelligent tillage with substantial
rewards.The men who legitimately, steadfastly and discreetly have trusted to
the plow and intelligent farming in the first settled sections of Nebraska
since 1885 are, as a rule, successful men, not mortgaged nor in financial
straits.There is no part of the United States which can exhibit from its
first cultivation a crop record equal in annual yield to that which eastern
Nebraska is proud to exhibit from the day when agriculture first put its
autograph upon the prairie with the point of the plow, down to the autumn of
1896 when the sun shone and the winds played among the cornfields in this
commonwealth, which produced more than 200,000,000 of bushels.Nebraska is
prepared with statistics, figures and facts to prove that during the last forty
years no state in the union has surpassed it in the regularity and abundance of
its crops.Thus far, however, we have only demonstrated that the elements of
plant life and growth, which were primarily absorbed by the wild grasses and
flowers, are not appropriated and utilized by corn, oats, barley, rye, wheat
and a variety of root and other food crops.The summer and autumn sunlight
which formerly only bronzed prairie grass now gilds the grain fields, burnishes
ripening fruit and matures ample rewards in varied products for intelligent
toil.</p>

<p>HISTORY OF ARBOR DAY.</p>

<p>But after the demonstration of the plow as to the fertility of Nebraska another
problem demanded solution.The home builders in this new country desired the
embellishment of the plains by woodlands and forests, and the question as to
how it should be accomplished and as to whether forests would thrive in these
soils compelled earnest and analytical investigation.Consequently, after much
experimentation, much of individual exhortation and effort, there was evolved
out of the shadeless plains and from the utter desolation of treelessness, a
plan for unanimous tree planting on a given day by all the people in all the
counties of all the commonwealth.And the plan took root like a strong and
valuable tree.Its growth today reaches out into all the states of the
American republic.It has been grafted upon the school system of the entire
country.It has been transported to European countries which are carefully
cherishing it.In Mexico, Australia, and in some of the far-a-way islands of
the oceans and seas it is permanently established as an anniversary and
everywhere it is recognized and welcomed as a child of Nebraska.</p>

<p>In all the timbered states of the east, and in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, in
fact in each of the heavily wooded sections of the United States, vast areas of
trees were unneccesarily cut down and the logs even of valuable oaks, walnuts
and other cabinet woods, thoughtlessly, uselessly transmitted to smoke and
ashes.How few of the axmen, the tree-slayers, who kindled those disastrous
conflagrations realized that the flames which they evolved were merely stolen
sunlight set free, enfranchised.the mystery of the life of a great and aged
tree is a majesty compared to which that of human royalty is tame, puerile and
insignificant.From our earliest childhood we are taught that fire and water
will not mix, but in the tree they mingle as friends and co-laborers.With its
foliage, which are its lungs, the tree breathes in the rain and the light. 
Every sunbeam which it inhales is imprisoned only to be freed by combustion. 
The water and the fire are married and dwell inter-dependently in all the
vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>DESTRUCTION OF FORESTS.</p>

<p>Like vast, disciplined armies the forests of the American continent stood guard
over the fertility of the lands and the health and lives of all the animal
creation which they protected.With their foliage of emerald and the
whispering winds, those great stretches of wooded land lured the light of the
sun, the moisture of the clouds to their hearts and made them hostages, pledges
against flood, drouth and the disease which those calamities create.But man's
wanton wastefulness of the superb woods of the United States has dried up
thousands of springs of delicious drinking water, parched out beautiful brooks
and useful mill streams, destroyed the pliant and absorbing leaf-mould of the
forest, which was the arrester and custodian of torrential rain-falls and the
mother of rills and streams.</p>

<p>Is it possible that each stratum of rocks and minerals is a grave a great tomb,
wherein myriads of centuries ago were buried the remnants of animal and
vegetable kind?When woodlands, forest trees shall have all been destroyed,
together with subsidiary vegetation, every living thing will have perished from
the face of the earth.Has this globe at some time in the unknowable,
pre-historic past subsisted a race which destroyed its forests, and then, as a
penalty perished?Is the present tenantry of this earth destined to destroy
all its forests and trees and thus commit universal suicide?The intermission
of the foliage, flower and fruit of a single summer would bring upon every
human being, upon all animal, organisms, an overwhelming avalanche of death. 
This is a stupendous truth.It admonishes mankind that their physical sanitary
protection is in the trees and forests, which conserve the rainfall, mitigate
the heat of the sun and make it possible the continuation of animal life and
the perpetuation of that civilization which exalts and ennobles the human race.</p>

<p>A truth and a tree outlive generations of men.That this admirably planned
Trans-Mississippi Exposition may plant truths as to the economic and materials
resources of its vast and opulent empire in the minds of the tens of thousands
of intelligent visitors and sojourners who may attend it, with as cheerful a
certainty and as serene a satisfaction as we experience in planting these trees
in the never-deceiving, never-disappointing soil of the fertile Nebraska, is my
earnest hope and my sincere and intense desire.</p>

<p>OPENING DAY, JUNE 1ST, 1898.</p>

<p>Some time before the day set for the formal opening of the Exposition, the
principal officials and many prominent citizens of the nation were formally
invited to attend.The invitation sent out read as follows:</p>

<p>(S E A L)
"To_____________________________
_______________________________</p>

<p>Although commemorating no single event in the history of the region lying west
of the Mississippi River, the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition
has been projected as a demonstration of the marvelous resources of the great
West.In grateful recognition of that spirit of progress, which, in the brief
period of a half century has transformed a wilderness into twenty-four states
and territories, embracing more than two-thirds the area, nearly one-half of
the wealth and one-third of the population of our country, the whole world has
been invited to participate with us in a display of the arts, industries,
manufactures and products of the soil, mine and sea.</p>

<p>The attention of civilization has been called to this display, not merely in
the spirit of emulation but in gratitude to those intrepid pioneers who bravely
faced dangers and overcame obstacles that the source of empire might not be
impeded in its westward march.It is a memorial to the indomitable courage and
perseverance of that sturdy van-guard no less than as an illustration of the
achievements of their successors, that the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition will open its gates from June 1st until November 1st, 1898.In the
name of the entire west, I most cordially invite your cooperation and request
the honor of your presence.</p>

<p>With profound respect, I am</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>
<p>Gurdon W. Wattles,</p>
<p>President."</p>

<p>Special invitations were sent to many to attend the opening exercises.</p>

<p>The day dawned bright and clear and the beautiful sunshine and balmy air were
regarded as good omens for future success.This was the day to which the
officials of the Exposition had looked with hope and courage for many weary
months, and now as they gazed at the gathering throngs and the beautiful
buildings, practically complete, and fully realized the magnitude of their
undertaking and at what sacrifices this day with all its triumphs had been, a
feeling of thankfulness and satisfaction came to one and all.With glad hearts
and smiling faces the officials entered upon the duties of the day strong in
the belief that financial success must follow the artistic success now so
clearly in evidence.</p>

<p>The opening ceremonies were planned to occur at 12 o'clock noon when the
president of the United States would by electric current set the machinery in motion and formally declare the Exposition open to the world.At 10:30 A.M. a parade was formed in the city, the right of the column resting on 16th &amp; Douglas streets, and moved in the following order:</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel J. Nichols of St. Louis, Mo., then followed, invocating as follows:</p>

<p>O, God, uncreated and eternal in Thy being, Creator and Lord of all, who dost
uphold and govern all in infinite power, wisdom, righteousness and goodness, we
lift up our hearts to Thee in adoration and praise.There is none perfect as
Thou art.We rejoice in thy sovereignty; Thy greatness is unsearchable.The
Heavens declare the glory, and the earth is full of the tokens of Thy goodness. 
Thou art the bounteous giver of all good, the fountain of all wisdom, the
spirit of all knowledge, the source of all life and happiness.We are Thy
creatures, utterly dependent upon Thee; without Thee we have no wisdom or
strength or life of our own.We are also Thy children, made in Thy image and
capable of sharing Thy life.This honor Thou hast given us and hast crowned us
with sovereignty over the earth.It is our privilege to call Thee our Father
in Heaven, unworthy and sinful as we have made ourselves, Thou has not forsaken
us, but hast by Thy Holy Spirit, given us wisdom and understanding and power. 
Thou dost inspire men with high purposes and lead them to execute good and
great designs, so, today, in this hour of finished labor, we would not glory in
ourselves, or in the work of our hands, but only in Thee, from whom came the
wisdom to devise and the power to execute.This glory of human achievement
which surrounds us in this place, and which speaks of man's skills and
industry, of progress in knowledge and increase in power over the land which
Thou hast given us for our inheritance is only a witness and a memorial of Thy
great favor toward us.When we remember the way by which Thou hast led us, and
from what to what we have come, we are moved to cry in adoring gratitude, "Thou
hast not dealt so with any nation", Thou art the God of our fathers, who didst
lead them to this western world, Thou didst keep a continent hidden until the
fullness of time came, when Thou didst throw open its gates that the people
prepared for it, and of Thy own choice, might enter in and possess the land. 
In it Thou hast lifted up the people and established a nation of freemen. 
Thine hand hast led us, marvelously in the past, and through Thy favor we are
crowned with riches and honor and might.Our eyes have seen the wonders which
Thou hast wrought in our midst, so that this day the aged among us stand amazed
when they recall the past.For all this Exposition represents, for the
transfiguration of a wilderness into fruitful fields, and an uninhabited land
into populous states, for progress in arts and manufactures, for the fruits of
the field, the riches of the vines and the abundance of the forests, for growth
in education, refinement, wealth and the comforts of life, for the supremacy of
law, the continuance of our free institutions and the bright hopes for the
future, we give Thee, O God, our most hearty and grateful thanks.

Oh, Gracious Father, whose bounty is infinite, grant now Thy blessing, we
entreat Thee, upon all who have labored for the establishment and completion of
this enterprise.May what they have done be owned by Thee in advancing and
stimulating all the arts of peace, and in promoting the progress and well being
of society.Bless the city within whose gates we have come.May peace abide
within its walls, and prosperity within its palaces.Bless the commonwealth of
Nebraska, and let Thy favor descend upon its homes, even as the rain and dews
upon its fields.Bless the governor, even as the rain and dews upon its
fields.Bless the governor of this state and all associated with him in
authority and counsel.We pray Thee also, in behalf of our common country. 
Remember Thy servant, the president of the United States, his cabinet, Thy
servants in congress assembled, and all who bear rule in the several states of
this nation, grant unto them the spirit of wisdom and counsel, strengthen them
for any good work and make them faithful in all things to Thy holy law, so that
they may lead the people in righteousness.While we pray for the land we love,
we would remember before Thee all nations and rulers, especially those who are
represented in this Exposition.Grant Thy blessing to Queen Victoria and all
her subjects, to the president of the republic of Mexico and all whom he
represents.May they be led by Thy good spirit in all things, and may peace
and good will abide and grow deeper and stronger between them and us.Oh, God
of our fathers, Ruler of nations, while we celebrate the triumph of peace, we
remember that the shadow of war is upon our land, and that the sound of
conflict smites our ears.We earnestly pray that it may please Thee speedily
to restore peace, and to hasten the day when under the reign of righteousness
and love all wars shall cease.But if, as we believe, Thou hast called us to
take the sword to avenge the wrongs of the helpless and oppressed, and to set
free our brothers from their bondage, then make us strong to serve Thee and
defend us in the day of battle.Bless the army and the navy; shield them from
all perils by land or by sea, and grant them victory, which is in Thy hand. 
Oh, gracious God, most bountiful benefactor, our hearts are this day lifted up
in hope, and Thou dost make us bold to ask the continuance of Thy favors and
larger blessings for the future.Thou hast redeemed the region in which we
dwell from savage rule, and hast given its abundance into our hands.The
wilderness, where once Thy image was defiled by ignorance and superstition, has
been filled with happy homes purified by Thy word; Thy temples stand on every
side and Thy people sing Thy praise.But surely Thou hast not brought us so
far on our way only to leave us.Abide with us; grant us more of Thy light and
truth, and make us faithful in all things to Thy holy law, so that through our
obedience to Thee, we may be known as that people where God is the Lord. 
Multiply peace and prosperity among us.Lift up the poor an cast down the
proud.Rebuke vice and oppression, cast down the wicked and defeat their
plans.Make righteousness to flourish, truth to be established, and brotherly
love to prevail in all our burdens.All this we humbly ask in the name of Him,
who has taught us to pray, saying; 'Our Father which art in Heaven; hallowed by
Thy name; Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven; give
us this day our daily bread, and forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors. 
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; for Thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.Amen.'
President Wattles' Address.</p>

<p>Prayer was followed by the address of President Wattles as follows:</p>

<p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition is a reality today only by
virtue of the pluck and energy and enterprise of the people of the country it
represents.Amid the financial depression of the greatest panic of recent
years, amid the gloom of doubt and distress which followed this panic, the
first steps were taken in this great enterprise.</p>

<p>Against the advice of many of our most conservative citizens, and the prophecy
of failure by some, the work was begun.During its early stages there were
many discouragements, but when the congress of the United States recognized the
Exposition as worthy of its encouragement and support, all doubts were
dispelled, and the people of this community, and of the entire west, rose above
the calamities of the hour and united in the work with an energy which assured
success.</p>

<p>But these beautiful grounds and buildings have not been prepared and filled with the choicest specimens of the products of the world by chance. This work represents many weary months of toil, many discouragements and vicissitudes, but a final triumph worthy of the men who have given it their best thought and energy. This, the opening day, crowns their work with an adequate reward. We see the results of their efforts in this magnificent spectacle of architectural beauty and grandeur, commanding the admiration and attention of the world.</p>

<p>This Exposition celebrated no single event in the history of the
Transmississippi country.This history for the periods of a single generation
past reveals a succession of achievements, any one of which might properly be
the subject of a great demonstration of this character.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago the larger part of the country west of the Mississippi River
was unorganized territory, and was indicated on the map as the Great American
desert.Its arid plains and unexplored mountains were occupied by savage
tribes, and there herds of antelope and buffalo roamed unmolested by the white
man, in solitude unbroken by the implements of civilization.</p>

<p>There were no railroads</p>

<p>No railroad had been constructed west of the Missouri river.But one city of
more than 50,000 population had been built west of the Mississippi.The total
population of this vast domain, comprising more than two-thirds of the area of
the United States, was less than 2,000,000 and more than three-fourths of this
population was in three states on its southeastern border.</p>

<p>The city of Omaha had not been founded.The resources on which this city
depends for its great commerce today were undeveloped. Gold had just been
discovered in California, and the march of civilization toward the west had
hardly begun.</p>

<p>Fifty years is within the memory of many here present, but what a change has
been wrought in this region.Within its borders are now twenty states and four
territories with a population of more than 20,000,000, wealth double that of
Spain and Portugal combined, and an internal commerce greater than the foreign
commerce of Germany, France and Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Great American Desert is no more.Its eastern part is covered with fertile
farms, which produced last year more than 1,000,000,000 bushels of corn and
500,000,000 bushels of wheat which, with the other agricultural products of
this section were sold for more than $1,100,000,000.The western part of this
desert now forms the pasture of the nation.On its nutritious grasses feed the
herds which supplythe meat to the markets of the world.</p>

<p>In 1850, the buffalo which roamed over this region outnumbered the cattle in
the United States.In 1895 it is estimated that there were 30,000,000 cattle
and 50,000,000 hogs and sheep west of the Mississippi river and the value of
the yearly product of these herds is $400,000,000, or nearly equal in value to
the annual output of the gold and silver mines throughout the world.</p>

<p>Nor does the grain and stock of this country comprise its only products.The
fruit and wine of California and Oregon, the forests of Washington, Minnesota
and Arkansas, the sugar of Louisiana, Utah and Nebraska, and the cotton of the
southeastern states, furnish no small part of its yearly commerce.But its
mines must not be overlooked.From them has been taken in paying quantities
every known mineral.The copper, iron and coal already discovered would supply
the markets of the world for a century to come.The surface of the mountains
and hills has hardly been prospected, but the richest and most extensive gold
and silver mines in the world have been discovered.From them has been
produced in the past fifty years more than sufficient to pay the government
debt at the close of the rebellion, and their annual output now amounts to more
than $100,000,000.</p>

<p>Prairie Schooner is Obsolete.</p>

<p>The caravan of prairie schooners, requiring six months of hardship and danger
to travel from the Mississippi to the Pacific coast, has been displaced by the
overland express, with palace cars provided with all the conveniences of home,
which travel the distance in thirty-three hours.No less than 80,000 miles of
railroad have been constructed in the transmississippi country during the last
fifty years at the fabulous cost of more than $2,000,000,000.Towns and
villages have sprung into existence along these roads as by magic.Great
cities have been built, commercial relations established with all parts of the
world, and manufacturing has assumed enormous proportions.</p>

<p>Surely with all these achievements during the short space of half a century we
might well celebrate a growth and development unparalleled in history.But
looking to the future rather than to the past, the commercial congress which
authorized this exposition, wisely conceived its objects to the the advancement
of the commercial interests of the west rather than the celebration of any of
its past achievements.</p>

<p>We have gathered here in these beautiful buildings and on these grounds some of
the resources of this vast country, and have invited out eastern neighbors and
foreign friends to bring their products, and come with their citizens to be our
guests and here study with is the lessons of the future which these evidence of
our past progress teach.If the exhibition here made of the resources of this
new country should demonstrate that greater prosperity and happiness could be
found within its borders for many who now live in less favored climes, the
purposes of this exposition would be accomplished.</p>

<p>With a history that has hardly been written, but which records greater growth
and more important changes than has been made in any other country on earth in
500 years of its life; with natural resources unequaled in value, variety and
extent; with a climate which inspires the greatest mental and physical
activity; with a people composed of the best elements of all nations who have
broken the ties which bound them to the homes of their fathers, and have
wrested this country from savage life; with all these advantages and
achievements, what can we prophesy for the future generation, and who will
attempt to limit the possibilities of a people who have accomplished such
wonders in the past?</p>

<p>Will Pale Into Insignificance.</p>

<p>This magnificent exposition, illustrating the products of our soil and mines
and factories, made possible by the interventions of the last century, will
pale into insignificance at the close of the twentieth century.When the
agricultural resources of this rich country are fully developed by the use of
its rivers and streams for irrigation; when the sugar, as well as the bread and
meat for the markets of the world shall be produced here and carried to these
markets by the electric forces of nature; when the minerals in our mountains
and the gold and silver in our mines, shall be extracted and utilized by this
same force; when our natural products shall be manufactured here, then this
transmississippi country will support a population in peace and plenty greater
than the present population of any other nation in the world.</p>

<p>When we consider that the British empire, exclusive of its colonies, embraces
only 121,000 square miles, that the civilization of Egypt was supported on less
than 10,000 square miles, and that with the same density of population as the
state of Ohio this country would provide homes for 300,000,000 people, we can
appreciate the possibilities which the future has in store in this, the richest
part of the world's domain.</p>

<p>Standing at the close of a century teaming with great discoveries and
inventions which have elevated the civilization of the world to a higher plane than ever before, surrounded with such evidences of the past progress and future possibilities of this country, who can prophesy its future greatness, and who can estimate the influence of this exposition in accelerating its development. Like a great beacon light it sends its rays throughout the land and challenges the attention of the world.To the homeless millions of less favored lands it is a messenger of promise.To the weary mariner whose fortunes have been wrecked on the seas of adversity it is a harbinger of hope. It opens new fields to the investor, inspires the ambition of the genius, incites the emulation of states, and stands the crowning glory in the history of the west.</p>

<p>U.S. SENATOR W.V. ALLEN.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the president's address, Hon. G.M. Hitchcock read the following letter from Senator Allen:</p>

<p>"Washington, D.C. May 28, 1898.</p>

<p>Hon. Gurdon W. Wattles, Omaha:</p>

<p>My Dear Sir:</p>

<p>It has become apparent that it will be impractical for me to be at the opening
of the exposition.I regret this extremely, as it has been my desire to be
present, if possible, on that occasion.Having had intimate connection with
the promotion of the enterprise from its inception, I have taken a deep
interest in its success, believing that it will furnish our people a desirable
and peculiar means of education, and that it will be highly valuable in
attracting attention to Nebraska in a way that could not be done otherwise.I
do not doubt the exposition will be successful, and that hundreds of thousands
of people will, by it be attracted to Omaha and the state at large, who would
otherwise know little of the state and city, and that every one who may visit
Nebraska during the exposition will be amply well satisfied.With our great
natural resources, beautiful summer scenery, and the health-giving qualities of
our climate, Nebraska could not be otherwise than attractive to visitors, apart
from what may be seen at the Exposition.Our possibilities as a state are
almost boundless and at present inconceivable.The Nebraska fifty years from
now will present one of the greatest and richest agricultural communities of
the world.</p>

<p>But much as I would like to be with you, and much as I have desired and
intended if possible to be, I feel that I could not excuse myself for leaving
my post of duty at this time when congress is engaged in discussing ways and
means of raising money with which to successfully prosecute the present war
against Spain.We were altogether too long derelict in our duty to Cuba. 
Within less than one hundred miles from our shores the extermination of
1,500,000 people by starvation, of old men, boys, women and children, including
sucklings, went on unchecked until one-third of the population of Cuba have
died by that means.We could no longer justify ourselves in the eyes of the
Christian and civilized by declining to take immediate cognizance of the
conditions there prevailing and live up to our high professions of humanity by
intervening in the war between Spain and her Cuban subjects.We, of all
nations of the western hemisphere have the power to say to Spain that she will
not depopulate Spain by starvation for aspiring to gain the liberty we
ourselves enjoy and hold to be the rightful heritage of all.</p>

<p>From the start I have avocated Cuban liberty, even at a time when it was not
popular in the senate to do so, and having been a pioneer in the cause I could
not feel that my duty was discharged unless I remained at my desk in the senate
until the ways and means of raising the necessary money to prosecute the war
successfully have been fully determined.</p>

<p>I trust that I may be permitted to spend a portion of my summer vacation at the
exposition, and contribute my full share to its success, and if at any time it
shall be deemed desirable by the management for me to deliver an address, I
will gladly do so.I trust that you will do me the honor of announcing during
the exercises the fact that I am detained by my duties at Washington.</p>

<p>Expressing the hope and the full confidence that the exposition will be
preeminently successful, and that ere the summer is gone the war with Spain
will have been successfully terminated, and Cuba, Puerto Rico and the
Philippines made free, and Spain forever driven from her last foot of territory
on this continent, I remain</p>

<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>William V. Allen."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF JOHN L. WEBSTER.</p>

<p>President Wattles announced that in the absence of Senator Allen, he had on
short notice asked Hon. John L. Webster to fill his place.Mr. Webster spoke
as follows:</p>

<p>We meet today amid surroundings that excite the most lively imagination and
rouse the dullest sensibilities.Entrancing and bewitching scenes are all
about us.The best that architecture could plan and that skill could construct
and that art could decorate and adorn, make up the exterior of this, the most
unique exposition ever witnessed on the American continent.</p>

<p>These mighty structures stand where fifty years ago were clustered tepees of
the Omaha Indians.Then the silence of this place was disturbed only by the
Indian war-sound, by the revelry of the Indian dance, and the prairies rang
with no sound but the war-whoop of the aborigine.Today it is surrounded by
twenty-thousand buildings, the homes of 150,000 people, who are the members of
the rich commercial city of Omaha.</p>

<p>But this is not an exposition for our city, or for our state.We are part and
parcel of the great transmississippi country, a country extending from the
river east, which De Soto discovered, westward to the Pacific Ocean, and from
the Mexican republic on the south to the British possessions on the north, a
country with more than 15,000,000 of the Anglo-Saxon people.It is a country
now divided into states and territories, each large enough for an empire, with
resources unparalleled, with soil unexcelled, and with capabilities
immeasurable.It is the granary and market-house of the world.To borrow a
thought from Edmund Burke:"The scarcity which the empires and kingdoms have
many times felt would have been a desolating famine if this child of their old
age, with a true filial pity, with a Roman charity, had not put the breast of
its youthful exuberance to the mouth of its exhausted parents."</p>

<p>On this spot the vast resources and mighty wealth of this extensive
transmississippi territory are today put on exhibition, not so much for our own
instruction and entertainment as that the rest of mankind may come and see for
themselves, look on with a startled amazement and depart with astonishment and
wonder.</p>

<p>But we are not a selfish nor a sectional people.We are a part of a rich,
commercial nation.We know but one constitution, but one country, but one
flag. We have opened the doors of the exposition to all our fellow-citizens
and received the products and exhibits of all the states, which gives it a
truly national character.</p>

<p>World wide in scope</p>

<p>We are cosmopolitan people and extend the scope of the enterprise until it
became international in character.Canada upon the north, and the republics of
South America, are here mingling with us.Exhibitors from various countries in
Europe are here, vying with each other in their efforts to sell.Here may be
seen the Italian, who walks the streets where Caesar's legions once trod; the
Greeks from the classic land where Athens was, and where the Spartans won an
unfading historic fame.Here are a dusky people, with their camels, from the
deserts of Arabia.Here are Turks from that land whose people bow in prayer at
the voice of the priest from the minaret.</p>

<p>Then, too, we welcome the Asiatics from the western shores of the Pacific. 
Here is the Mongolian race from the Chinese Empire, which traces its dynasty
back through the fabulous ages.Here are exhibitors from Japan- that country
which in our day has taken a mighty leap in advance, and is now recognized as
one of the commercial and naval powers of the world.It is this exposition, so
grand in conception, so broad in purpose and so comprehensive in character,
that is this day thrown upon the throng here present, and which extends a
hearty welcome to the millions who shall visit it.</p>

<p>To build these immense palaces of beauty we have drawn from the past as well as
the present.We have studied the artistic among all people and in all
countries.In architecture we have drawn from whatever was the most beautiful
in Gothic, whatever was most refined in classic, whatever was most desirable in
Grecian and whatever was most noble in Roman, and supplemented and improved
them with the most artistic conceptions of the present age, and the result we
see before us is a realistic picture of a fairy scene.</p>

<p>This decorative statuary is not the fruit of a day, the birth of an hour.It
is the present imprint of an art which had its supreme revival in the Moses of
Michael Angelo, and Titian's Tomb by Canova.The figures which these sculptors
chiseled from the marble were the letters of the alphabet of art and have left
an impression on the centuries which have come after them.out of the
fulfillment of that art American skill has decorated these buildings with forms
of grace and of beauty, which express the taste and refinement of this age.</p>

<p>Within the walls of these beautiful buildings, one may wander in a bewildering
maze of exhibits.There will be found the best and richest productions of
American soil; cotton from the vast plantations of Louisiana and Mississippi,
ripened grain from the wheat-fields of Minnesota, Washington and Oregon; and
the golden king corn from Kansas and Nebraska.There may be seen the woods and
finished lumber culled from the pine forests of Michigan, and the high towering
trees of the Columbia river.There may be seen minerals, copper from the
Anaconda, and silver and gold which the energy of our mountain pioneers have
delved from beneath the Rockies and Sierras.There will be seen the skilled
handiwork of the mechanic and artisan, and in machinery hall the perfected
result of what was once an inventor's dream.Within this circle is gathered
evidences of the toil, of the prosperity, and of the refinement of 70,000,000
of industrial people who have brought America to its present high standard of
national supremacy.</p>

<p>Emblem of Republican Majesty.</p>

<p>The government building at the west end of the lagoon, with its long colonnades
and high shining dome, supporting the Goddess of Liberty, stands as the emblem
of power and strength and majesty of this republic.It speaks for the
greatness of our nation, the realization of what John Bright once said: "I see
one vast confederation stretching from the frozen north in unbroken line to the
glowing south, and from the wild billows of the Atlantic westward to the calmer
waters of the Pacific main, and I see one people and one law and one language
and one faith, and over all that wide continent the home of freedom, and a
refuge for the oppressed of every race and of every clime."</p>

<p>We have reached the condition pictured by John Bright, and we have passed
beyond it.Our commerce envelops the seas, and our navy is in the flush of
victory.Our grasp is on the Sandwich Islands and our gallant Dewey holds the
Philippines.</p>

<p>The nation's future which John Bright saw fails short of the future we see
today.We are amazed at our own growth since the days of Washington and
Jefferson to our present invincible power.We are now on the high vantage
ground where we can look forward to the fulfillment of American destiny.The
present is already a realized dream and the brightness of the future is
stronger than a vision.</p>

<p>To know the present let me draw a contrast from the past.Marcus Aurelius
ruled over Rome at the closing of its golden period.His victories in war and
achievements in peace classed him, in the minds of Romans, with Caesar and
Augustus.In a plaza at Rome there was erected a high, towering monument to
his memory.Circling around the column from the base to the capitol the
historic scenes and incidents of his career were carved and chiseled in solid
marble.</p>

<p>That column still stands, browned by the centuries that have rolled by since
its construction.It stands not alone as a relic of antiquity, but as an
historic monument of an age when civilization, linked with all that makes a
nation great and powerful, was in eastern Europe, and when one man ruled the
farthest known portions of the world to the confines of the western sea.At
the side of the square close by is a high and gray colored building, and along
in front in blazoned letters is the name of an American insurance company.</p>

<p>There is a singular linking together by way of contrasts of the changed
conditions of seventeen hundred years.If Marcus Aurelius could come forth
from his long slumber his eye would rest on that monument on which is recorded
the deeds of Rome's greatness and grandeur, and he would see that Imperial City
mouldy with age and its magnificent structures crumbling into ruins.When he
looked on the assembled multitudes he would not see the legions of old that
marched under his command.He would see a new people and hear a new language. 
If he inquired what had wrought this great change, he would find that
civilization in its onward course and westward march, had discovered a new
continent beyond the sea.that a new race of people with a new language had
built up a mighty republic of seventy millions of people, where industry had an
open field, where science had made new discoveries, where literature and art
and refinement were the common property of all her citizens.That this new
people with characteristic energy and enterprise were insuring the lives of the
lazaroni.</p>

<p>Triumph of Fifty Years.</p>

<p>The scene thus presented to Marcus Aurelius would be more astonishing to him
than were the lines upon the wall which were interpreted to Nebuchadnezzar. 
Yet, this transmississippi country has developed more and accomplished more in
the last fifty years than was worked out in the seventeen centuries that marked
the space of time between the age of Marcus Aurelius and the planting of this
western civilization which this exposition is builded to commemorate.</p>

<p>To judge of the future, let us draw another lesson from the past:The earliest
civilization had its habitation in western Asia, in Palestine and Assyria.It
joined hands with trade and commerce as time rolled by and left Babylon and
Ninevah in ruins, and took up its abode in Egypt and northern Africa.Later on
it left the land of the sphynx and pyramids and took up its abode in Greece,
the land that became famous by the sculpture of Praxiteles, by the matchless
oratory of Demosthenes, by the wisdom and philosophy of Socrates and Plato and
by the statesmanship of Pericles and Phocian; the land whose patriotism made
the names Thermopylae and Marathon synonymous with all that is daring and brave
and glorious in war.</p>

<p>Time rolled on and civilization, with its companions, trade and commerce, left
this land of charming scenes and bewitching history and passed westward across
the Adriatic to imperial Rome.From the age of Caesar and Augustus to the time
of Constantine, Rome ruled the old world, but civilization traveled westward
until it reached the confines of Europe, where the ocean seemed a barrier, and
stayed its progress forfourteen long centuries.Rome crumbled into ruins,
Brussels, and Antwerp and Paris and London became the commercial centers. 
Italy broke into dukedoms and provinces and England, France and Germany became
the ruling nations or Europe.Civilization, urged on by its companions, trade
and commerce, like a man of nervous energy and restless ambition, found a way
to cross the ocean and the new continent of America was discovered.They
crossed the stormy waters of the sea and made their new home in this western
hemisphere.Here our nation has grown up and the scepter of supremacy has
passed from the old world to the new.In the fulfillment of our destiny, and
to hold trade and commerce within our grasp, we have to work out the problem of
universal civilization.We may have to join hands with the great powers of
Europe to compass the trade of western Asia, and bring it across the Pacific
into the harbor of Puget Sound, and through the Golden Gate.</p>

<p>Destiny of the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>We are an international nation; Europe is on the east of us, and Asia is on the
west of us.It is no longer a question of the far East, it is a question of
the West.In the southern waters of the Pacific is Australia, practically a
newly discovered country.The Anglo-Saxon people are already there.It is
like a newly risen sun in the southwestern waters, whose foreign commercial
trade of more than $600,000,000 per year demands our most considerate
attention.</p>

<p>There, too, at our western door is Japan, already a great commercial nation,
and with a navy that takes first rank with the modern sphynxes of war which
float in Pacific waters.There, too, is China.Russia has crossed that
territory with a line of railroad whose depot stands fronting the surf-line of
the western ocean, and her flag floats over Port Arthur.England, Germany and
France have their navies floating in their waters and their flags floating in
her fortified harbors.China is about to awake from hibernating sleep of four
thousand years.Her four hundred millions of people are to become the
consumers of American products and the patrons of American commerce.Who can
say that within the next fifty years the commercial trade of the Pacific shall
not take supremacy over the commercial trade of the Atlantic?May not this
exposition mark the beginning of a new era of prosperity, when the commerce of
Europe and of Asia shall find their race course across this mid-continent and
pour out their wealth to overflowing in this transmississippi country.</p>

<p>A month ago it was a serious question whether the war with Spain would not
injure this exposition, but within a month it has become an accentuation of the
expansive power of the American nation.A month ago the American people were
disposed to cling to the traditional policy of isolation; today they receive
with patriotic enthusiasm the doctrine of annexation and of conquest.A month
ago the Philippines were in the far east; today they are in the nearer west.</p>

<p>Emilio Castelar said to the Spanish Cortez twenty-seven years ago, words which
in these days of rapid change breathe the spirit of prophecy; America, and
especially Saxon America, with its immense virgin territories, with its
republic, with its equilibrium between stability and progress, with its
harmonies between liberty and democracy, is the continent of the future, the
immense continent stretched by God between the Atlantic and the Pacific, where
mankind may essay and resolve all social problems.Europe is to decide whether
she will confound herself with Asia, placing upon her lands old altars and upon
the altars old idols, and upon the idols plutocracies and upon the
plutocracies, empires, or whether she will collaborate with America in the
grand work of human civilization.</p>

<p>Spain's Great Mistake</p>

<p>Spain heeded not his voice.She has not taken part with America in the grand
work of civilization.She has clung to her old idols and her despotic empire. 
In this, the close of the nineteenth century, she carried to the beautiful
island of Cuba the cruel and relentless warfare of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Our Saxon civilization of which Castelar spoke entered its protest against the
barbarism of the middle ages being transplanted to this island of the western
hemisphere, and determined to eradicate it by severe arbitrament of war.It is
our high standard of civilization, our love of liberty, our sympathy with
suffering humanity, our regard for national honor, that has brought us to the
initial point where we must solve questions of national policy and which we are
to settle for future ages before the present century shall close.</p>

<p>A month ago the Sandwich Islands seemed too remote an object for the grasp of
national ambition.They have now become a resting place for the American army
in its race across the Pacific to give aid and assistance to our navy in the
Philippines and to make complete the conquest of Admiral Dewey, whose victory
at Manila is the wonder of the age and the marvel of the seas.</p>

<p>Yonder administration building is supported by four open arches, looking toward
the four points of the compass.They are emblematic of the thought that this
exposition stands in the center of the American republic, and that the people
of the transmississippi country, through those gateways, are ready to welcome
to us the commerce and trade from the four corners of the earth, which shall
make use the greatest, the happiest, and the most prosperous people in the
world.</p>

<p>Music, Song of Welcome</p>

<p>The song of Welcome, and ode to the exposition, written by Henry M. Blossom, Jr., of St. Louis, and set to music by Mrs. H.A.A. Beech, of Boston, Mass, was then sung by the exposition chorus of one hundred and fifty voices, under director of music, Professor Willard Kimball, of Lincoln, Nebraska, accompanied by the United States Marine Band. The words of the Exposition Ode were as follows:</p>

<span class="lg song">
<span class="l">Welcome, thrice welcome, to the people of our land;</span>
<span class="l">Welcome to the people, the people of the world;</span>
<span class="l">Here north and south and east and west, united hand in hand</span>
<span class="l">Have reared a city and their flag unfurled.</span>
<span class="l">Welcome, welcome, welcome to the people of the world!</span>
<span class="l"/>
<span class="l">Here science weaves her wonders, her wonders for the mind</span>
<span class="l">Here stands arrayed the golden pride, the golden pride of art,</span>
<span class="l">And commerce hath searched the world to find</span>
<span class="l">The treasures rare of many, of many a far-off mart.</span>
<span class="l">Welcome, welcome, welcome to the people of the world!</span>
<span class="l"/>
<span class="l">Welcome, thrice welcome to the people of our land,</span>
<span class="l">And to the people of the world all hail!</span>
<span class="l">And so forever may this splendor in their memories stand</span>
<span class="l">Undimm'd, although its builded fabric fail.</span>
<span class="l">Welcome, welcome, welcome to the people of our land,</span>
<span class="l">Welcome, and to the people of the world, All hail!</span></span>

<p>Address of Hon. John M. Baldwin.
of Council Bluffs, Iowa.</p>

<p>Mr. John N. Baldwin was then introduced by President Wattles and spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>Man delights in retrospection and indulges in anticipation .The faithful
historian never lacks appreciative audiences, for the dullest eye must lighten
and the most sluggish pulse quicken at the recital of the trials and triumphs
of the past.Neither is a prophesy without honor even in his own country, when
to listeners, whose hopes and aims are one with his, he predicts a glorious
future.</p>

<p>But the critic of existent institutions treads no primrose path.Unless
carefully guarded in expression he will damn with faint praise, disgust with
fulsome flattery, or awaken jealousy by unfavorable comparison.In all ages
there are those who insist that the present time is sick and out of joint; that
there is nothing in the present like unto the past; and that whatever is, is
not comparable with what is to be.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the progress of the world, those who revel in rehearsals and
venture so much in prophecy have not been in the majority; only sufficient in
number to disturb and impede.It is sad to say, but it must be said, that in
our own time there are so many individuals who insist that there is no progress
today except in mechanics.</p>

<p>They croak and cry.It is simply the time of steam, steel and starvation. 
Like puny whispers they pull their pencils to write, "the state in danger". 
They declare and resolve that governments are so drawn and trussed that for the
few there is plethoric plenty while the many starve.They philosophize that
this is an age of machinery, not an heroical, devotional, philosophical or
moral age.</p>

<p>These contentions and opinions imposed upon the thoughtful, intelligent and
progressive men of the time, who believe that the present is better than the
past and promises more for the future, the task of denial of assertion and of
proof.To deny and assert is easy.To prove requires organization and labor. 
In their efforts to arouse men to more glorious triumphs, they met with many
difficulties."Happy men are full of the present, for its bounty suffices
them; and wise men also, for its duties engage them."The busy man would say,
"with me it is what I eat, where shall I drink, my body, what shall it put on?" 
The iconoclastic man, "Do not talk about our achievements.It is better to
listen forever than to brag."Among these and many others the opinion prevails
that there are two classes of lies, common lies and statistics."Give us
proofs", they say, "outward signs and tokens."</p>

<p>In vain did they plead, as did the wise men of old, "Say not thou, 'what is the
cause that the former days were better than these?'For thou dost not require
concerning this."</p>

<p>From out these discussions, controversies and opinions revolved the idea of an
exposition.Tested, it has been found to be practical and promotive.The
exposition is an item of evidence.It goes to prove not only what has been
done, but what may be accomplished.It is an eye-witness and an expert.It
lays in your hand the record of the past.It makes, while you look, the
exhibits of the present.It paints before your eyes the splendor of still
greater achievements on the cloud curtain for the future.It shows itself,
wherever there is a spirit of commercialism, a sense of pride, and an impulse
for improvement.</p>

<p>The exposition has become the instrument of civilization, being a concomitant
to empire, westward it takes its way.The crystal palace, the centennial, the
world's fair, the transmississippi exposition!</p>

<p>We celebrate at this hour the opening of the transmississippi and international
exposition, and this day marks an important era in our development.</p>

<p>Object of the exposition</p>

<p>The purpose of this exposition is to display the products, manufacturers and
industries of the states and territories west of the Mississippi river.The
territory embraced is two-thirds of the area of the Union and contains nineteen
states and five territories.Part of this territory was acquired by purchase
from France in 1805 and part by treaties, negotiations and cessions.</p>

<p>I refer to these facts because from 1802 to 1850 this purchase, these treaties
and these cessions were the subject of public discussions and much that was
said and written fittingly illustrates the thought I have heretofore endeavored
to express.</p>

<p>During these times some there were who deal too much in prophesy, and what they
then foretold is of surpassing interest in view of what has since happened.</p>

<p>Referring to the standard histories and the leading reviews of this period, I
find that the opponents of the acquisition of this territory would rend the
public apart; that no common ties in interest would ever bind together under
one government men who fought Indians, trapped bears and hunted buffaloes, and
men who build ships and caught fish in the harbors of the Atlantic ocean.It
would enormously increase the public debt.Two millions for an island and
possibly as much ground on the main land as is now covered by the state of New
York was enough in all conscience, but to pay fifteen million dollars for lands
containing over one million square miles was revolutionary and
unconstitutional.The limits of the federation could not be safely extended
beyond the stony (Rocky) mountains."As late as 1825 one United States senator
boldly proclaimed in the senate: "A member of congress traveling from his home to Washington and return would cover a distance of 9,200 miles.At the rate of thirty miles per day, and allowing him forty-four days for Sundays, three hundred and fifty days would be consumed, and the member would have fourteen days in Washington before he started home.It would be quicker to go around Cape Horn or by Behring's Strait, Baffin Bay and David Strait to the Atlantic, and so to Washington."</p>

<p>Moans of Early Croakers.</p>

<p>They also said," All settlers who go beyond the Mississippi river will be
forever lost to the United States."Pike, whose name is attached to the giant
peak of the rockies, condemned these plains to everlasting sterility.He
officially reported to the war department as follows:"From these immense
prairies will be derived one great advantage to the United States, namely, the
restriction of our population to some certain limits, and thereby a
continuation of the Union.They will be constrained to limit themselves to the
border of the Missouri and the Mississippi, while they leave the prairies
incapable of cultivation to the wandering and uncivilized aborigines of the
country."</p>

<p>In 1858 the North American Review declared: "The people of the United States
have reached their inland western frontier and the banks of the Missouri are
the shores at the termination of a vast ocean desert for one thousand miles in
breadth which it is proposed to travel, if at all, with caravans of camels and
which interpose a final barrier to the establishment of large communities,
agricultural, commercial or even pastoral."</p>

<p>In all authorized publications and on all school maps, the strip of land lying
west of the Missouri rover and east of the Rocky Mountains south to the Mexican
frontier and north to British America was called "an unknown land " and
designated as "The Great American Desert."</p>

<p>I have the honor today of being the official spokesman of the Transmississippi
and International Exposition.In the discharge of the duty imposed upon me I
now and here assert, realizing full well the breadth and depth and meaning of
every work I utter, that in fertility and productiveness of soil, in mountains
and meadows, rivers and lakes, metals and minerals, forests and farms,
sea-coast and harbors, cereals, fruits and flowers, cattle, horses and hogs,
healthful climate, grandeur of scenery and intelligence and industry of
inhabitants, there is not on this globe a body or tract of land of the same
area equal to that region of country covered by the states and territories of
the Union west of the Mississippi river.</p>

<p>READY TO SHOW THEM.</p>

<p>In proof whereof we welcome you to these grounds. Come through these gates and
enter these buildings.We will give you "ocular proof", or</p>

<p>At the least shall so prove it,
That the probation bears no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on.</p>

<p>With samples and exhibits, records and reports, with representatives
credentialed and accredited, we will prove to the thoughtful, intelligent and
unprejudiced people of the world, that "The Great American Desert" must have
deserted, for it cannot be found.Where fifty years ago they said it was, we
will show a farm of 67,000,000 acres under cultivation, producing annually
products of the value of $1,000,000,000.</p>

<p>The prairies which were considered "incapable of cultivation", produce
annually, 1,200,000,000 bushels of corn, 350,000,000 bushels of wheat and
30,000,000 tons of hay, of the aggregate value of $600,000,000 making no
accounting of the other cereals, the fruits and the vegetables.
Instead of "trapping bear and hunting buffaloes" 9,000,000 horses and mules
work in the valleys; 32,000,000 cattle feed on the hills; 51,000,000 of sheep
and hogs fleece and fatten, and this livestock alone is of the aggregate value
of $1,200,000,000.</p>

<p>They thought $15,000,000 was an extortionate price to pay for this wilderness. 
Today the annual output of gold and silver is $100,000,000; of copper and other
minerals, $100,000,000; and of coal, #30,000,000.With the precious metals
alone from our mines we could pay the purchase price in sixty days.</p>

<p>The "barrier to the establishment of commercial enterprise" stormed by the
sturdy frontiersmen, gave way and on the other side hum and whirl the wheels of
factories, turning out annually $1,400,000,000 worth of the best and cheapest
manufactured goods in the world.</p>

<p>The "caravan of camels" not coming from their Egyptian midnight, the people of
this country constructed 80,000 miles of railway as a means of travel and
transportation.</p>

<p>Homes of Millions.</p>

<p>In the land where only fifty years ago "wandering and uncivilized aborigines"
sought shelter in wigwams and leaf tents now live 22,000,000 of intelligent
people, with 121 universities and colleges, 62,000 school houses, 5,700,000
children, 6,000 newspapers and 45,000 religious organizations, having a
membership of 3,500,000, and worshipping in 44,000 church edifices.</p>

<p>The aggregate wealth of this region of country is $22,000,000,000, or more than one-half the entire capital of Great Britain.</p>

<p>These are not figures of speech, but the arithmetic of facts.I have given the numbers round but always under.</p>

<p>For one of these territories the government paid $7,000,000, yet in a few more
years, it received from the seal islands embraced therein, also, the purchase
price, and there is now in sight in its gold mines enough to pay the national
debt.</p>

<p>Another has the greatest onyx mines in the world, yet its shipments of fruit
amount to 10,000,000 pounds a year.</p>

<p>One of these transmississippi states has the greatest deposits of marble of any
state in the Union, and yet this same state took the prize at the Columbian
Exposition for the best apples in the world.</p>

<p>Another leads the Union not only in gold or silver production, but in the
production of wool as well, and it has more sea-coast than the states of Maine,
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina combined.</p>

<p>Still another produces annually an amount equal to four hundred dollars for
each of its inhabitants, man, woman or child, and no other country in the world
can show an equal product per capita.</p>

<p>Another state has already taken from its mines silver to an amount equal to the
present circulation of silver coin in the United States.One thousand miles
from the place where stand the greatest flour mills in the world, and all in
this same territory, is a land where cotton, corn and olives grow in adjoining
fields.</p>

<p>In one state there is a greater variety of minerals than in any other section
of country of like size in the world.Another has a region of country in the
hills a hundred miles square, which is the richest in the world, containing the
largest and most easily worked mass of low grade ore yet discovered.Another
has an area equal to the German Empire, with 62,000 miles to spare, and could
sustain upon its surface with ease and prosperity the entire population of the
United States.</p>

<p>Wealthy in other ways.</p>

<p>Here we find "literature and the elegant arts growing up side by side with the
grosser plants of daily interest".In almost every city are academics of
painting, sculpture, music and literature.The development in the fine arts
has not been as conspicuous as in the industrial pursuits.I do not think that
I would be superfluously explanatory if I assigned the reason.

These people have imagination and taste, and long to hold communion with the
visible forms of all that is beautiful and refined, but for the last fifty
years they have been using their brain and brawn in a war with rude nature. 
They have been employing their genius to find reason and glory in matter.With
them it has been an age of utility and utensil.Egyptian and Indian
architecture, Phidian sculpture, Gothic minsters, Italian paintings, Grecian
epics and Scottish ballads are not produced by a people whose time is consumed
in constructing railways, building cities, disembowling mountains, draining
lakes into irrigating canals, "bottling up the forces of gravity and selling it
by retail," yoking electricity and steam, and directing them both as unwearied
and obedient servants.</p>

<p>The results which this exposition will show have been attained are largely due
to the character of the people who took possession of this land.They were of
the best blood of the union; men of depth and range; of aplomb and reserve; of
judgment and common sense.Men who would spare nothing and wanted everything. 
Men who believed in action and knew the value of every moment of time.Men who
realized "that the poorest day that passes over us is the conflux of two
eternities.It is made up of currents that issue from the remotest past and
flow onward into the remotest future."Men who soon found that agriculture was
just beginning when they felled the forest, and that driving from the streams
the Indian and his canoe was not the end of commerce.Men who were willing to
give their lifework to the making of the alphabet of the language of
development, leaving the word forming and phrase making to those who would
succeed them.Men who, actuated by the impulse to better themselves and also
their descendants, co-operating with the organic effort of nature "to mount and
ameliorate," overcame the "wilderness" and converted the "desert" into a garden
of benefits.
Man of this People.</p>

<p>I do not believe I shall have adequately discharged the duty of this office
unless I speak of one other factor in the glorious development of this great
country.We today should bow our heads in reverence and speak the name of
Abraham Lincoln.The greatest single factor or agency in the development of
this country and in the bringing of this people together in a spirit of union
and brotherhood was the construction of the Pacific Railways and Abraham
Lincoln was the leading public man who had sufficient prescience of the
necessity of the construction of these railways.</p>

<p>And Abraham Lincoln was of this people.He was born about 100 miles from the
east line of the Louisiana purchase.For fifty-two of the fifty-six years of
his life on earth he labored in his territory with the pioneers for the
development of this country, the organization of its society and the
establishment and preservation of this government.He was a frontiersman, and
yet of all the greatest, the best and the mightiest men of the past nineteen
centuries, he was the only man of whom we can say, "Some there are who doubt
the divinity of Christ, but no one the godliness of Lincoln."</p>

<p>When the cornerstone of this great enterprise was laid, many were the things
which we promised you would see and hear on Opening day.And now into these
magnificent buildings and on these beautiful grounds we ask the people of the
earth to come and judge their fulfillment.While your eyes are enraptured with
the glories of these scenes, your ears will be enchanted with our promised
song.</p>

<span class="lg song">

<span class="l">"Uplift a thousand voices full and sweet</span>
<span class="l">In this wide hall, with earth's inventions stored,</span>
<span class="l">And praise the invisible, universal Lord,</span>
<span class="l">Who lets once more in peace the nations meet</span>
<span class="l">Where science, art and labor have outpoured,</span>
<span class="l">Their myriad horns of plenty at our feet."</span></span>

<p>MUSIC.</p>

<p>Fantasia - The Voice of Our Nation,
was then rendered by the United States Marine Band.</p>

<p>The President of the United States.</p>

<p>The plan to receive the message from President McKinley over the long distance
telephone was changed at the last moment and the message was transmitted by
telegraph by direct wire from Washington to the Exposition grounds, and was
received on the speaker's platform by Mr. W.W. Umstead of the Western Union
Telegraph Co. and read by Governor Silas A. Holcomb, governor of Nebraska, as
follows:</p>

<p>The cordiality of the invitation extended to me to be present at the opening of
your great exposition is deeply appreciated and I more deeply regret that
public duties prevent me from leaving the capital at this time.</p>

<p>The events of the memorable half century which the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition commemorates are interwoven with the history of the
whole nation, and are of surpassing importance.The mighty west affords most
striking evidences of the splendid achievements and possibilities of our
people.It is a matchless tribute to the energy and endurance of the pioneer,
while its vast agricultural development, its progress in manufactures it
advancement in the arts and sciences and in all departments of education and
endeavor have been inestimable contributions to the civilization and wealth of
the world.</p>

<p>Nowhere have the unconquerable determination, self-reliant strength and sturdy
manhood of our American citizenship been more forcibly illustrated.In peace
or war the men and women of the west have ever been in the vanguard.I
congratulate the management upon its magnificent enterprise and assure all who
participate in this undertaking of the deep interest which the government has
in its success.</p>

<p>William McKinley.</p>

<p>Governor Holcomb then addressed the multitude as follows:</p>

<p>This occasion, the day and the hour, will ever remain memorable in the history
of the transmississippi country.It marks a most interesting event in the
history of this commonwealth and measures a step forward in the progress of our
great republic.To the people of Nebraska, the ceremonies attending the
opening of the Transmississippi and International Exposition are freighted with
special personal interests of the most impressive character.</p>

<p>This day has been anxiously awaited by every patriotic citizen of the state. 
The inception and successful inauguration of an enterprise, so grand in its
scope and fraught, as we believe it is, with so much good to the present and
future generations, is gratifying alike to all.An exposition denoting the
ever advancing civilization of the present age, and by a people inhabiting over
one-half of the area of the United States and comprising over one-third of its
population, held within the boundaries of our great commonwealth, is an honor
and distinction gratifying to our state pride, and for which all Nebraskans are
duly appreciative.For five months it will be the great pleasure, as well as a
high privilege, for our people to extend with welcome hands and warm hearts a
hospitable greeting to the people of all portions of our common country, and to
those from other lands who may participate in or visit this magnificent
display.We cordially invite all to visit us and view the evidences of the
marvelous progress made by the people of the great west in the material
advancement in the industries, arts and sciences; to learn of the wonderful and
inexhaustible resources of a country which in extent forms an empire and whose
unparalleled resources when utilized can be made to bless and make happy
millions of mankind who may in this vast domain find innumerable opportunities
for the establishment of prosperous homes.</p>

<p>Here, gathered by the energy, industry and ingenuity of man, will be found the
products of land and sea, of farm and field, of factory and mine, all giving
evidence of the wonderful richness of a country yet only partially developed,
and displaying the marvelous progress made by its citizens in keeping step with
the grand march of civilization throughout the world.The spirit of progress
and philanthropy in the upbuilding of an industrial empire in our midst,
displayed upon every hand, must challenge the admiration and solicit unstinted praise from all who shall visit us and behold what has been accomplished by these people in scarce one-half century of labor.These are the evidences of the intelligent and well directed efforts of a people who, with a courage that is undaunted and a faith that is undismayed, have wrested from nature's primeval conditions this beautiful land, and established a civilization that will forever bless mankind.</p>

<p>This great exposition celebrates and commemorates no important epoch in the history of the country.It is an epoch in itself.It has grown and assumed
shape and form as an expression of the desires of a people to celebrate the
development of the resources of a country, the result of their own struggles, labors and final triumphs.It is grander and far more reaching in its scope than the celebration of some anniversary in our country's history. It emphasizes and makes comprehensive the accomplishments of an intelligent, progressive people toward a higher civilization.It is a composite picture of
the growth of a people made during the early years of settlement in a new and untried country.It is befitting that as the nineteenth century is drawing to a close, with its fruitage of the manifold blessings which have been showered upon the people of the earth during its reign, that we of the western and newer half, of the American republic, should take an inventory of the stock of great riches of which we are possessed in order that we may thereby be the better enabled to assume the duties and responsibilities and to solve the problems of the advancement of the human race that come crowding upon us with the dawning of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>With the force of a proverb it has been said of man "Know Thyself"; and with
greater emphasis may it be declared, "Know they country."Study its structure
as formed by divine hands.Know its rivers and mountains, its forests and
prairies, its valleys and plains, its climate and soil.Learn of its hidden
treasures of gold and silver, of coal and iron; its productive fields of grain
and grasses, of vegetables and fruits, its plains of rich grazing for horses,
cattle and sheep.Inform yourself of the cities and towns, of telegraphs and
telephones, of railroads and steamboats, of the ever pulsing arteries of
commerce, the facilities for exchange of the products of man's ingenuity and
industry, and a faint conception will be gained of the present greatness and
future possibilities of this magnificent transmississippi country.</p>

<p>As this beautiful exposition city, with its thousands of exhibits representing
every branch of industry, pleasing to the eye and inspiring to the mind, has
sprung into existence in so short a period as if by magic, so has the
transmississippi country developed during the last half century with marvelous
rapidity.This has been accomplished by the courage and untiring energy of
those who have peopled its broad domains.The evidences here witnessed of the
advancement of the people and the development of the country's resources
inspire within us a spirit of thankfulness that God has given us so goodly a
land, to be made beautiful and to fructify for the enjoyment and benefit of
mankind.</p>

<p>Though young in years, we of the west ask no allowance on the score of age, but
challenge investigation and comparison with improvements made by countries of
maturer years, confident that no unfavorable impression of us will result
therefrom.In this hour of festivity and rejoicing we are not unmindful that
it is also a time of trial for the nation.Loyal citizens from every section
of the country have sprung to arms in defense of national honor, in the cause
of humanity.Sectional lines have been obliterated in the face of threatened
danger from foreign foes.A reunited people are fighting side by side under
the stars and stripes, the banner of liberty and progress.</p>

<p>Amidst these marvelous collections of our triumphs in the peaceful pursuits of
life we hope it may again be demonstrated that "peace hath her victories no
less renowned than war" and that our countrymen of the east may meet us here in
this midway city of the continent, learn of our progress in the past, our
aspirations and high aims, our hopes for the future and the integrity of our
purpose and determination to contribute to a better civilization in developing
this great country and to attain the high destiny designed for us by the Maker
of the Universe.</p>

<p>President Wattles then announced that the machinery of the Exposition would be
set in motion by President McKinley, and the exercise closed by the singing of
the National Hymn, "America", by the Exposition Chorus and the audience,
accompanied by the U.S. Marine Band.</p>

<p>The entire audience joined in the singing, and amid the blowing of whistles,
ringing of bells, and the song of the enthusiastic thousands, the
Transmississippi and International Exposition was formally declared open to the
world.</p>

<p>Scene in Washington</p>

<p>The following excerpt from one of the wires from Washington, pictures the scene
at the White House at the hour of official opening.</p>

<p>"Conditions were well nigh perfect when, at 1:30 o'clock today, Washington
time, corresponding to 12:30 Omaha, time, President McKinley pushed the button,
formally opening the Transmississippi and International Exposition.Around the
chief executive were grouped many of the foremost men in public life, men who
have been moulding public opinion for a quarter of a century.It was an
inspiring scene, this culmination of many anxious moments, of personal
sacrifice on the part of those who have given time and money to so gigantic an
undertaking that out of it all might come a better appreciation of the forces
dominating that vast territory which extends from the Mississippi river to the
Pacific Ocean, from the frigid north to the Gulf of Mexico.In his short term
in the presidential chair Major McKinley has shown patriotic devotion to the
whole country and wherever possible in his active, busy life has lent his
presence and his help to enterprises of both local and national character.</p>

<p>It has been the intention of officials connected with the Transmississippi
Exposition, to have the president deliver his address through the long distance
telephone, but being fearful that some slip might occur, the president decided
to rely on the telegraph and especially as he was not accustomed to use the
telephone since his term as president began.In order to conform to the
arrangements, the hour of formally recognizing the Transmississippi and
International Exposition as open, was deferred until 1:30 o'clock, at which
time there was assembled in the president's reception room the following
distinguished party:Senators Allen and Thurston, Representatives Mercer,
Stark, Sutherland, Maxwell and Greene, Mrs. Sutherland and daughter, Mrs.
Greene and daughters, Mr. Bert Wheeler, Representative Fleming of Georgia,
Representative Johns of North Dakota, and Senator W.B. Allison of Iowa.</p>

<p>Considerable delay was experienced by Captain Montgomery in getting a wire out
of Chicago and direct to the Exposition grounds, but finally the welcome sound
"Omaha" came to the alert telegrapher and there were flashed these words by
Montgomery:</p>

<p>This is the White House, Washington.When this key closes, the President will
close it.</p>

<p>"Everything is ready, Mr. President," said Captain Montgomery, and the chief
executive, gracious in manner, stepped to the key of the instrument, and
depressing it with his right hand, closed the circuit.Those in the room stood
during this ceremony, of little interest to laymen, but of greater interest to
those gathered in the cool reception room - and at 1:53 o'clock, Washington
time, the president announced that his part of the ceremony was over, and the
exposition was formally opened.</p>

<p>There was clapping of hands and congratulations and thanks showered upon the
executive for his patience and affability and taking so much time from the
affairs of the nation to give the Transmississippi Exposition the benefit of
his benediction and good wishes.Immediately after the pressure upon the
button, the president's message of congratulation was sent, which was followed
by congratulatory telegrams of the Nebraska delegation, terminating a most
auspicious occasion for Omaha and the west.</p>

<p>Immediately after the congratulatory wire of the president had been sent, and
indication given from Omaha that so far as the president was concerned, his
work had been done, executive clerk Montgomery sent the following wire to
President Wattles:</p>

<p>The members of the Nebraska delegation assembled in the executive mansion, beg
leave to extend their congratulations upon this auspicious beginning of so vast
an enterprise as the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and regret
their inability to be present, and to personally participate in its
accomplishment.</p>

<p>William V. Allen Samuel Maxwell</p>
<p>J.M. ThurstonW.A. Stark</p>
<p>D.H. Mercer R.D. Sutherland</p>
<p>W.L. Greene</p>

<p>Following the exercises of formal opening, the official guests were entertained at luncheon in the Markel Cafe.</p>

<p>At four o'clock an official public reception was held in the United States
Government building at the west end of the main porch.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock P.M. a concert was given in the auditorium by the Theodore
Thomas Orchestra, assisted by the Exposition chorus.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock P.M. a grand illumination of fire works was given in the north
tract, east of the agricultural implement building, and thus the first day of
the Exposition passed into history.</p>

<p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition was the first of American
expositions to open its gates on the day originally set for opening and the
first to have its main buildings completed and its exhibits practically
installed on opening day.But it early became evident that something besides
the attractions of the beautiful grounds and buildings and exhibits, was
necessary to insure a large attendance.Splendid instrumental music by the
United States Marine band and other bands of national repute had been secured. 
The Theodore Thomas Orchestra had been engaged for daily concerts during the
month of June, but besides these some special attractions were early planned by
the president to arouse and hold constant attendance and interest.Special
days were set aside for states, cities and societies, and every possible
occasion was used as an excuse for special rates from the railroads.</p>

<p>NEBRASKA DEDICATION DAY</p>

<p>June 14, 1898.</p>

<p>This was the day selected by the Nebraska State Commission for the formal
dedication of the Nebraska building.</p>

<p>This building occupied a most commanding position.Standing near the edge of
the bluff, overlooking the broad valley of the Missouri, its imposing
appearance made it an object of attention.The building was 90 x 142 feet on
the ground, and about 90 ft. high to the top of the dome.It cost about
$25,000 and was furnished at cost of about $5000.It was admirably adapted to
the purpose for which it was intended; official headquarters for the Nebraska Commission, and a home for visiting Nebraskans.</p>

<p>The day was fine and great interest was manifested in the proceedings. Special trains on all the Nebraska railroads brought in thousands from interior and remote parts of the state.</p>

<p>As the hour of 11 o'clock A.M. approached, a procession of carriages arrived,
halted at the west entrance to the building, and the distinguished guests of
the day alighted.The party compromised the Governor, the Honorable Silas A.
Holcomb, accompanied by his entire staff in full regimentals; the President of
the Exposition and the Honorable William J. Bryan.The party was under the
escort of Chairman Neville, and Secretary Caspar of the Nebraska Commission. 
The speakers of the occasion occupied a raised dais at the nroth end of the
large assembly room, which was beautifully and profusely decorated for the
occasion.</p>

<p>At 11:45 A.M. Commissioner Boydson, acting as master of ceremonies, led the way
to the speaker's platform, followed by Governor Holcomb and staff, President
Wattles, United States Senator W.V. Allen, Chancellor McLean of the University
of Nebraska, ex-Governors Alvin Saunders, Lorenzo Crounse and James E. Boyd;
Honorable William F. Gurley; Members of the Nebraska Exposition Commission, and
Attorney-General C.J. Smyth.</p>

<p>Chancellor McLean delivered the invocation.he was in good voice and his
prayer that the Divine blessing might rest on the building, the commissioners,
the state and its inhabitants, was a literary gem.</p>

<p>The York Glee Club under the direction of Dr. B.F. Lang then sang - The Union
of States we Hail.</p>

<p>The formal dedication of the building was in charge of Judge William Neville. 
He spoke briefly without notes.Refering to the Nebraska Building, the
chairman said it offered headquarters for the secret societies, and all other
societies, for the people of all politics and creeds, and hoped that they all
would make the building their home while at the Exposition and in closing he
introduced the governor.</p>

<p>Governor Holcomb.</p>

<p>The governor spoke briefly of the progress of the Great West, particularly of
the state of Nebraska, referring to the period when the section of which
Nebraska is the center, was regarded as a barren spot, and sketched some of the
hardships experienced by some of the early settlers of the state, the primitive
habitations used, and directed attention to the typical sod house exhibited
east of the Nebraska building, illustrative of the fertility of resource of the
early settlers.</p>

<p>Nebraska Poem.</p>

<p>A poem entitled Nebraska was then recited by Mrs. McKeerer of Stromsberg,
Nebraska.</p>

<p>President Wattles.</p>

<p>President Wattles was then introduced to accept the building in behalf of the
Exposition.He said:</p>

<p>In behalf of the management of the Transmississippi and International
Exposition I accept this beautiful building dedicated here today for the
comfort and convenience of the citizens of Nebraska.I commend the wisdom of
its conception, the care and economy in its erection and the beauty and
convenience of its design.The management of the Exposition appreciates the
broad and liberal hospitality of the state board of directors in providing a
home on these grounds, not only for our own citizens, societies and
institutions, but for the representatives of other states and territories.The
comforts of this building will afford to thousands of strangers who will accept
its hospitality, and will do much to accomplish one of the great objects of
this exposition which is to cement the ties of friendship and good feeling and
bind together with pleasant memories and common interests the citizens from all
parts of this great country.The east has misunderstood the west and has not
appreciated its resources, its citizens and its magnificent opportunities.To
the state of Nebraska, the future historian will give the credit of erecting in
times of adversity a great exposition destined to break down prejudices, build
up commerce and promote peace and good will throughout the land.</p>

<p>When our excellent governor recommended in his last biennial message to this
legislature of this state a liberal appropriation in aid of this exposition, a
discussion on the merits of this enterprise was precipitated throughout the
state, which, for several months grew in intensity until a bill was finally
passed and became a law providing for a state building and a state exhibit. 
Many of the speeches in opposition to this measure would be amusing if
reproduced here today.But when we consider the conditions which prevailed
three years ago in this state we cannot wonder that many questioned the
advisability of the enterprise.A great panic had paralyzed our business
interests; two crop failures had discouraged our farming communities; many of
our citizens in the western parts of the state had but recently received public
charity and many had abandoned their lands to seek homes in southern climes or
to go back to eastern friends and relatives.Conditions never seemed more
discouraging and to many who live only in the present an exposition of our
resources in 1898 meant failure and disgrace.</p>

<p>But adverse conditions make heroes.The richest inheritance of this generation
is the courage and energy of the pioneers of the west.These pioneers subdued
the savage tribes which occupied this territory, drove back the buffalo and
antelope and made productive farms of the desert they occupied.They built
railroads, school-houses, churches and colleges; they bravely met and
surmounted every emergency; they were the best blood and brain of the east and
of all parts of the world.From them and their descendants came words of
encouragement and support to the managers of this enterprise.Those men who
had seen the state of Nebraska in times of temporary adversity before, knew
that the natural conditions of this state justified the expectation of a speedy
return of good crops and prosperity in business, and so from all parts of the
state came a demand by petition and through the press in favor of the
exposition which our legislators could not resist.</p>

<p>That the appropriation of state and national funds for this exposition was
wise, cannot be doubted by any who believe in public schools and other public
institutions of learning.From an educational standpoint; what could impart
more information and better education than an exposition of this character?
Who can stand at either end of the grand court and look at the magnificent
spectacle of architectural grandeur there displayed without receiving
impressions and inspiration which will last through life.To the farmer whose
days are spent in honest toil in the quiet and peaceful pursuits of country
life, what must be the sensations of wonder and delight in seeing for the first
time the electrical effects of these grounds and buildings at night.To the
great majority of our citizens who have never seen the capital of the nation
and the departments of our government, what could be more interesting and
educating than the illustrations of the workings of these departments made in
the beautiful government building here?To one and all the display of art from
the masters of the Old World and the best painters of modern times, the
statuary, the machinery, the products of farm and factory, and the highest and
best results of genius and invention cannot fail to be a school of learning
that could not be equaled in any other way.</p>

<p>But the financial benefits of this exposition to the state of Nebraska and to
the entire west will amply repay the expense and effort in its promotion. 
Already the attention of the world has been attracted by the magnificent
display of our resources here made, and during the next four months, thousands
of homeseekers and investors will visit the exposition and investigate the
opportunities of the west.That this state will secure its full share of this
tide of immigration we cannot doubt when we consider that the growing crops
this year in many counties promise to exceed the value of the farms on which
they are produced, that the livestock interests of the state have doubled in
the last four years and that thousands of acres of the richest and best lands
in the world for the production of corn and sugar beets are today unoccupied. 
New life and energy will be infused in all branches of industry throughout the
state by the men and money that will be attracted here by the exposition and
the improved conditions which now prevail.The investment of this state will
be returned many fold by the increase in value of its taxable property and by
the higher and better civilizations of its citizens.</p>

<p>In view of the many benefits of this Exposition to the state of Nebraska, I
most heartily congratulate his excellency, the governor, the lawmakers of this
state and the state board of directors fo the exposition on the wisdom and
statesmanship displayed in making an appropriation for a state building and an
exhibit here.I congratulate them on this magnificent building which does
honor to the state it represents and credit to the exposition of which it forms a partm. In the name of the Exposition, I accept this building for the
purposes for which it is this day dedicated.</p>

<p>Honorable W. J. Bryan.</p>

<p>After music by the Glee Club Mr. Bryan reviewed the progress of the state and
touched upon the Cuban War in the following language:</p>

<p>Nebraska is ready to do her part in time of war as well as in time of peace. 
Her citizens were among the first to give expression to their sympathy with the
Cuban patriots, and her representatives in the senate and house took a
prominent part in the advocacy of armed intervention by the United States.</p>

<p>When the president issued a call for volunteers, Nebraska's quota was promptly
furnished, and she is prepared to respond to the second and subsequent calls.</p>

<p>Nebraska's attitude upon this subject does not, however, indicate that the
state is inhabited by a contentious or warlike people; it simply proves that
our people understand both the rights conferred, and the obligations imposed,
by a proximity to Cuba.Understanding these rights and obligations, they do
not shrink form any consequences which may follow the performance of a national
duty.
War is harsh; it is attended by hardship and suffering; it means a vast
expenditure of men and money.We may well pray for the coming of the time,
promised in Holy Writ when the spears shall be beaten into pruning-hooks, and
the swords into plough-shares; but the universal peace cannot come until
justice is enthroned throughout the world.Jehovah deals with nations as He
deals with men, and for both decrees that the wages of sin is death.Until the
right has triumphed in every land and love reigns in every heart, governments
must, as a last resource appeal to force.As long as the oppressor is deaf to
the advice of reason, so long must the citizen accustom his shoulder to the
musket and his hand to the saber.</p>

<p>Our nation exhausted diplomacy in its efforts to secure a peaceable solution of
the Cuban question; and only took up arms when it was compelled to choose
between war and servile acquiescence and cruelties which would have been a
disgrace to barbarism.</p>

<p>History will vindicate the position taken by the United States in the war with
Spain.In saying this, I assume that the principles which were invoked in the
inauguration of the war will be observed in its prosecution and conclusion.If
a contest undertaken for the sake of humanity degenerates into a war of
conquest, we shall find it difficult to meet the charge of having added
hypocrisy to greed.</p>

<p>Is our national character so weak that we cannot withstand the temptation to
appropriate the first piece of land that comes within our reach?To inflict
upon the enemy all possible harm is legitimate warfare, but shall we
contemplate a scheme for the colonization of the Orient merely because our
fleet won a remarkable victory in the harbor of Manila?</p>

<p>Our guns destroyed a Spanish fleet, but can they destroy that self-evident
truth, that governments derive their just powers - not form superior force, but
from the consent of governed?</p>

<p>Shall we abandon a just resistance to European encroachment upon the western
hemisphere in order to mingle in the controversies of Europe and Asia?</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>The next item in the program was a vocal solo by Professor Morte Parsons of Omaha, - words and music composed by him, and entitled</p>

<p>The Little Old Sod Shanty on the Plains.</p>

<p>Honorable W.F. Hurley was the next speaker, and his remarks were as follows:</p>

<p>Fellow Citizens:The dedication of the Nebraska building is in reality the
inauguration of the transmississippi exposition.The orators of this occasion,
speaking with authority, voice the welcome of a most gracious host, the
commonwealth of Nebraska.The ceremonials of this hour convey formal notice to
the civilized world that the hospitality of our state is boundless and that
every guest within out gates shall find a royal welcome.</p>

<p>The American exposition of the broadest scope has heretofore been not only
commemorative, but has been the chronicle of some great national anniversary,
or the celebration of an epoch in history.The transmississippi exposition has
no place in this majestic series of formal festivals.No memory which duty
enjoins to embalm in marble sits enthroned among the palaces of this triumphal
city.It rears today its domes of gold and minarets of alabaster as an
inspiration born of the passionate impulse of a proud people; not a memory, but
a radiant dream - a dream which is also a prophecy!</p>
<p>
For more than a hundred years the traditions of the republic have found
lodgment among the granite hills of New England and in the pine groves and
cotton fields of the balmy south.To New England and the south we turn with
pride to read the annals of American ancestry; but in the magnificent prairie
and mountain states, those colossal principalities which comprise the "seat of
empire" of the new west, enthroned between the mountains and the Mississippi,
we behold the fulfillment of the hope of American posterity.</p>

<p>The Centennial and the World's Fair were superb monuments to the glittering
pageantry of completed history.The exposition, to which we bid you welcome,
is unique in character, and in its promise of future grandeur more wonderful
than the crystallization of centuries of matured development which
characterized the national pageants at Philadelphia and Chicago.The perfected
products of a matured civilization may well incite the admiration of observant
men.But it has remained for the progressive population of this royal region,
rich in resources beyond the flight of the most exuberant fancy, to present for
the delectation of mankind the inexhaustible treasures of an incomparable
territory, comprising the most princely provinces of our national domain.</p>

<p>This exposition is representative not of what we have been, but rather of what
we may be, and under the providence of God what we are to be, Nebraska rejoices
that the time has come when as the official representative of the great west
she may extend a welcome to the denizen of the East; hopeful and confident that
by contact and association those errors and misconceptions which have arisen as
to the character and purpose of her citizenship may be forever swept away.</p>

<p>Conservative and radical are much abused terms.In recent years they have been
employed to emphasize a demarkation line between the so-called eastern and
western halves of the republic.The accumulated wealth of the east, by virtue
of the logic of human nature, has impressed its timidity and conservative
quality upon the citizenship of that portion of the republic.In the east
dwell the sentinels of wealth.In the west, pioneers of fortune.He who has
is ever conservative, while he who hopes is ever radical.I do not hesitate to
affirm that the radicalism of the west, born of honest tumult and patriotic
commotion, is the sure sign of that superb progression which blazes the pathway
of civilization, and builds the roadways for the onward march of humanity
toward the final and triumphant destiny of the race.</p>

<p>To be radical is to agitate, and in agitation lies the safety of the republic. 
Some one has defined agitation to be "marshaling the conscience of a nation to
mould its laws," and since John Brown trod the soil of Kansas, we of the west,
have been agitators.Popular government can only exist through a continual
process of fermentation.Free speech is at the basis of free institutions, and
out of the clamor and heat of partisan discussion arises the best thought, the
highest purpose of a patriotic people.</p>

<p>My fellow-citizens:I can conceive of no more appropriate occasion than the
present, on this day, and at this hour, to protest against the misconception of
our status as a commonwealth, or our purpose as a people.WIth seventeen years
of personal knowledge and an intimate acquaintance with the history of Nebraska
since its admission to the sisterhood of states; as a loyal son of this
glorious commonwealth, I challenge the assertion, whenever or wherever made,
that any branch of our state government in any period of its history, has ever
made an assault upon the rights of citizenship, real or personal, or endeavored
to wield an arbitrary authority in defiance of law or constitution.</p>

<p>Agitation is one thing - lawlessness another.The west is turbulent, but not lawless; and out of that turbulency and commotion, there arises the spirit of the genius of liberty.</p>

<p>Today Nebraska throws open wide her golden gates, and summons to her portals the myriads of mankind.To this enchanted city of the plains she lures with wizard wand the unnumbered host of other lands and climes.Superb sponsor of a regal hospitality, broad as the prairies, rich and varied as the mountain range which rear their snow-crowned crests in salutation to the sky; robed in the glittering garments which nature weaves alone in token of man's toil; imperial in her pride, her sovereign brow tinged with the glow of the approaching dawn, she bids the nations hail.</p>

<p>HONORABLE C.J. SMYTH.</p>

<p>After a further musical selection by the Glee Club, Attorney General C.J. Smyth
was introduced, and his address was as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. President, ladies and gentlement:This is Nebraska's day.It is on this
day that we may sound the praises of our great commonwealth.She bids her sond
to do this, not in the spirit of vanity, but that she may be known as she is. 
Not one jot nor tittle would she take from the glory of her sister states who
have come here to display in these buildings and on these grounds the evidences
of their growth, their wealth and their enterprise.With delight will she
listen when they tell of their resources and their triumphs.To them she
extends that welcome which becomes a generous, broad-minded and truly American
commonwealth; and to none will she yield in admiration of their greatness.</p>

<p>If we would understand Nebraska as she is, the work of her sons in bringing her
to her present condition and the probabilities of her future, we mut look back
and contemplate, if only for a moment, the "small beginnings" from which she
sprang.</p>

<p>In 1834 the congress of the United States denominated the territory of which
she was then a part, as "The Indian Country".It was, in fact, at that time
the country of the savage.The white man had no dominion therein, and the
sweet word "home" was without a meaning on all its broad prairies.Less than
fifty years ago the Omaha Indians held title to the land on which we stand, and
the entire white population at that time in this vast territory did not exceed
five thousand souls.</p>

<p>Not many years after the Omahas ceded their title to this territory to the
United States, Nebraska's pioneers came and commenced the work of home building
and state building.The days of the freighters followed; the Union Pacific was
projected and finished; the ox-team gave way to the freight train; the prairie
schooner to the upholstered car, and thus the evolution went on until within
the short span of forty-five years it has culminated in the palaces of art that
lift their classic outlines within the walls of this exposition.Marvelous has
been the progress.</p>

<p>The surplus products of her farms last year- that is, the products she was able
to send to market,- were worth over $55,000,000.She has over three thousand
factories, with a capital invested of $40,000,000.These factories pay yearly
more than $12,000,000 in wages, and the value of their output is $95,000,000
annually.Here on the border of her chief city are located packing-houses
which bring Nebraska near to the second packing center of the world.Fourteen
lines of railway have a mileage of four thousand seven hundred and thirty
miles, carrying Nebraska's commerce.</p>

<p>This is but a glimpse of Nebraska, as she is materially; how is she in those
departments of activity which develop the higher nature of man which refines
his thoughts and makes him a force in the dominion of taste and intellect? Six
universities, twenty-nine colleges, seventeen academies, 6,690 common schools
and seventy-five private schools educate 360,000 of her sons and daughters. 
This is Nebraska's day, and this exposition is her palace.As she steps to the
main entrance thereof to welcome her guests of the transmississippi region,
notice the inscription on her shield.It illustrates the fact that she has the
lowest rate of illiteracy of all the states of all this Union.The national
government has placed her percentage at 3.11.</p>

<p>How appropriate, then, that the representatives of this transmississippi region
should select this state as the place wherein to exhibit to the world their
best specimens of the triumph of the mind over matter, and what specimens they
are!If you would see a picture as beautiful as ever man created, contemplate
the grand court when illuminated at night.Go into the buildings, look at the
evidence there of what man has done, and then say, if you will, that his
achievements in the transmississippi country have not been surpassingly great. 
But do not be surprised, for in this region we possess the best blood and
brains of our country.From the east, and from every nation under the sun,
have come to us energy, independence of character and irresistible
progressiveness that knows no halt until it reaches its goal or the grave. 
From what race has sprung those men?The Anglo-Saxon?Those who weep because
we have not lords, and castles and crests and other evidences of barbarism,
answer "Yes".Men who deal in facts, and not in fancies answer, "No".Read
the names of those who perished with the Maine, who supported the immortal
Dewey, or who went into the jaws of death with the heroic Hobson.Were they
all Anglo-Saxon?Who will say so?Truth declares that many races were
represented there, The Dane and the Swedish; the German and the Irish. 
Shoulder to shoulder they stood behind the guns of their adopted country,
offered their lives on her altar, and thanked God that they were Americans, the
best race that ever blessed the earth, the combination of all that is good in
all the races of the world.</p>

<p>Today Nebraska sends greetings to the oppressed of every race and of every
clime.To all, no matter of what race they come, who have energy, intelligence
and industry, couples with a love of freedom, she opens wide her gates and bids
them welcome.Here under the blessings of our free institutions, and breathing
the air of the most healthful climate in the world they will have their energy
stimulated, their industry rewarded, and their liberty protected.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>Thus the exercises were concluded and the Commissioners and guests proceeded to
the Markel Cafe, where luncheon was served.</p>

<p>The program of exercises for Nebraska Dedication Day has been given in full
practically as reported by one of the Omaha papers.Other celebrations in the
dedication of buildings which were held during the months of June and July were
similar and only the programs in a few of the most interesting will be given in
full.</p>

<p>WISCONSIN DEDICATION DAY.</p>

<p>June 18, 1898.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin building was a handsome structure facing the Illinois building on
one of the best locations on that part of the grounds set aside for State
Buildings.It was classic in style and excellently planned to meet the
purposes for which it was erected.A.C. Clas of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a member
of the Wisconsin Commission, was the architect of the building, and it was
erected at a cost of about $10,000.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin Exposition Commissioners present, were John C. Koch of Milwaukee,
president; E.C. Clas of Milwaukee, treasurer; J.E. Hansen of Milwaukee, C.H.

<p>ILLINOIS DEDICATION DAY.</p>

<p>June 20, 1898.</p>

<p>Illinois, next to Nebraska, appropriated the largest sum for participation in
the Exposition.The appropriation of the state of Illinois was $45,000.Of
this sum $20,000 was set aside for a state building.The Illinois building
attracted much attention, and was one of the favorites of the group of state
buildings.Its location was at the extreme north end of the tract set aside
for state buildings near the Music Pavilion, and overlooking the broad Missouri
Valley.An annex to the building was erected and maintained as an art gallery
for the Columbian Exposition pictures painted by John R. Key.</p>

<p>The celebration of the dedication of the Illinois building was participated in
by many Illinoisans who came in regular and special trains.Among others,
about 100 members of the famous Apollo Club were present and their concerts in
the main court were of great interest to all exposition visitors.Delegates
were present representing the following organizations:The Union League Club;
Stock Exchange; Board of Trade; National Business league, and Chicago World's
Fair Directors of Chicago.</p>

<p>The exercises were held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock A.M., and were of such
unusual interest as to be given extended mention.</p>

<p>Gathered on the speaker's stand were Governor John M. Tanner and wife of
Illinois; Governor Silas A. Holcomb of Nebraska; Honorable Clarke E. Carr,
president of the Illinois Commission; Honorable W.H. Harper, chairman of the
Executive Committee, and the other members of the Illinois Commission, several
members of the Nebraska Commission, members of the Executive Committee of the
Exposition, members of the Bureau of Entertainment, and many prominent men of
the West.The Apollo Club occupied seats on the back of the stage and the U.S.
Marine Band immediately in front.The program was as follows:</p>

<p>Music: The Stars and Stripes Forever,</p>
<p>U.S. Marine Band</p>
<p>Prayer:Chancellor MacLean, of the University of Nebraska.</p>
<p>Address:Hon. W.H. Harper, Chairman of the Executive Committee.</p>

<p>Chairman Harper, in well chosen words, complimented the Exposition on its
auspicious inauguration, and spoke at length regarding the work done by the
Illinois Commission.</p>

<p>Address: Colonel Clarke E. Carr, President</p>
<p>of the Illinois Commission.</p>
<p>Address: Gov. John M. Tanner, of Illinois.</p>
<p>Music: By the Apollo Club.</p>
<p>Address: President G.W. Wattles, of the Exposition.</p>
<p>Remarks: Governor Silas A. Holcomb.</p>
<p>Address: Ex-Governor Joseph L. Beveridge.</p>

<p>Colonel Carr's Address was as follows:</p>

<p>When LaSalle was, with his heroic followers, exploring western wilds, soon
after leaving Lake Michigan he came to the headwaters of a river upon which he
launched his canoes and floated down with the current.The river broadened and
deepened as he advanced, and he soon became convinced that it belonged to the
great system which drained all the vast region of the northwest.He made
excursions upon either side and found himself in the midst of vast meadows of
waving grass which seemed illimitable.One day the party came upon an Indian
village and found it to be the home of a people who called themselves Illini. 
He called the region the land of the Illini, and he called the river upon which
he was floating the river of the Illini.When he asked the significance of
this name, he found it to be men, full grown, complete, or as we would say,
stalwart men.From this dusky race not only that river but our great state
takes its name.</p>

<p>There is scarcely an attribute of mankind so universal as that of affection for
the region in which our lot is cast; the land which has given birth, or which
in maturer years has received us to her bosom.The heart of the Esquimaux,
alike with the inhabitants of more favored regions, swells with the liveliest
emotions in contemplating what seem to him the beauties and excellencies of his
own country.If this emotion be an universal attribute to mankind, it cannot
fail to be more profound and intense in proportion as those beauties and
excellencies are real.There is no true son of Illinois
"Whose heart has ne'er within him burned "
in contemplating the sublime glories of his own state.</p>

<p>No other commonwealth can boast of more enterprising and prosperous cities and
towns and villages or of more delightful rural homes.Our great metropolis
with her magnificent buildings towering into the skies with her vast libraries
already provided for, with her university and institutes and schools, with her
charities and eleemosynary institutions, with her parks and great avenues, is
destined with the growth of architecture and the development of art to be the
most respondent city on the face of the earth.Millions of revolving wheels
are forever rolling to her great storehouses treasures
"Which far outshine the wealth of Ormus and of Ind ",
and she must very soon become the most opulent and popular city of the western
hemisphere, and finally of the world.</p>

<p>But it is of our complete, stalwart men that we are proud.They have shown
themselves worthy of the name they bear.Men "whose wrestling thews can throw
the world ".Scarcely had the people of Illinois begun to enjoy the privileges
and appreciate the glories of full citizenship of the republic when almost
immediately after the state was admitted into the union the demon of human
slavery tried to fasten itself upon them.Though most of them were from slave
states, they met and overcame the monster, and hurled it from them, banishing
it forever.A few years later, when borne down and overwhelmed with debt and
taxation, and the last hope of being able to extricate themselves seemed gone,
the siren of repudiation, as she has successfully done elsewhere beckoned them
to follow here for relief.They indignantly repelled here and deliberately, in
their fundamental law, put upon themselves a burden of taxation and, after
years of self-denial, paid the debt in full, dollar for dollar.When the
Mexican war came, Illinois carried the banner of the republic on many a
victorious battlefield, and finally assisted in dictating terms to the enemy in
his own capital.When human slavery sought to fasten itself upon California
and Kansas, Illinois men helped to drive it out.In the war of the rebellion
Illinois men "hewed their way down the Mississippi valley with their good
swords", as their greatest volunteer leader, whose achievements have been
commerated in bronze, said they would do, and teh great river flowed "unvexed
to the sea."</p>

<p>The names of the stalwart sons of Illinois who have won imperishable renown
would fill volumes.One of them conquered the sword of rebellion, and, with
magnanimity and generosity unequaled in history, declined to receive it, and
another is recognized throughout the world as the sublimest character of the
age.</p>

<p>While there is a tendency to exalt military genius above all other there have
been intellectual conflicts in which the laurels have been as resplendent as
those which deck the soldier's brow.In the great debates before the people of
Athens, Demosthenes gained renown which has brought his name down through all
the ages.</p>

<p>Just preceding the war of the rebellion, on the prairies of Illinois, we
witnessed a campaign of public discussion, continuing for several months.As
it progressed from day to day it attracted more and more attention until
finally all the people of the nation became interested.The great prairies
were the audience room, the American people the audience, the constitution of
the United States the platform, the greatest American statesman the champion,
and the fate of a continent the issue.</p>

<p>The original fabric of government was composed of states bordering upon the
Atlantic, of which the great state of Pennsylvania was appropriately designated
as the keystone.Soon the adventurous and hardy pioneer subdued the western
wilds, new states were formed and the republic expanded.By the Louisiana
purchase, the conquest of Mexico and the settlement of the Oregon boundary the
domains of the republic have extended until our boundaries are the oceans.Her
adamantine foundations, laid broad and deep, support the most majestic edifice
that has ever been projected.</p>

<p>In the midst of this mighty structure so amplified and extended from its
original boundaries Illinois appeared.Through the achievements and great
names of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant and the deeds of our other
statesmen and heroes Illinois has so risen in her central position that from
every quarter of the union men and women instinctively lift their eyes to her
and so carry out the now clearly discerned will of the divine architect.She
unites and cements and canopies with grace and symmetry and beauty the majestic
Pennsylvania was appropriately called the keystone, so Illinois may be
appropriately designated as the dome of the republic of the United States.</p>

<p>In the midst of this most splendid exposition of the world's progress that has
ever been attempted and carried out in the transmississippi region, equal, in
so far as designed, to the World's Columbian exposition and superior in many of
its details, Illinois has erected a building.In the work of laying out and
erecting this building the Illinois commissioners, representing every part of
the state, have taken a lively interest.It has been their desire to, without
unnecessary outlay, have a building that would be worthy of the state which has
honored them by placing the important trust in their hands.It has been a
labor of love, and they will feel amply compensated if their work is approved. 
For them and in their behalf, I now turn the building over to his excellency,
the governor of Illinois, whom I have the honor to present to you.</p>

<p>In introducing Governor Tanner, it is unnecessary for me to add more than a
word.Some of us have known him from the time when a mere lad he wore the blue
uniform of his country.We do not always agree with him, but we recognize his
sterling qualities.He learned from Abraham Lincoln to be just and kind and
considerate, and he learned from General Grant to keep steadily on in the line
of duty, unmoved by denunciation on the one hand, or by flattery on the other,
and he learned form John A. Logan, whose faithful and trusted companion he was,
to never desert a friend.He is one of the Illini.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>The address of Governor John M. Tanner was as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. President of the Illinois Commission and officers of the Transmississippi
Exposition:It affords me sincere pleasure on behalf of the state of Illinois
as its governor and executive head, to receive from the distinguished and
genial president of the Illinois Commission this commodious and elegant
building, which is not surpassed, I believe in point of beauty or convenience,
by any similar structure upon these capacious grounds.It is a building of
which the great state I have the honor here to represent may be justly proud
and I trust that many Illinoisans may see it, rest beneath its hospitable roof,
and share the sentiment of admiration and approval with which I view it for the
first time.</p>

<p>The people of Illinois have the most cordial and sympathetic feeling for the
state of Nebraska, and its citizens.They are largely the same people, since
Illinois has contributed so largely to populate these virgin and fertile
plains.I see in this audience of brave men and fair women many a spectator
and listenerwho was born in Illinois, but for one reason or another has cast
his or her lot with a younger community.To no other state in the union, I
think we have given so many of our sons and daughters.We cherish the belief
that even Nebraska can show none better.They are gone from us, but they are
still of us.Their memories are cherished by those whom they have left behind,
many of whom will take this opportunity to renew old ties of affection and
friendship.It is this common blood flowing through all our veins, much of it
inherited from early settlers of New England and Virginia and the Carolinas,
but all of it, whether its original source was in England, Ireland, Germany or
elsewhere, now thoroughly and forever American, which is the promise and pledge
of perpetual union of every portion of our common country.</p>

<p>The mention of our country at this moment of national peril and anxiety thrills
every patriotic heart.It is hard for us, far removed as we are from the
island shores in two hemispheres, where our destiny is even now being shaped to
some unseen end, by the thunderbolts of war, to command our thoughts and hold
them to the peaceful scenes which at home greet our view.In imagination and
sympathy we are only partly here.Our hearts are with our bravest and dearest
in camp or at sea, where the children of Illinois and the children of Nebraska
have joined hands to purchase, at the cost of their own lives, if so great a
sacrifice is required of them, the liberty and prosperity for an alien race
which we ourselves enjoy, and of which this magnificent exposition is the
latest and highest symbol.What a contrast!May we not derive from it the
lesson that greater are the triumphs of peace than of war?War is destructive
but peace is a creative force.</p>

<p>As I look around me I pray for the restoration of peace, a just and honorable
peace, a lasting peace, which shall usher in for all mankind a brighter era of
humanity and universal brotherhood.We can never be again what we have been -
an isolated nation, selfishly enjoying our immunity from international
responsibilities.We have a duty to discharge to the world as well as to
ourselves, and the destruction of the Maine with its gallant crew was the rude
voice which awakened us from our dream of perpetual exemption from entanglement
with the affairs of other nations, and aroused us to a higher conception of our
duty as to the pioneers of the new Christian civilization which is to
characterize the coming century.</p>

<p>But I have led away from the matter in hand.As governor of the state of
Illinois I congratulate the commission which has so well performed the task
assigned to it, of preparing and presenting a fit testimonial of our friendly
regard for a sister state, and our cordial sympathy with its noble ambitions.</p>

<p>I thank you for what you have done and now, in the name of this commission, and
on behalf of the people of Illinois, I tender to the officials in charge of the
transmississippi exposition, this edifice for the use of all who may enjoy its
hospitality, whether they be Nebraskans, Illinoisans, or from whatever state or
land they may come.Let Illinois and Nebraska vie with each other which of the
two shall give them the warmer welcome.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>At the close of Governor Tanner's address, Colonel Carr introduced Melville E.
Stone, manager of the Associated Press, who announced the receipt of a telegram
stating that General Shafter and his army had arrived off Santiago.This was
the signal for great cheering and enthusiasm.The band played "The
Star-Spangled Banner", and men and women mounted the seats and waived their
arms in the air.The Apollo Club sang "Illinois" and at its conclusion
"America", the audience joining in the national anthem.The Marine Band
rendered several selections and after the excitement had somewhat subsided,
President Wattles was introduced and spoke as follows:</p>

<p>When the Transmississippi Commercial Congress designated the city of Omaha as
the place at which the country beyond the Mississippi should display to the
world its resources in the year 1898, and when the officers of this exposition
had been designated we naturally turned to our neighbors of Illinois for
assistance and advice.We recognized as all must acknowledge, that Chicago had
furnished the ideal of all future expositions; that none could excel and few
could ever equal that grand achievement of human skill and genius, the "World
Columbian Fair".In architecture, arrangement and installation as well as in
the excellence variety and magnitude of the exhibits, we realize we could only
produce a shadow of that which had reached so near perfection at Chicago.</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure in the presence of His Excellency, the governor of
Illinois, and in the presence of these distinguished guests to acknowledge the
hearty cooperation we have received from the officers of the World's Fair
Commission and the valuable assistance of the state of Illinois to this
enterprise.Our invitation to your state to participate in this exposition was
promptly accepted, an appropriation was made by your legislature and a
beautiful and appropriate building has been erected on these grounds.I cannot
refrain from commending the efficient work done by your commissioners.Their
building is one of which the state may well be proud; they have furnished it
with comforts and conveniences, and have embellished with an artist's dream of
the "White City" in a manner which cannot fail to meet the approval of every
loyal citizen.This building is an honor to the state, Illinois, and a credit
to the exposition, and for the management I accept it and dedicate it to the
comfort and happiness of the citizens and all former residents of your great
state. </p>

<p>We of the vast Transmississippi region renew this day our allegiance and good
will to the state of Illinois and acknowledge our appreciation of the presence
of her governor and distinguished citizens here on this occasion.We are proud
of her history, her wealth, and of her great men, we are proud of her great
metropolis, the growth and development of which has been an index to the
progress of the entire west.The prosperity of Illinois and of her metropolis
is intimately associated with the prosperity of the transmississippi country. 
Chicago is the great clearing-house for the larger part of the surplus grain
and stock produced in the west.The value of her yearly commerce in the
necessities of life can hardly be compared.It exceeds the foreign exports of
the United States.It exceeds the entire annual gold and silver product of the
world.It exceeds the enormous sum of $1,000,000,000.For the product of the
west which yearly finds a market in the state of Illinois, her lines of
railroad which radiate to all parts of this country, return annually
agricultural implements to the value of $25,000,000, clothing to the value of
$50,000,000, boots and shoes to the value of $10,000,000,and the products of
her other factories in proportion.So active have become the demands of this
rapidly developing, pushing, thriving new territory, that the delay incident to
the purchase of factories in New England, cannot longer be tolerated and the
time is not far distant when the older states of the west will supply
themselves and their sister states with all their needs.The state of Illinois
is rapidly becoming a manufacturing center for the west.The census of 1890
showed an increase of 119% in her manufacturing interests in ten years. 
312,198 hands were then employed and the value of the annual product of her
factories was $908,640,000.I have no doubt that the next census will show a
corresponding increase.</p>

<p>But bound together as we are by the ties of commercial interest, there are
other cords that will forever hold us as brothers.The richest heritage of the
past century is the man which Illinois has given to history.They belong to
this and all other western states.They were the product of western
environment.Only the boundless prairies, the free air and the blue skies of
the west could have developed them.We have perpetuated their names in our
counties, cities and towns, and for the greatest and best of them all we have
named our capital city.They have made the state of Illinois renowned in
eloquence, learning, statesmanship and jurisprudence.Douglas the great
tribune, Baker the sweet-toned orator, Cartwright the rugged divine, Trumbull
the constitutional lawyer, Shields the hero of two wars, Drummond the eminent
judge, Logan, the "Black Eagle", who carried victory in his firy train, Oglesby
the unconquerable soldier and wise statesman, Grant the invincible leader of
armies, the peerless hero and the greatest general of the century, Lincoln, who
stood at the helm of the nation during the darkest hour of its peril and sealed
its triumph with his blood.We claim an interest in them all and their memory
must forever bind the state of Illinois with bonds of steel to the younger
states of the west.</p>

<p>We appreciate beyond expression this visit of your Governor and these
distinguished Illinois Citizens at this particular time.When war was first
declared with Spain the managers of this exposition had some fears that it
might detract from the success of our enterprise but we have come to realize
that blessings are often given in disguise.We now know that while war
destroys it also gives new life and that every citizen is energized by the new
and patriotic influences that are revived by conflict and strife.No better
illustration of the greatness and power of our country can be found than in the
fact that thousands of citizens from eastern states daily visit this exposition
and that while our antagonist - one of the oldest kingdoms in the world - is
straining every resource to meet in unequal combat our magnificent forces at
Manila and Santiago, that while the bonds of Spain are begging a market at
thirty cents on the dollar, our nation's war loan will be three times
over-subscribed by our own citizens and that we will not only defeat at arms
this dying relic of barbarism but at the same time will hold here in the center
of our territory a great exposition illustrating the arts of peace and
promoting good will throughout the land.</p>

<p>Illinois is bound to the west by ties of consanguinity and common interest. 
Thousands of her former citizens are now residents of this and other western
states, they are among our most progressive and prominent men in all
departments of business and professional life.Her beautiful home here will
renew old friendships and form new ones.I commend the wisdom of its erection,
the beauty of its design and the friendly interest which prompted its
conception.For the management of the exposition I receive and dedicate it for
the purpose for which it was designed.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>Governor Holcomb was then introduced and spoke briefly of the appreciation of
Nebraska for the substantial manner in which Illinois has assisted in making
the exposition a success.</p>

<p>Letters of regret were read from Senator W.E. Mason of Illinois, Alice Bradford
Willis, president of Illinois Federation of Women's Clubs, Robert T. Lincoln,
Carles G. Dawes, Joseph W. Pfeiffer and Adlai E. Stevenson.</p>

<p>The exercises were concluded by the address of former Governor Joseph L.
Beveridge, who spoke on the subject "Past and Present".His opening sentence
was "I lived for fifty years on the prairies of Illinois".He pictured with
much feeling and eloquence the changes that had been wrought in the west during
his lifetime.He told of the early privations and trials of the pioneers and
of their final triumphs and present prosperous conditions.With trembling
voice and prophetic language he pierced the future and described what might be
expected in the coming generations, and as he closed by chanting the Doxology,
the audience broke forth in cheer after cheer, and the exercises were concluded
amid great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In the evening a public reception was tendered to Mrs. Tanner and the visiting
ladies at the Illinois building from eight to ten o'clock, which was attended
by many pronounced a most successful function.</p>

<p>At 9 o'clock in the evening a musicale was given in the assembly room, in which
Mrs. Katherine Bloodgood, contralto, of New York, Mr. Justin M. Thatcher,
tenor, and Mr. Allan Spencer, pianist, of Chicago, took part.</p>

<p>A banquet was tendered by former Illinoisans now residing in Nebraska, at the
Markel Cafe, to the visitors in the evening, and was one of the most successful
social functions of the entire exposition.</p>

<p>KANSAS DEDICATION DAY.</p>

<p>June 22, 1898.</p>

<p>The Kansas Building was located in the southern part of the space set aside for
state buildings.It was a commodious and well planned structure, and was
erected by the Kansas Commission from funds raised by private subscriptions.</p>

<p>The exercises incident to dedicating the building were held at 11 o'clock A.M.
at the Kansas Building.A trumpet corps of the Boys' First Regiment of Topeka
played several selections, after which a male quartette from Topeka sang "The
Flag without a Stain".The following program of exercises was then given:</p>

<p>IOWA DEDICATION DAY.</p>

<p>June 23, 1898.</p>

<p>The Iowa Building occupied one of the most central locations in the tract set
aside for state buildings.The building faced east and its most prominent
feature was a large and commodious porch which afforded an inviting place for
visitors during the hot summer days.</p>

<p>The exercises were held at the Iowa Building at 2 o'clock P.M.The speakers
occupied the wide verandah in front of the center of the building, on which was
seated also the Dubuque Choral Club, Governor Leslie M. Shaw, Governor Silas A.
Holcomb of Nebraska, former Governor Alvin Saunders, the Members of the Iowa
Commission, and several members of the Exposition Executive Committee occupied
seats of honor.</p>

<p>The large concourse of people gathered in and about the building to hear the
exercises, which were of unusual interest.The program was as follows:</p>

<p>The address of the Hon. John N. Baldwin, the orator of the day, was in part as follows:</p>

<p>As I wandered through the exposition buildings and strolled over these grounds I heard orators proclaiming from the exedra, the plaza and rostrums in state buildings the glories and triumphs of their respective states.One evening after a storm I stood on the bridge of the lagoon but a few feet distant from the spot where only a year ago we laid the cornerstone of this great enterprise, and beholding this might monument to the skills, courage and enterprise of the men of Nebraska, I thought what has Iowa, or what has Iowa done to compare with this.</p>

<p>I came Nebraska Day and heard that distinguished citizen of the republic, whose
heart in love and tongue tipped with silver eloquently presented the record of
the resources and progress of Nebraska; I came Illinois Day and heard the
representatives of that great commonwealth give their report of the work and
worth of Illinois, concluding with the claim to the undisputed title to the
possession of the third greatest commercial center of the world; I imagined
that on New York Day Bourke Cochran would so portray the history and glories of
the great state of New York that we should all seem to hear the sybils chanting
the springtime of the greatest empire on earth.Again I thought, what has
Iowa, or what has Iowa done, to compare with all these?
Reflecting on all that I had seen and heard and imagined, I venerated my office
and would have despaired of my performance had not the power of my subject made
me bold in such a presence to plead my thoughts.It would be the drivel of
idiocy, unbecoming a gentleman and unworthy of the states, should I on this
occasion make any statement not based upon careful investigation and not
founded upon incontrovertible facts.I now and here assert, my heart beating
with pride at the utterance, that, measured by the standard of religion,
education, prosperity, patriotism, liberty, or any great principle or idea that
makes men better, nobler, and happier, Iowa, in the union of states, is the
peer of all, superior to many and excelled by none.</p>

<p>We dedicated today this beautiful building to the uses and purposes of the
Transmississippi and International Exposition.It is merely a type of the
habitations of our people at the present time.A few feet from here and within
your vision stands a wigwam, which has just been opened.It, too, is a type -a
type of the habitations of our people fifty-two years ago.You cannot but
recognize the significance of the change.The advancement, improvement, and
progress of the people of the state of Iowa in education, religion and material
interests has been as striking as that in their habitations.</p>

<p>This great state with its wondrous destinies is now in the hands of the younger and present generation? It belongs to us to protect, preserve and improve. We must take up the work where the pioneers were compelled to let it go. They placed high the standard.Let us never lower it.Let us look up and listen; look forward and move. Let our every notion be prompted and performed in accordance with that design created by one of the greatest philosophers and poets,</p>

<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">"Build thou more stately mansions, Oh my soul,</span>
<span class="l">As the swift seasons roll.</span>
<span class="l">Let each now temple, nobler than the last,</span>
<span class="l">Shut thy view from heaven with a dome more vast,</span>
<span class="l">Until at last thou art free,</span>
<span class="l">Leaving thy outgrown shell by life's unresting sea."</span></span>

<p>I propose this sentiment: The state of Iowa, with a people possessing
affections deeper even than her soil; actuated by purposes broader even than
her prairies, and inspired by aims loftier even than her hills, she stands
today first in the union of states in general contentment, in more evenly
distributed wealth, and in universal prosperity."</p>

<p>The exercises were closed by a short address by Governor Silas A. Holcomb, of Nebraska. At the conclusion of the formal program, luncheon was served to the speakers and distinguished guests by the Iowa Commission at the Markel Cafe.</p>

<p>At 5:30 P.M. a reception was given in honor of Governor and Mrs. Shaw, at the Iowa building.</p>

<p>At one o'clock P.M. many citizens of Council Bluffs and other points in Iowa,
gathered at the building known as the Pottawattamie County Wigwam, which was a
peculiar structure patterned after an immense Indian wigwam.It was dedicated
with formal ceremony, which included prayer by Rev. G.W. Snyder of Council
Bluffs, and an address by Mayor Victor Jennings of Council Bluffs; an address
by Spencer Smith of Council Bluffs; an address by Judge Walter I. Smith of
Council Bluffs and music by the Apollo Mandolin Club of Council Bluffs.</p>

<p>SWEDISH-AMERICAN DAY.</p>

<p>June 24, 1898.</p>

<p>For the celebration of Swedish-American Day was planned a great meeting in the Auditorium in the evening. A song festival of music by famous Swedish voices in their native tongue. During the day preceding the evening which had been set aside for this celebration, the grounds and buildings were noticeably filled with men and women who had gathered from Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska, to take part in this celebration.The formal program was given in the Auditorium, at 8 o'clock P.M.The exercises were opened by President C.O. Lobeck, who introduced President Gurdon W. Wattles, who in a few remarks welcomed the visitors to the White City. An address in the Swedish language was made by Rev. A.J. Lofgren, of Lincoln, presiding elder of the Swedish-American Church, after which the musical program was rendered, as follows:</p>

<p>ROYAL ARCANUM DAY.</p>

<p>June 25, 1898.</p>

<p>This was the first special day set aside for the celebration of secret
societies, and while no exercises in the way of speech making or music marked
the celebration of the members of this organization who gathered in large
numbers on the exposition grounds and were in evidence during the afternoon and
evening concerts.The local Councils as also the Councils of South Omaha and
Council Bluffs were well represented.Arlington and numerous other towns
adjacent to Omaha were also represented, and the day proved a decided success.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter doublespace ">

<p>MONTANA DEDICATION DAY.</p>

<p>June 29, 1898.</p>

<p>The location of the Montana building gave it prominence, being on the main
avenue leading south from the esplanade, and near the entrance to the Bluff
Tract from Sherman Avenue.The building was well arranged, and under the able
supervision of Mr. W.H. Sutherlin, Exposition vice-president for Montana.The
Montana building and exhibit, both of which reflected great credit on the
state, were made possible by the liberal donation of Mr. Marcus Dailey, who
pledged the delegation that visited Montana to promote the exposition in the
winter of 1897, a donation of $15,000; the legislature afterwards appropriated
a like amount, and the exhibits from that state and the building erected by the
Commission were placed in charge of vice-president Sutherlin.</p>

<p>The exercises dedicating the building to the uses for which it had been
erected, were held at 4 o'clock P.M., and while simple, were impressive.The
program consisted of a short address by Vice-president Sutherlin, several
musical selections, and an address by President Gurdon W. Wattles, and were
concluded by a luncheon served by the Montana Commission.</p>

<p>TURNERS DAY AND MUSICAL CONGRESS DAY.</p>

<p>June 30, 1898.</p>

<p>For many weeks the Tuners of Omaha and many other cities throughout the west,
had looked forward to this celebration and the drills for prizes that were to
take place on the exposition grounds, with much interest.They gathered early
and in large numbers.The principal drill was at 6 o'clock in the evening on
the plaza.In this drill about 400 Turners participated.Other exercises were
had and withal the day proved a great success.</p>

<p>THE MUSICAL CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The principal sessions of the Musical congress were held in the First
Congregational Church of Omaha, but the principal musical feature of the
Congress was the Oratorio of Isaiah, written and rendered by American singers
in the Auditorium building in the evening.Mr. Willard Patten, the composer,
and his Minneapolis choral organization of 250 voices came by special train for
this rendition.The orchestral features were rendered by the entire Theodore
Thomas Orchestra, and the following soloists participated:Mrs. Genevieve
Clark Wilson, Chicago, soprano; Miss Katharine Fiske, New York, contralto; Mr.
Frederick Carberry, Chicago, tenor; Mr. Charles Clarke, Chicago, baritone.The
audience taxed the capacity of the large auditorium and the enthusiasm was
strong and spontaneous.</p>

<p>The interest in all the meetings of the Musical Congress was great and the
results were most satisfactory to all musicians.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winona S. Sawyer of the bureau of education, speaking of the aims and
purposes of the bureau in arranging a musical congress in connection with the
exposition, said, among other things:</p>

<p>"With the first month of the Exposition as a prelude to a grand symphony, the
beauty of the architecture and the arrangement of the buildings, suggestive of
the allegro movement; the labor of patience and anxiety requisite to secure
these results, typical of the andante; the entertainment, amusement and
pleasure intimating the scherzo movement; we prize this Congress coming at this
time.It stands out like a fugue subject, with strong marked features of lofty
inspiration and high ideals, which once introduced, will be again and again
taken up and repeated successively in various keys and various harmonies
throughout the exposition."</p>

<p>TEXAS MELON DAY.</p>

<p>July 1, 1898.</p>

<p>The Texas Exposition Commission, supplementing their general exhibit at the
exposition, set apart this day to show to the world the beauty and demonstrate
the good quality of their product of water melons.Twelve hundred melons were
provided for the feast, which occurred at 5 o'clock P.M.The distribution was
made the occasion for brief ceremonies at the horticultural building.</p>

<p>S.J.T. Johnson, exposition vice-president for Texas, and Superintendent
Atwater, in charge of the Texas exhibits, made short addresses, which were
responded to on behalf of the exposition by General Manager T.S. Clarkson. 
This concluded the formalities of the occasion.</p>

<p>Long tables had been provided, upon which to carve and serve the luscious
fruit, and a force under the direction of Arthur Nelson, superintendent of the
Missouri horticultural exhibit, was kept busy until the last melon had vanished
from sight.Some of the melons weighed nearly 40 pounds and it was estimated
that 10000 persons were served during the feast.</p>

<p>NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES.</p>

<p>July 2, 1898.</p>

<p>A large number of delegates en route to the meeting of the national council of
Congregational Churches to be held at Portland, Oregon, stopped at Omaha to
visit the exposition and the local society made their visit the occasion of a
special gathering and demonstration at the Boys' and Girls' Building on the
Exposition Grounds.</p>

<p>There were about 150 prominent clergymen from eastern cities, besides many of
their friends and laymen and the auditorium of the Boys' and Girls' building
was well filled when they gathered at 4 o'clock for the brief exercises and
exchange of formalities.</p>

<p>Reverend S. Wright Butler presided and by his many witticisms kept the audience
in good humor.He introduced President Wattles, who extended a hearty welcome
to the distinguished guests.</p>

<p>Ex-Governor Coffin, of Connecticut, responded briefly.A vote of thanks was
then moved by Dr. Hazen to the people of Omaha and to the exposition management
for the generous entertainment which had been accorded.Dr. Lamson of Hartford
closed the speaking.The music of the day was rendered by Mrs. G.W. Johnson,
Miss Kellogg and Mrs. A.G. Edwards, all of Omaha.</p>

<p>INDEPENDENCE DAY.</p>

<p>July 4, 1898.</p>

<p>Great preparations had been made for a fitting celebration of the National
Holiday, and the early morning found all means of transportation to the
exposition grounds crowded by the anxious throngs which came early, many of
them from adjoining states, to see for the first time the exposition, and it
soon became evident that this was to be the day of largest attendance on the
exposition grounds.</p>

<p>The program planned included a paraade of the Midway features under the command
of General Manager Clarkson.At 10 o'clock the parade marched through the
avenues on the bluff tract headed by the Exposition Guards and the Exposition
Band; Frank C. Bostock, with numerous aides commanded no less than five
divisions, including nearly all of the Exposition Midway attractions and many
novelty features, and was reviewed by the Exposition Officials, the
distinguished guests and speakers of the day, from the Music Pavillion.</p>

<p>After the parade the exercises of the day were held from the Music Pavilion,
and consisted of the following program:</p>

<p>Music by Fourth Regiment Band of Sioux City, Iowa,after which an interesting
innovation occurred by the announcement by President Wattles of the receipt of
a telegam stating that General Shafter had demanded unconditional surrender of
the Spanish troops of Santiago.
Prayer was then offered by Rev. T.J. Mackey.The Exposition Chorus sang
"America".The Declaration of Independence was read by Hon. John C. Wharton,
and the orator of the day, Hon. James M. Beck, was then introduced and spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>"AS AN EAGLE STIRRETH UP HER NEST".</p>

<p>My Fellow Countrymen:</p>

<p>From the city of the Declaration of Independence where Henry spoke, Jefferson
wrote, Franklin counseled, Adams debated, Morris administered, and Washington
unsheathed his sword, within whose walls is Germantown, and near to whose gates
are Brandywine and Valley Forge, I bring you a fraternal greeting. 
Philadelphia felicitates Omaha.Pennsylvania salutes Nebraska and her sisters
of the Great West.They congratulate you on this imposing pageant of art and
industry, representing the resources of a section, over which, when the great
Declaration was given to the world, the banner of Spain floated in triumph. 
Its marvelous growth, under free institutions is a vindication beyond the power
of mere words, of those sublime truths, to which our fathers gave undying
expression one hundred and twenty-two years ago to-day.</p>

<p>In the contrasts of history can be often seen the divine purpose, which runs
through the ages.When La Salle, in 1682, traversed the Mississippi, and,
standing at its mouth, claimed the vast territory which it drained for his
royal master, and named it in his honor "Louisiana", the grand monarque was
even then constructing in the insolence of his unbridled power, and on a scale
of imperial magnificence, the palace of Versailles.Its splashing fountains,
endless chambers of crystal, flowery parterres, and gorgeous frescoes
proclaimed the power of the so-called "Sun King", whose "l'Etat c'est Moi", was
the extreme of regal despotism. Later, this Trans-Mississippi region, after
languishing beneath the yoke of the Spanish Bourbons, became part of Napoleon's
dream of universal empire.It is an inspiring reflection that the hand, which
drafted the Declaration of Independence, rescued this vast empire form the iron
grasp of the modern Caesar, and dedicated it to free institutions forever more. 
Vanished is the power of the "Sun King," Spanish Bourbon, and the
granite-souled Emperor.The tyranny which created that wonderful apotheosis of
personal absolutism, the palace of Versailles, has been swept away by the
dynamic force of democratic ideas, and today in this region, once believed to
be a desert, but now the home of twenty-two millions of freemen, the people
have erected these splendid palaces of triumphant democracy.</p>

<p>We can reverently thank the Ruler of Nations, by Whose ordinanace the Republic
came into being and to serve Whose wise purposes it continues to exist, that
upon no preceding anniversary has our country exercised so wide an influence
among the nations of the earth, or used it for any loftier or nobler purpose. 
The Republic is in arms today, not because it loves peace less, but because it
loves justice more.Never did nation make war with a less selfish purpose. 
The American people, until patience had ceased to be a virtue, sympathized with
their noble President in the wish that this cup of bitterness might be spared
our lips.No lust of military glory or territorial aggrandizement inspired our
action.We had been slow to believe the oft-repeated stories of mediaeval
barbarities in Cuba, and our traditional policy was opposed to intervention in
the domestic affairs of another Power.A certain spirit of noblesse oblige
restrained us from striking a weaker foe even in a just cause.It was not
until a daughter of Nebraska had died in Cuban waters, and her husband, its
honored Senator, had, in a speech of great eloquence and yet greater pathos,
given us "the true and sensible avouch of his own eyes", that our pacific
purposes gave place to the passionate indignation of freemen, that the spirit
of the Crusaders swept through our veins, and the cry "God wills it", was heard
on every hand.We then took a high resolve in the spirit of our fathers, that
our blood should be as dust and our treasure as water to stop this barbarity
forever.We have thus disproved the libel against the American character, that
our aims are purely material, and that our unequaled growth in wealth has
choked the finer sensibilities of the soul.Let those who heard unheeded the
moan of Cretan and the death rattle of the Armenian, and yet taunted us with
the blind worship of wealth, forever hold their peace.We have vindicated the
rights of humanity and shown that there is one nation, whose conscience is not
dead, and of whom it cannot be truly said that the "age of chivalry is gone and
one of calculators and economists has succeeded.We are moved by his spirit,
who a generation ago believed that the elemental demands of justice rose higher
than mere form, precedent, or convention.Though dead, John Brown yet
speaketh, and "his soul is marching on."The old bell, which more than a
century ago rang out our freedom, though mute to the ear of flesh, is still
grandly proclaiming, even to the islands of the sea, "liberty throughout all
the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof."</p>

<p>As we meet this morning, we can give especial thanks for the swift and
triumphant vindication of our cause.With the proud fleet of Cervera
annihilated and Santiago doomed, the vulture of Spanish oppression lies
prostrate under the talons of the eagle.Again the great Declaration, whose
basic principle is the political equality of the individual, has been justified
in the splendid manhood and invincible bravery of our soldiers and sailors. 
With fear and trembling many awaited the dawn of this day, lest our brave sons
at Santiago, facing a hidden and powerful foe under conditions of unparalleled
difficulty, should be betrayed into disaster by their very confidence.But
fear is past and only the songs of triumph are now heard throughout the land. 
The citizen soldiery of the Republic, at whose martial prowess supercilious
foreign critics sneered, have again given immortal proof to the world that "our
flag is still there."</p>

<p>Our rejoicing, however, may well be tempered today by the appreciation of the
tremendous responsibilities, which by no wish or purpose of ours are suddenly
devolved upon us.Dewey's genius and valor not unworthy of a land which gave
Paul Jones, Greble, Bainbridge, Decatur, Porter, and Farragut to history - have
blazed the path to victory and have confronted the American people with a
responsibility more momentous and pregnant with future consequences than has
ever weighed upon our nation on any national anniversary since the Civil War. 
That involved our existence, this may define our position and relations to the
rest of the world.To give back the conquered territory to Spain may be to
subject a weak and helpless people to its vindictive revenge; to give these
various possessions in two hemispheres to their own people may be to make them
the prey for the powers of Europe, whose selfish greed for territory is now
finding expression in China; for us to surrender these conquered islands to any
other nation is to incur the enmity of the rest, and perhaps involved
civilization in a war, which might wrap the world in its devouring flame, and
yet, - to permanently annex them to the Republic is to cross a greater Rubicon
than that at whose brink even Caesar halted, and with consequences scarcely
less momentous.Jefferson's words to James Monroe, which inspired the Monroe
Doctrine, may well be recalled as applicable to the present crisis in our
national life."The question," said he, "is the most momentous, which has ever
been offered to my contemplation since that of independence; that made us a
nation, this sets our compass and points the course which we are to steer
through the ocean of time opening on us."
Is the Western Hemisphere large enough for the influence and progress of the
American people, or must we surrender, commercially and politically, our policy
of isolation and claim an influence which shall be as limitless as the world is
round?The Atlantic coast was our cradle, lusty youth found us on the banks of
the Mississippi, vigorous maturity has brought us to the Pacific.What of that
momentous morrow - the twentieth century?Are we, like Alexander, to stop at
the margin of the sea and mourn that it forever bars our further progress, or
are we, like the inspired pilot of Genoa, to launch the bark of our national
destiny into an unknown sea, in search of new and untried routes to national
prosperity?</p>

<p>Well may we, my fellow countrymen, in this great crisis of our national life,
remember the beginning of the Republic and the teachings of our fathers.Such
remembrance is not merely a grateful tribute to the dead, but will help us
discharge our duty to the unborn.Let us, then, in the spirit of the great law giver and leader of an oppressed people.</p>

<p>"Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations.
"As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings.
"So the Lord alone did lead him and there and was no strange God with him."</p>

<p>This very striking metaphor of Moses suggests a great truth in connection with
our development as a nation, that it has never been permitted to remain long
within the nest of any traditional policy.There is a natural conservatism in
the Anglo-Saxon race, and a distrust and dread of innovation.It has ever been
slow to leave the beaten paths of the fathers.Nor need this be deprecated,
for it ensures a reasonable continuity of policy.Every great step forward has
been due, not to the leadership of our great men, nor to any conscious and
deliberate purpose of the people, but wholly to a divine guidance, which,
working through the force of unforeseen circumstances, and a certain
unconscious intuitive impulse of the masses, has destroyed the nest of
tradition and thrust us as young eagles into the void.The great actors of the
revolutionary epic had their traditions, and an ancestry in which they gloried,
and yet were forced by the logic of events to disregard both.Their
traditional policy was loyalty to the King, hatred of France, with whom they
had contested for the possession of North America, pride in the English Empire,
and disinclination towards any union between themselves.When the Revolution
broke out nothing was further from their purpose than separation from England. 
Said John Adams:"There was not a moment during the Revolution when I would
not have given everything I possessed for a restoration to the state of things
before the contest began, provided we could have had a sufficient security for
its continuance."Dr. Franklin, the most trusted, sagacious, and far-seeing
statesman of his generation, said before the battle for a separation, or a hint
that such a thing would be advantageous to America."Mr. Jay said:"During
the course of my life, and until the second petition of Congress in 1775, I
never had heard an American of any class, or of any description, express a wish
for the independence of the Colonies."The author of the Declaration of
Independence said:"It has always been, and still is, my opinion and belief
that our country was prompted and impelled to independence by necessity, not by
choice.I never heard a whisper, before the commencement of hostilities, of a
disposition to separate from Great Britain."Washington in 1774, denounced as
"malevolent falsehoods" the assertions that "There is any intention in the
American colonies to set up for independent States."In 1776 he wrote:When I
took command of the army I abhorred the idea of independence; now I am
convinced nothing else will save us."</p>

<p>"Building better than they knew" - as all master builders of a nation - our
fathers were led, by impulses which they could not appreciate or understand, to
disregard every tradition which they held dear, to renounce allegiance to the
King, separate from the great English Empire, make formal alliance with their
hated enemy, France, and create a union of which each had been but too jealous.</p>

<p>The Constitution of the United States was not the deliberate wish of the
people, but was created by their necessities; it met no one's entire approval,
was only adopted after bitter debates of four months duration, and was the
result of a compromise begotten by the stern and pressing necessities of the
situation.Only a choice between chaos and a Constitution induced the jarring,
discordant and jealous States to surrender any portion of their sovereignty,
and yet this Constitution, in its present form the child of no brain and the
creation of no wish, is the admiration of the world, and has been pronounced by
the noblest and most scholarly statesman of our time, whose death we even now
mourn, to have been the most perfect ever struck off by the brain and purpose
of man at a given time.</p>

<p>Nor has this truth been less marked in our own time and generation.The
Emancipation Proclamation clearly violated the traditional policy of our
country, which recognized the existence of slavery.Jefferson'sstern
denunciation of the slave trade, which he had inserted in the first draft of
the great Declaration, was stricken out by Congress, and the Constitution
itself distinctly recognized the existence of this baleful domestic
institution.Its destruction was not due to the conscious and deliberate
purpose of any statesman.Lincoln at the beginning of his administration
distinctly disclaimed any purpose to interfere with it, and it was not until
the blood, which had been shed from Bull Run to Antietam, cried as from the
ground that again the nest of tradition was destroyed and the eagle essayed a new and nobler flight.No one recognized this more clearly than did the great war President, and in his second inaugural he plainly voiced his belief that not only the removal of slavery but the Civil War itself had come by no human wisdom, but by a divine judgment.</p>

<p>The same momentous fact is true today.Once again the nation feels a
mysterious and puissant impulse.It has ever been the traditional policy of
the Republic not to interfere in the domestic affairs of a friendly Power, and
the Monroe Doctrine distinctly disclaimed any intention to interfere with
existing colonial dependencies in America of European Powers, but as Lexington
inflamed a continent and created a new nation, as Fort Sumter rudely shattered
our dream of peace and compelled us to remove by the sword the running sore of
slavery, the explosion of the Maine and the cruelties to the Cuban people have
compelled us to discard our traditional and valued policy of non-interference,
and directly interfere with the domestic affairs of another nation.</p>

<p>We need not regret the transitory influence of the past.Blind adherence to
tradition is not the highest patriotism, but is a form of intellectual slavery
not worthy of a free and progressive people.An assumption that the teachings
of our fathers expressed the finality of political wisdom is contradicted by
the uniform experience of mankind.I yield to no one in my reverential respect
for the founders of this Republic.No Government has had greater men, and
History can be searched in vain for any loftier lives or wiser minds than
Washington and Franklin, Jefferson and Hamilton, Madison and Monroe.The
eloquent judgment of the elder Chatham has received the considerate approval of
mankind, when, speaking of the first Continental Congress, he said, "I must
declare and vow that in all my reading and study- and I have read Thucydides
and have studied and admired the master States of the world- that for solidity
of reason, force of sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion, under such a
complication of circumstances, no nation or body of men can stand in preference
to the General Congress at Philadelphia."Nevertheless the Almighty never
intended that wisdom should die either with one man, one generation, one race,
one century, or one epoch.Least of any people should America doubt the
"increasing purpose" of the ages and the widening of thought "with the process
of the suns."</p>

<p>Because our fathers thought that the stage coach was adequate to their needs,
shall we abandon the locomotive?The old wooden battleships, such as the "Bon
Homme Richard " and the "Constitution", won imperishable laurels for the
American Navy, but shall we therefore place these obsolete sailing vessels in
conflict with modern steel battleships?Because the Continentals defended
Bunker Hill and achieved the crowning triumph of Yorktown with flint-lock
muskets, shall we discard the repeating rifle?If Franklin impressed his
personality upon the world with a hand-press, shall we less avail ourselves of
those throbbing engines which make possible the modern newspaper?Our fathers
recognized that wise nations, as wise individuals, change their minds when
occasion justifies, but fools never.Let us not ascribe to them an
infallibility which they do not claim for themselves.Democracy acknowledges
no living sovereign, much less those who are said to "rule us form their urns." 
The decadence of Spain, which has cost her the empire of the world, and now
brought her to the verge of final ruin, is due to her "inordinate tenacity of
old opinions, old beliefs, and hold habits," which Buckle finds to be her
predominant national characteristic.He adds:"By encouraging the notion that
all the truths most important to know are already known, they repress those
aspirations and dull that generous confidence in the future without which
nothing really great can be achieved.A people who regard the past with too
wistful an eye will never bestir themselves to help the onward progress.To
them antiquity is wisdom, and every improvement is a dangerous innovation." 
The nation which has most consistently and continuously followed the worship of
ancestry is China, and as a result it is today the helpless prey of other
Powers, although in numbers and resources it is potentially the most powerful
on the earth.</p>

<p>We must not as a people permit the past to fetter the present.That way
retrogression lies, and our duty as a nation is to be determined by the
present, not by past conditions.We cannot even stand still.We must move
onward.From civilization we derive inestimable rights, to her we owe
immeasurable duties, and to shirk these is cowardice and moral death.No
nation can live to itself, even if it would.The economic developments of the
nineteenth century have produced a solidarity of humanity, which no racial
prejudice or international hatred can destroy.Each nation is its brother's
keeper, and the greater the power, the greater the responsibility.If this be
so, no nation owes a great duty to civilization to be potential in the councils
of the world than the United States.For it to skulk and shirk behind the
selfish policy of isolation and to abdicate a destined world supremacy, would
be the colossal crime of history.God has given us the power, woe be unto us
if we do not use it.The stern but just law, which has governed the nations in
all history, is that he alone shall have, who uses.Its ethical sanction is
found in that parable of the talents, in which the Great Teacher laid down the
moral law that no man or nation has an indefeasible title to property,that
all is holden of God, and tenure depends upon rightful use.From Spain, as
from an unprofitable and slothful servant, are about to be taken colonies which
she has failed to develop in harmony with modern progress.Let our people,
instead of questioning the law, remember that we too shall perish when we cease
to develop the talents committed to our charge.Of every rotten tree the
eternal inquiry of the Great Woodman is heard, "Why cumbereth it the ground?"</p>

<p>In discussing any questions, therefore, which may result from the present war
with Spain, let us not give undue or conclusive value to the opinions of the
past.The conditions under which we must act are essentially different from
those which existed in our father's time, and the poet of democracy said
nothing more worthy of remembrance by us a people than that-</p>

<p>"New occasions teach new duties; time makes ancient good uncouth; 
They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast
of truth."</p>

<p>Steam and electricity have destroyed our "distant and detached position," of
which Washington spoke in the immortal Farewell Address, and upon which he
predicated in the infancy of the Republic a policy of isolation.Then we were
the weakest Power in the world, today we are the strongest.Then we were three
millions in number, scattered over three hundred thousand square miles of
territory, today we are seventy-five millions of people, inhabiting a continent
from ocean to ocean, fronting the Orient and the Occident, and possessed of
resources which are inexhaustible.Then we were almost exclusively an
agricultural country, today we are the greatest agricultural, mining, and
manufacturing nation of the globe, and second only to England in commercial
prestige.Then it required five weeks to visit or communicate with Europe, and
the Atlantic Ocean seemed a natural barrier, today we can flash a message
around the world in a few hours, and can learn of its affairs almost as they
occur.The citizen of New York can today reach London with more facility than
the first President could leave Mount Vernon and proceed to Philadelphia. 
When, therefore, Washington, at a time when the great European Powers had been
thrown by the French Revolution into a state of chaos, advised the infant
Republic, newest among nations and weakest in credit, numbers and resources, to
avoid any interference in the affairs of the greater world beyond the seas,
lest as a lamb it should be devoured by a pack of wolves, he counseled, as he
always did, with a wisdom unimpeachable; but those who would forever keep the
Republic in her swaddling clothes, and who for this purpose invoke the great
name of Washington, should first convince us that if he were the President of
the most powerful nation in the world he would advise it to yield precedence to
lesser and weaker Powers.Would he not feel that this Colossus among nations
should not lisp in the language of its infancy, but should say with St. Paul,
"When I was a child I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a
child, but when I became a man I put away childish things."</p>

<p>Out nation is today feeling that instinct of expansion, which is the
predominant characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race.It is bred in our bone and
courses with our lifeblood, and the statesmen of our day must take it into
account and endeavor to wisely control it.There is with us, as with our great
mother empire, a national instinct for territorial growth, "so powerful and
accurate, that statesmen of every school, willing or unwilling, have found
themselves carried along by a tendency which no individuality can resist or
greatly modify."We could as hopefully bid the Mississippi cease its flow
toward the sea, or the Missouri to remain chained within its rocky sources, as
to prevent the onward movement of this great, proud, generous, and aggressive
people.This was true of the day of our weakness, it is true in this, the day
of our strength.</p>

<p>The first effort of the newly recognized Republic was to acquire territory. 
When at the close of the Revolution our peace commissioners met in Paris, the
problem arose as to the true boundaries of the new nation.We have solemnly
convenanted with France that we would not sign any treaty of peace with England
unless our ally concurred.France insisted that the vast area between the
rivers, which flowed into the Atlantic, and the Mississippi, was Spanish
territory.Our commissioners felt that our national destiny justified a claim
to the east bank of the Mississippi, and they so far "stooped to conquer" as to
secretly execute without the knowledge or concurrence of France, a treaty with
England, which gave us the territory to the Father of Waters.Congress at
first was disposed to condemn this act of their commissioners, and disclaim the
territory beyond the Alleghenies, which were felt by many to be the boundaries
which Nature had set to the advance of the Republic.The most radical agreed
that the Mississippi was our true boundary, and yet the commercial necessity of
its free navigation caused our fathers, a few years later, to reverse this
narrow conception of their national destiny, and constrained as sincere and
lofty a statesman as Jefferson to sacrifice his cherished theories as to the
constitutional powers of the Federal government by purchasing on his own
responsibility, and without the authority of either the Constitution or of
Congress, this great empire between the Mississippi and the Pacific.A great
party vainly opposed the purchase of this region, and in so doing, destroyed
only itself.Speaking in one of its thirty great opulent cities, at an
Exposition which represents the resources of its twenty-two millions of
freemen, let me quote the words of Senator White spoken on the floor of the
Senate in 1803.He said:"But as to Louisiana, this new, immense, unbounded
world, if it should ever be incorporated into this Union which I have no idea
can be done, but by altering the Constitution, I believe it will be the
greatest curse that could at present befall us.It may be productive of
innumerable evils, and especially one that I even fear to look upon."And then
he added, "Gentlemen on all sides, with very few exceptions agree that the
settlement of this country will be highly injurious and dangerous to the United
States.***We have already territory enough, and when I contemplate the
evils that may arise to these states from this intended corporation of
Louisiana into the Union, I would rather see it given to France, to Spain or to
any other nation of the earth, upon the mere condition that no citizen of the
United States should ever settle within its limits, than to see the territory,
sold for $100,000,000, and we retain the sovereignty."</p>

<p>The opposition to the acquisition of Louisiana was repeated in the matter of
the disputed territory of Oregon, which an influential Senator said was "not
worth a pinch of snuff," and but for Whitman's perilous journey across the
Continent, would have been forever lost to the Union; but the impulse of our
people towards expansion triumphed in the matter of Louisiana and Oregon, as
also in that of Texas, California and Alaska, and today our territorial
possessions stretch so far into the Pacific, that the sum which casts its last
rays upon the farthest Aleutian Island is already illumining the rocky coast of
Maine.San Francisco, once our western limit, is now but midway between our
eastern and western possessions, and the shores of Puget Sound, originally our
most northern frontier, are now more than a thousand miles south of that final
shore, which stretches toward the Pole and into the Arctic Ocean.

I would not be understood as arguing in favor of the annexation of any of the
islands, of which we have taken possession for the purposes of the war, or
indeed of any policy of indiscriminate territorial acquisition.These are
questions about which men of equal intelligence and patriotism may reasonably
differ, and both the limitations and the proprieties of the occasion forbid
their discussion.I have been protesting, however, against the tyranny of
tradition, intellectual slavery, which compels obedience to past ideals, and
the assumption that there should be any policy which forbids the further
expansion of the republic.</p>

<p>Let us equally beware of that fatal error of empires and Republics, that a
nation is necessarily great in proportion to its area and population.To no
principle of public policy has history given a more uniform and emphatic
contradiction.As Mr. Lowell has beautifully said, "The greatness of a nation
is weighed in scales more delicate than the balance of trade.On the maps you
can cover Athens with a pin point and Judea with a finger tip, and yet in those
magnificent places impulses have been given which have not ceased to direct
civilization."If mere numbers and area determined greatness, China would be
the greatest nation in the world, and yet greater than all Cathay was that
little capital of Attica, Athens, which has flamed as a torch of culture over
the ages, and lives in memory as the "City of the violet crown."Expansion is
not necessarily strength, but may involve weakness, and we should not add to
our already onerous responsibilities without undoubted compensatory advantages,
or unless our duty to humanity clearly requires us to take weaker nations under
our fostering influence.</p>

<p>There is one tradition of our fathers, which we cannot too strictly respect,
and whose value time cannot "wither nor custom stale."It is the spirit of
justice, to which, by that instrument whose adoption we celebrate today, our
country is solemnly dedicated forevermore.The richest country in the world,
though it were paved with gold, were dear enough, if purchased at the price of
this ideal.In achieving its high destiny the Republic must therefore respect
the noble and cosmopolitan spirit in which it was formed.To appreciate it we
must comprehend the meaning and purposed of the Declaration.It is commonly
believed that it is noteworthy in our annals, because by that instrument, and
on the day on which it was proclaimed, our country severed its relations with
Great Britain.This is a mistake.The formal act of severance from Great
Britain did not occur on the Fourth of July nor by the Declaration.One June
7th, 1776, Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, at the instance of Virginia,
introduced his three famous resolutions, the first of which was, "That these
United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states,
that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that the
political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought
to be totally absolved."They were debated with great earnestness on the 8th
and 10th of June, by which time it became clear that a majority of the colonies
was prepared to adopt them, but for the sake of greater unanimity, the
consideration of the question was postponed until July 1st, and the committee
composed of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman and
Robert R. Livingston, was appointed to prepare a formal declaration to the
world.On the first day of July, Congress, sitting as a committee of the
whole, resumed consideration of the question and it was passed by the
committee.On the following day, July 2, 1776, Rodney having "come post from
the Delaware Counties," and Pennsylvania having changed her vote, the House
unanimously adopted the original resolution.If, therefore, the commencement
of the republic is to date from the formal resolution of severance rather than
from the real severance, which commenced with the first Continental Congress,
then on July 2nd, 1776, the United States began their separate and independent
existence.This was clearly the belief of those who participated in the
proceedings, and was expressed by John Adams in his memorable letter of July
3rd, 1776, to his wife, when he said, "But the day is past.The second day of
July, 1776, will be a memorable epoch in the history of America.I am apt to
believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great
anniversary festival.It ought to be commemorated, as the day of deliverance,
by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.***You may think me
transported with enthusiasm, but I am not; I am well aware of the toil and
blood and treasure that it will cost us to maintain this declaration, and
support and defend these states, yet through all the gloom I can see the rays
of light and glory."</p>

<p>What, then, was the purpose of the great Declaration, and what has given it not
only undying significance for all future time, but especial value for us today? 
It was this:Our fathers appreciated that their act was essentially
revolutionary, that it had no sanction in any code of municipal or
international law, and that its only justification must be found in that higher
law of the human conscience by which in the last analysis all political acts
must be judged.They therefore felt that their action required formal
justification, and it was for the purpose of satisfying the conscience of
mankind as to the justice of an act essentially revolutionized that the
Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4th, 1776.It was not,
therefore, intended for the colonists.For them a recital of their grievances
was superfluous, for the wrongs done them were ineffaceably seared into their
memories.Nor was the Declaration an appeal to public sentiment in England,
for their "humble petition" of 1776 had been contemptuously spurned both by the
King and his subservient Parliament.</p>

<p>Our fathers felt that further discussion with England was useless.Its purpose
was, therefore, to solemnly challenge the justice of the world to the necessity
of the separation.This is clearly shown by its noble preamble:"When, in the
course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the
political bands which have connected them with another,*** a decent
respect to the opinion of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the separation."This paper, therefore, assumes - vainly
as it then seemed, in an age in which might was supposed to make right - that
there was a law of right and wrong, rising higher than laws, precedents, or
conventions, regulated the intercourse of nations as well as individuals.It
believed in moral responsibility for nations as for men, and it avowed a belief
in a great human conscience which, towering above the selfish interest of
nations and races, would approve the right and condemn the wrong.It assumed
that this approval was more to be desired than national advantage.It
established civilization as a judge between contending nations, with posterity
as a court of last resort.It proclaimed the solidarity of humanity, and
placed it higher than the tie of nationality; it argued-not with the ethics of
a rifle or the morality of the cannon only-but with the power of the
untrammeled reason, the righteousness of the separation at the bar of History,
it satisfied the reason of man by adding, "In proof of this let facts be
submitted to a candid world."Nay, it recognized that even above the
conscience of mankind there was the "Ruler of Nations", by Whom all acts would
be finally and infalliby, judged, and therefore the great Declaration concluded
by solemnly "appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude of
our intentions."</p>

<p>Such was the spirit, such the purpose, such the crowning glory of the noblest
State paper ever drafted by the hand of man or proclaimed by any people.It
proclaimed a new principle in the history of human affairs, that not by armies
and navies alone, nor by the power of economic resources, but by the standards
of eternal justice should a nation in the fear of God determine its action.In
like spirit was the parting precept of the Father of his Country, the "counsels
of an old and affectionate friend," voiced in that immortal farewell message,
which was his benediction to the people whom he loved so well:-</p>

<p>"Observe good faith and justice towards all nations.Cultivate peace and
harmony with all.Religion and morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be
that good policy does not equally enjoin it?It will be worthy of a free,
enlightened, and at no distant period, a great nation to give to mankind the
maganimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted
justice and benevolence."</p>

<p>With this spirit we need not fear to face the future.No problem to confront
us will prove too great for our solution, and no work too great for our
achievement.To faintly grasp the future of this country is to bewilder and
exhaust the imagination.The past is but the "happy prologue to the swelling
act of an imperial theme."Today as never before we face the world as a united
country.If wounds there have been, they are healed; if causes for quarrel, it
has gone.East and west, from the Father of Waters, north and south of Mason
and Dixon's Line, we are one today, my fellow countrymen, one, in the proud
possession of the glorious past, one, in a resolute purpose to meet the duties
of the hour, and one, in an abiding faith in the future of our beloved country. 
Never before did her flag float as a symbol of possession over so vast a
dominion.Not only from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf, and from the Atlantic to
the Pacific, but in those islands of the sea, where the Caribbean breaks, and
in that farther archipelago, laved by the China Sea, the Star-Spangled Banner
floats today in proudest triumph.Our boast is that of the mother empire, of
whose teeming womb we are born that night no longer falls upon our possession,
for when these joyous festivities shall have ended and they shall fade from
yonder lagoon, and when the moon shall silver with its mellow glory these noble
temples of art and industry, the sun will be flooding the harbor of Manila, and
illumining that glorious flag, under which Dewey and his heroes defended this
country's honor.For one land, one people, one flag, and one destiny, let us
reverently thank the God of our fathers.May the glory of the Republic be as
lasting as the day, which shines upon her flag, and her beneficent influence
upon future generations as ceaseless as the majestic flow of the Mississippi to
the sea!</p>

<p>When the early afternoon papers reached the grounds bearing the news of the destruction of Spanish Admiral Cervera's fleet and of General Shafter's
ultimatum to the Spanish army in Santiago, bedlam broke loose and tremendous
enthusiasm found expression in cheer after cheer.The managers of the
Exposition who had labored in hopes that the war might cease and that liberal patronage might thereby be assured, now for the first time felt confident of ultimate success, and the day was one of congratulations and good will. Elaborate fireworks closed the celebration, one of the set pieces of the display representing the bombardment of Cervera's fleet, creating the wildest enthusiasm.At 11 o'clock P.M. a grand colored fire illumination of the entire Midway completed the demonstration, and thus one of the great days of the Exposition ended.</p>

<p>MASSACHUSETTS DAY.</p>

<p>July 11, 1898.</p>

<p>The legislature of the state of Massachusetts having provided for a formal
representation at the Exposition, the state officials selected this day for
their visit.At the head of the delegation was Lieut. Gov. W. Murray Crane and
staff.Besides the governor, most of the state officers and numerous members
of the assembly were present.The exercises were held in the Auditorium at 11
o'clock A.M.Governor Holcomb and staff and State Adjutant General Barry,
Chancellor George E. McLean of the University of Nebraska, Manager Rosewater,
and other Nebraskans assisted in the entertainment of the distinguished guests. 
Mrs. Clement Chase, chairman of the bureau of entertainment, and other members
of that bureau were present.After music, Governor Hale was introduced and
heartily welcomed the visitors from the Old Bay State.</p>

<p>Lieut. Gov. W. Murray Crane responded in a brief but appropriate address. 
President Gurdon W. Wattles delivered an address of welcome in which he
referred to the fact that at one time the boundaries of Massachusetts extended
westward to the westward to the western line of the dominion of the nation, and
said that although these boundaries no longer reached to the eastern bounds of
our state, yet the influence of the New England stock from which many of the
residents of the west descended, the ties of consanguinity which bound the west
to the east made the representatives of Massachusetts as welcome as though we
were a part of the Old Bay State itself.</p>

<p>Hon. George E. Smith, president of the senate of Massachusetts, delivered a
most polished address, after which Mrs. G.W. Johnston sang in a most pleasing
manner and was warmly applauded.</p>

<p>Hon. John L. Bates, speaker of the house of representatives of the
Massachusetts legislature was the next speaker.He said that the delegates
from Massachusetts brought the hearty good will of the people of that state and
congratulations on the great Exposition and on the boundless possibilities of
the great country represented by that enterprise.</p>

<p>Chancellor George E. McLean of the Nebraska University then delivered an
address, after which more music was rendered, and the meeting was adjourned to
luncheon served in the Markel Cafe.At this luncheon eloquent toasts were
responded to by W.H. Alexander and W.G. Whitmore, natives of Massachusetts now
residing in Nebraska.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, January 12th, the Massachusetts delegation was tendered a
reception by President Wattles and Mrs. Wattles at their home on Thirty-seventh
street.The wide porch and grounds about their residence were decorated and
illuminated for the occasion.Many of the prominent society people of Omaha
met the Massachusetts visitors, and the function was pronounced one of the most
elaborate and successful of any of the many private receptions given during the
entire Exposition.</p>

<p>CHILDREN'S DAY.</p>

<p>July 14, 1898.</p>

<p>Children celebrated the dedication of the Boys' and Girls' Building.Early in
the construction period of the Exposition, the school children of Nebraska and
Iowa decided to raise by small donations the money for a Boys' and Girls'
Building, to be erected on the Exposition Grounds.This building was located
in the northeast corner of the Grand Court, and though not as large as the
other buildings on this court, it was well adapted for the uses for which it
was erected, the entertainment of the children.The building was a source of
great interest to the thousands of school children who had contributed their
dimes toward its cost and as the admission on this dedication day had been
reduced to $.15 for children, great throngs of little folks were gathered early
to participate in the celebration and view the sights of the Exposition.</p>

<p>The exercises in the building were simple, consisting of a few short speeches
and some music, closing with the singing of the Star Spangled Banner, after
which all formalities were laid aside and the little ones enjoyed themselves in
all parts of the Exposition grounds.The day was closed with the usual concert
in the evening, which was largely attended.</p>

</div>
<div class="chapter doublespace ">

<p>MILITARY DAY.</p>

<p>July 16, 1898.</p>

<p>The Third Regiment of Nebraska had been recruited by Colonel Wm. J. Bryan and
were about to leave the state for service in the Cuban War.They were in camp
at old Fort Omaha and had accepted the invitation of the exposition officials
to attend the exposition in a body before leaving the state.Great
preparations for their comfort had been made by the Woman's Bureau of
Entertainment and many assistants who had volunteered to serve in distributing
the refreshments to the 1500 soldiers who were expected to participate in the
demonstration.At 10 o'clock A.M. the Regiment entered the exposition grounds
at the north gate and were received by General Manager Clarkson with the Pawnee
City Band, and marched down the West Midway over the north viaduct into the
Grand Plaza and from there to the Nebraska Building, and then countermarched
back to the Plaza and over the viaduct to the Grand Court.</p>

<p>Governor Holcomb and staff on horse back, with Colonel Bryan and his aides
preceded the marching troopers, and their bright uniforms contrasting with the
beautiful white of the buildings made a scene long to be remembered by those
who witnessed it.Many fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters,wives and
sweethearts of these volunteers were gathered on the grounds to see and perhaps
embrace their loved ones for the last time.Many bands of music and waving
flags lent enchantment to the scene.At 11 o'clock the troopers gathered in
the Auditorium and with their friends and visitors completely filled the great
building.The public was excluded until the soldiers were seated, and there
was not sufficient room for all who sought admittance.</p>

<p>On the stage were seated Governor Holcomb of Nebraska, Governor Leedy of
Kansas, Colonel William J. Bryan, General Barry, Adjutant General of Nebraska,
General Manager T.S. Clarkson, President Wattles and numerous other exposition
officials.After several selections by the Pawnee City Band, President Wattles
introduced general Manger Clarkson, who delivered an address of welcome to the
soldiers.He bade them Godspeed in the performance of their patriotic duties. 
He paid an eloquent tribute to the men who risked their lives for their
country's honor. His address was often interrupted by cheers and at its' close the Third Regiment Band increased the enthusiasm by playing "The Battle Cry of Freedom."</p>

<p>Governor J.W. Leedy of Kansas then spoke briefly, after which then was more music and then Hon. G.M. Hitchcock was introduced and presented the regiment with a set of silk guidons, two for each of the three battalions.These were received by Colonel Bryan, who expressed feelingly the thanks of his regiment for this and other manifestations of good will which had been showered upon them on every hand. At the close of his address there was more music by the band, after which Governor Holcomb was introduced and delivered the formal farewell of the state to its volunteers.His address brought tears to many eyes as he assured the boys that after they had gone to the front they would be remembered and honored and their achievements would be the pride of the great commonwealth. At the close of Governor Holcomb's address, it was announced that the Woman's Bureau of Entertainment would serve dinner to the soldiers in their seats in the Auditorium. The women who had volunteered to perform this task and had secured the food for the feast were assigned as follows:</p>

<p>Third Regiment Band - Mrs. Charles Shiverick, assisted by Mrs. J.E. Baum, Mrs. John Wilbur, The Misses Adeline Nash, Edna Cowin, Anna Crary, Ethel Morse, Anna Shiverick, and Miss Outcalt of Lincoln.</p>

<p>MINNESOTA DEDICATION DAY.</p>

<p>July 20, 1898.</p>

<p>The Minnesota building, erected by private subscriptions and donations by the
citizens of Minnesota, was unique and unlike any other building on the
Exposition Grounds.It was typical of life in the pine forests of the state it
represented, being constructed entirely of pine logs, hewn and morticed in an
artistic and substantial manner.The building was 70 ft. long, 60 ft. wide and
two stories high.There were two balconies one at each story, 20 feet wide,
with railings made of poles surrounding them.All the materials used in the
construction were shipped form Minnesota and illustrated products of that
state.The rooms were commodious and filled with easy chairs; the walls
decorated with many pictures and heads of animals of the early pioneer life of
the state.</p>

<p>Many distinguished residents of Minnesota came on the two special trains to
celebrate the dedication of Minnesota's building and to see the exposition. 
Governor Clough and staff, the members of the Minnesota Commission, several of
the state officers and members of the legislature, were among the visitors. 
The dedication exercises were held at the building at 10:30 A.M., J. Newton
Ninde, chairman of the Building Committee, presiding, who first introduced
Governor Silas A. Holcomb, of Nebraska, who welcomed the Governor of Minnesota
and other distinguished guests.John L. Gibbs, President of the Minnesota
Commission, and Lieut. Gov. of Minnesota, responded in a happy manner, after
which Governor Clough was introduced and formally accepted the building and in
turn delivered it to the Exposition officials.President Wattles of the
Exposition accepted it for the management and after his address and music by
the band,Honorable W.H. Eustis of Minnesota delivered the closing address.The
exercises closed with more music.</p>

<p>A public reception was tendered Governor Clough and his party after the
exercises of the day in the parlors of the Minnesota Building.</p>

<p>INDIAN DAY.</p>

<p>August 4, 1898.</p>

<p>Inaugurating the Features of the Great Indian
Congress.</p>

<p>Early in the history of the Exposition it was proposed by President Wattles
that an Indian Congress of the principal tribes of North American Indians
should be one of the distinctive features of the exposition.That as all of
the Transmississippi territory had, but a comparatively few years past, been
occupied by these Indian tribes, and that as they were fast disappearing and
their modes of life and customs were gradually changing with the onward march
of civilization, it would perhaps be the last time that the primitive life of
these tribes could ever be successfully illustrated.As many eastern people
had never seen Indians in their semi-savage state, it was argued that this
Indian Congress would be a great drawing feature that would bring many eastern
people to visit the Exposition.</p>

<p>A bill was introduced in Congress authorizing the assemblage of these Indian
tribes and providing an appropriation of $40,000 to defray the expenses.Much
delay was experienced in the passage of this measure and finally Manager
Rosewater was prevailed upon to go to Washington and lend his efforts to those
of Congressman Mercer and Senators Allen and Thurston in securing the desired
legislation.When the bill was finally passed it was too late to assemble the
Indians for the opening of the exposition and before the encampment was
complete on the exposition grounds the first of August had passed.On the day
set for the grand parade of Indian tribes which should mark the opening of the
Indian Congress, there was encamped on the north tract of the exposition
grounds a goodly number of the following tribes:</p>

<p>Chippewas, Rosebud, Lower Brule, Cheyennes, Sisertons, Flandreau, Standing
Rock, Crow, Creek, Sioux, Sacs, Foxes, Assiniboines, Omahas, Winnebagos,
Blackfeet, Arapahoes, Jicarilla, Apaches, Nez Perces, Comanches, Wichitas,
Bannocks, Pueblos, Osages, Iroquois and Poncas.The Indians were in charge of
Captain Mercer.The morning was spent in arranging their camps and in raising
the flag, which was accompanied with much ceremony and wild cheering.In the
afternoon the parade was formed and marched through the Midway over the North
Viaduct and down the Bluff Tract to the Horticultural Building, countermarching
back to the Grand Plaza.Several bands formed a part of the parade and the
Indians were dressed in the fantastic manner indigenous to their respective
tribes.After the parade and a short rest, the afternoon was spent in weird
dances, horse racing and other Indian amusements.The day was a great success
in point of attendance and from this, the opening day of the Indian Congress,
until the close of the exposition, the Indians proved a great attraction.</p>

<p>FLOWER DAY.</p>

<p>Aug. 5, 1898.</p>

<p>For several weeks preparations had been going on for a grand Flower Parade on
the Exposition Grounds.This parade was one of the decided successful features
of the Exposition period.The women of the Bureau of Entertainment under the
supervision and direction of Mrs. H. McCall Travis, assumed full charge of the
decoration of vehicles that were to take part in the parade.The pageant
formed in the afternoon at the Horticulture Building, those participating with

<p>NATIONAL, STATE AND CITY DAYS.</p>

<p>The state buildings on the grounds having been dedicated, it was now decided to
inaugurate numerous special celebrations for states, cities and national
events.All of these special days proved more or less attractive and no doubt
did much to swell the general attendance of the Exposition.Special promotion
agents had extended the invitation of the president of the exposition to
numerous of the larger Transmississippi cities to designate special days which
would be set aside by the exposition management for these cities.The first
celebration in acceptance of this invitation was</p>

<p>KANSAS CITY DAY.</p>

<p>August 6, 1898.</p>

<p>The officials and citizens of Kansas City came in goodly numbers to celebrate
that day.President Wattles and Mayor Frank E. Moores welcomed the visitors as
they gathered in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock A.M. for the ceremonies which had
been arranged for the occasion.Mayor Moores, in his usual felicitous manner,
extended to the visitors the freedom of the city, and presented Acting Mayor
A.D. Burrows with huge golden keys which he explained would admit the visitors
to all the pleasures of our city.Acting Mayor Burrows responded and spoke in
the highest terms of their admiration for the Transmississippi and
International Exposition which he declared was far beyond their most sanguine
expectations.</p>

<p>Ex-Governor Crittenden of Missouri, responded in behalf of the state and after
music by the band, president Wattles formally addressed the visitors.This
concluded the speech-making, after which the distinguished visitors were
escorted to the city by Mayor Moores and the city officials and tendered a
banquet at the Millard Hotel.</p>

<p>OMAHA WORLD-HERALD AND NEBRASKA EDITORS' DAY.</p>

<p>August 24, 1898.</p>

<p>The Omaha World-Herald had requested and been granted a special day in which to
celebrate the achievements of this progressive daily newspaper.The occasion
of the celebration was the 13th anniversary of the founding of the Evening
World, which grew to be the World-Herald.The day was the same as that set
aside as Nebraska Editors' Day and the two services were therefore merged two
celebrations were therefore merged.The exercises on the grounds were a
luncheon served at the Markel Cafe at the expense of the editor of the
World-Herald.G.M. Hitchcock, proprietor of that paper, presided.After
luncheon the speech-making was started by Mr. Hitchcock, who spoke of the many
pleasures the Exposition afforded his friends, and of the many trials and great
effort by which this grand spectacle had been made possible.He then
introduced President Wattles, who spoke briefly of the history and progress of
the exposition and in closing, referred to the grand Peace Jubilee which had
been planned for the month of October.He referred to the fact that Captain
Jones of the 22nd Infantry was present, carrying a Spanish bullet in his leg. 
His reference to Captain Jones was the occasion of great cheering, which called
for a short acknowledgment from the Captain.Dr. George L. Miller, founder of
the Omaha World-Herald, responded to the toast "Seed Time and Harvest of
Newspaperdom".He spoke in his usual felicitous manner and elicited much
laughter and applause.</p>

<p>W.S. Day, of the Aurora Register, responded to the toast."Nebraska, She Leads
Them All".He spoke in part as follows:</p>

<p>In some respects I am unfitted by nature to make response to the toast
proposed, being of an argumentative disposition and accustomed to reach
conclusions only by exhaustive and exhausting discussion.A question with only
one side to it and not end at all, is a very difficult one for me to handle. 
When a boy I remember reflecting on the awful consequences of a supposed
encounter between an irresistible force and an immovable body, but they are
likely to prove mild in comparison with the result when an interminable talker
comes into perihelion with an inexhaustible subject.</p>

<p>That Nebraska leads them all is a self-evident proposition.Who would produce
statistics to demonstrate that the sun shines or the wind blows.(Especially
would it resemble the carrying of coals to Newcastle to attempt to prove by
figures or diagrams that the wind blows in Nebraska.)The people of this state
have acquired a reputation of being a little extravagant and given to
exaggeration when speaking of its advantages.I shall, therefore, weigh well
my words and be ultra conservative in every statement made, preferring only the
modest claim that Nebraska has the richest soil, the purest air, the best water
and as manly men and womanly women as can be found on this earth.</p>

<p>One has but to breathe the lifeless air of the lower altitudes; note the
stunted products of the red and yellow putty called farm land throughout the
east and south; attempt to swallow the lukewarm solution of clay which hundreds
of thousands of good people must use as a beverage, to be keenly sensible of
some of the every day, yet priceless blessings in which Nebraska leads them
all.No person who has sweltered through the long night and until 4 o'clock in
the morning for a refreshing breath, or who has felt a touch of malaria in his
system, would be willing to exchange our climate for all the big red apples of
the universe.</p>

<p>I am of the west, western.I have lived here for more than a quarter century
and have passed from boyhood to manhood in a homestead country.I can remember
breaking sod day after day when the highest object in sight was the ears of my
taller horse.</p>

<p>I have witnessed the development of our state form a barren, treeless plain to
one of the most fertile and beautiful countries ever sung by poets or prosed
over by historians.The labor of one generation of men has effected this
transformation, and next to the welfare of my family I have no stronger wish
than seeing Nebraska owned, free and clear of encumbrance, by the people who
have sacrificed so much to make what it is.</p>

<span class="lg poem">

<span class="l">Long ago in the days of "hoppers",</span>
<span class="l">When real estate agents dealt in whoppers,</span>
<span class="l">House of sod with roof poles limber;</span>
<span class="l">Buffalo Grass and cottonwood timber</span>
<span class="l">People poor - with hearts of pity;</span>
<span class="l">Each incipient town a city;</span>
<span class="l">Hedge rows broke, but roads across 'em</span>
<span class="l">Folks that let nobody boss 'em;</span>
<span class="l">That's the West as I first knew it.</span></span>

<p>The settlers of those days may have had to live largely on "bread and with it",
but no heroes have greater claims on the world's history than the pioneers of
Nebraska.Earnest and indomitable, hard-working and self-denying, they labored
to make homes for their children, and they bore with fortitude - nay,
unexampled good humor - all the misfortunes of frontier life.</p>

<p>One day in August, a forlorn, disheartened looking team, drawing a rickety
wagon, passed through our "city", bearing a western family back east for a
winter's visit to the "wife's folks."As they drove by a crowd of young
fellows gathered in front of the harness shop and it became apparent from the
looks and gestures of the spectators that they were poking fun at his rig. 
Quick as a flash the homesteader gave to his willing team the signal to stop
and leveling his long forefinger at the boys, shouted earnestly:"Look here,
strangers, I ain't so darned poor as you think I am.One of these horses isn't
mine."</p>

<p>Such citizenship is one of the resources of Nebraska.The best harvest of
which any land can boast is brave and worthy men and women.The best heritage
we can leave our children is an ancestry that merits their emulation.These
things have left their impress upon Nebraska.Springing from such stock,
surrounded by such environments, who wonders that everything here is done on a
large scale.That our stock fields are so extensive that we are spoken of as
the "fodder land "; that we could furnish a necklace of corn cribs to encircle
almost any territory desired; that our commerce, both internal and external,
exceeds that of any other commonwealth of equal age, and that in the late
Spanish skirmish we made a record that proves us worthy sons of the brave sires
who in the days of rebellion from a population of 30,000 -possibly 7,500
families- sent 3,307 officers and men to fight for freedom.</p>

<p>To conclude, Nebraska is noted for her peculiarities, her possibilities and her
productions.The fame of our pure air, Poland China pigs and pop-pop-popular
government has gone abroad in the land.Who has not heard of our bright women,
brainy men, and Bry-an.Where can you find the equal of our cattle, corn or
country newspapers?Our crops are world-beaters; our Exposition beats the
World's Fair; and our World-Herald can't be beat.</p>

<p>The day has come when we can attune our voices not only to the melody of
pioneer days.</p>

<span class="lg song">
<span class="l">"A home, a home,</span>
<span class="l">Where the deer and antelope play;</span>
<span class="l">Where seldom is heard</span>
<span class="l">A discouraging word</span>
<span class="l">And the sky is not clouded all day".</span></span>

<p>But remembering the achievements of the years gone by, can catch the more
majestic strain:</p>

<span class="lg song">
<span class="l">"From Atlantic to Rocky Sierras,</span>
<span class="l">No people more loyal or true,</span>
<span class="l">Nebraska, the gem of the prairies,</span>
<span class="l">The best 'neath the red, white and blue."</span></span>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>G.W. Hurlbut, of the Aurora Sun, responded to the toast "A Country Yokel". W.J. Waite, of the Exeter Enterprise, responded to the toast, "The Late Unpleasantness".</p>

<p>W.T. Howard, of the Schuyler Sun, responded to the toast, "The Exposition as an Educator."He closed his eloquent address with the following words:"The
memory of the Transmississippi Exposition will ever remain an enduring monument to western energy and civilization and of the minds who conceived and carried the project to practical results."</p>

<p>The program closed with the toast "The Country Press:Its Might and Its
Mercy:"Responded to by Edgar Howard, of the Papillion Times.</p>

<p>after which an address was delivered by President Wattles, as follows:</p>

<p>"At the dedication of the Kansas Building on these grounds, it was my pleasure to speak briefly of the material resources, wealth and magnificent proportions and fertility of the state.I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without reviewing those historic events which for many years made Kansas the battle-ground of public opinion, and which finally culminated in the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the development of an independent progressive civilization.
During the possession of Spain and France of the vast territory which now
constitutes most of the Trans-Mississippi country, very little was known of the
country, then supposed to be a wilderness, only habitable by savage tribes.It
is said that Coronado was the first white man to explore the state.He was in
search of rich provinces, rumored to abound in magnificent cities, with untold
wealth.For nearly three hundred years after his unsuccessful search, history
is silent.In 1820 Major Long explored a part of the state and described its
prairies as "billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shade and sunshine".He
found in the western part of the state buffalo, elk and deer sufficient to feed
all the savages in the United States for a century to come.But it was not
until 1853 that settlers in any large numbers came to make their home in this
then unorganized territory.By the Kansas and Nebraska Bill, which became a
law in 1854, breaking down the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Kansas became the
theatre on which was to be enacted the first scene in the great drama of the
Civil War.The contest for supremacy between the slaveholders and the
abolitionist began when the cavalier of the south and the Puritan of the north,
with conflicting ideas in morality, religion and politics, met to contest for
supremacy.For many years the enthusiasts of both sides of the great question
of slavery emigrated from all parts of the north and south to this new
territory and engaged in contention for principles, rather than in the work of
developing the resources of the state.The contests at the poles, at public
meetings, and in legislative bodies frequently culminated in scenes of blood
and carnage which excited the passions of both sections represented.John
Brown was a fanatic only a few degrees more enthusiastic than many others who
went from the north and east to prevent the territory form declaring for
slavery.The occupation of these early settlers was exciting but unprofitable. 
The framing of constitutions, the election of legislatures and the frequent
personal contests finally culminated in the triumph of the Free State Party and
the framing of a state constitution, which was ratified by the people in 1859
and finally approved by Congress in 1861, when the state was admitted to the
Union.</p>

<p>In seven years Kansas had had seven territorial governors, had framed four
state constitutions and had attracted the attention of the world to the great
issue of human slavery.The remaining scenes in the drama were transferred to
the halls of Congress, to the political organizations of the nation and finally
to the battle fields of the civil war, and the people of Kansas, after years of
agitation and excitement, settled down to the more serious business of
providing homes and bread for a rapidly increasing population, but their
troubles were not to end.1860 will forever be remembered as the year of
drouth and famine.The records show that from June 1859 to November 1860 there
was not a shower of rain at any time sufficient to wet the earth two inches in
depth.Throughout the entire state and many other states of the south the
blasting blight of famine and want was felt.The word went out throughout the
land that men and women were starving and would suffer from cold and hunger
without the aid of other states.The great heart of the nation was aroused by
these appeals, and from every quarter of the country came the response in aid
of suffering humanity.The limited means of transportation were taxed to their
utmost to carry the gifts of the nation to the inhabitants of a suffering
state.One third of the population of the state returned to eastern friends
and homes,and for many years the evil effects and exaggerated reports of this
great drouth retarded the growth of this rich state.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this great calamity those pioneers who remained on their farms
were richly rewarded by abundant crops and a period of prosperity which enabled
them to repay their debt to the nation by furnishing more troops in proportion
to population for the suppression of the rebellion than any other state in the
union.</p>

<p>The conflicting elements of the early pioneers became united by the marriage of
their sons and daughters.The question of slavery ceased to be an issue, and
its final solution by the Emancipation Proclamation cemented all conflicting
elements,leaving only the enthusiasm the originality and the independence of
thought and action which at all times has characterized the inhabitants of this
state.</p>

<p>Great men in state and national affairs, willing and able to assert and
maintain original and progressive principles in philosophy, morals and
politics, stand out in the history of the nation, forever placing Kansas in the
front rank of reform.Kansas was one of the first states to declare for
prohibition, to grant the mothers and sisters rights of property and franchise,
to protest against the combinations of capital and greed of corporations.The
names of Lane, Plum and Ingalls have honored the state in the halls of
Congress, while Glick, Martin and Leedy are known throughout the land as men of
original ideas with the courage to enforce their convictions.Mrs. Lease and
Jerry Simpson are types of the original, aggressive and progressive elements
which abound in this state.We may denounce their theories, but we must admit
their sincerity.</p>

<p>With such a population, supplemented with a land of sunshine and rich soil
unsurpassed in fertility by any other state in the Union, Kansas will always be
found in the front rank in all progressive enterprises among the people of the
west.The state is always represented at conventions for the promotion of
western interests.At this Exposition which illustrates in such magnificence
the wealth, progress and prosperity of the great west, Kansas takes her place
with no apologies, from beets in greater quantities than can be extracted from
the cane which grows in Hawaii and Cuba.Whether the energies of our people
should be diverted to the conquest of foreign, uncivilized subjects, or be
expended in developing and building up the untold resources of our present
domain, is a question worthy of the most serious consideration.</p>

<p>This occasion is neither proper nor opportune for the discussion of serious
subjects of policy or politics.I congratulate the people of Kansas on the
magnificent opportunities this state offers to home seekers and investors.I
congratulate the state on the enterprise and energy of its citizens, displayed
in the beautiful building and splendid exhibit at this Exposition.I
congratulate the governor of the state, the commissioners and all of its
citizens here today on the success of Kansas Day, and wish for them one and all
such prosperity as the fortitude of their pioneers and the enthusiasm and
enterprise of their citizens deserve.</p>

<p>MONTANA DEDICATION DAY.</p>

<p>June 29, 1898.</p>

<p>The location of the Montana building gave it prominence, being on the main
avenue leading south from the esplanade, and near the entrance to the Bluff
Tract from Sherman Avenue.The building was well arranged, and under the able
supervision of Mr. W.H. Sutherlin, Exposition vice-president for Montana.The
Montana building and exhibit, both of which reflected great credit on the
state, were made possible by the liberal donation of Mr. Marcus Dailey, who
pledged the delegation that visited Montana to promote the exposition in the
winter of 1897, a donation of $15,000; the legislature afterwards appropriated
a like amount, and the exhibits from that state and the building erected by the
Commission were placed in charge of vice-president Sutherlin.</p>

<p>The exercises dedicating the building to the uses for which it had been
erected, were held at 4 o'clock P.M., and while simple, were impressive.The
program consisted of a short address by Vice-president Sutherlin, several
musical selections, and an address by President Gurdon W. Wattles, and were
concluded by a luncheon served by the Montana Commission.</p>

<p>The celebration of Iowa Day had been advertised throughout the state of Iowa, and special trains came from all parts of that state loaded with enthusiastic visitors. Excursion rates had been made by all the railroads in Iowa and the effect of this was early seen in the large crowds which they brought to the Exposition gates.The program celebrating this day was one of unusual interest. It was held in the Auditorium at 2:30 P.M.The Auditorium was filled to overflowing when the exercises were commenced by an organ voluntary, introducing the following program:</p>

<p>Address, Governor Leslie M. Shaw.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens and Friends of Iowa:</p>

<p>"Not many generations ago, in the place where you now sit, encircled by all
that exalts and embellishes civilized life, the rank thistle nodded in the
breeze, and the wild fox digged his hole unscared."So said Charles Sprague
three-quarters of a century ago, and the utterance is as true when applied to the land of the Omahas as to the land of the Wampanoags.</p>

<p>We meet this day as citizens of Iowa, on the soil of a sister state, for no
idle purpose.The people of Iowa are not idlers, but the day will have been
lost to us and to our children, unless what is here said, and done, and
witnessed, and enjoyed shall bring greater thoughtfulness and increased
earnestness.The half century and two years since the admission of Iowa added
the twenty-ninth star to the flag which has now become the protector of the
world have wrought great changes.Most of the improvements of earth, most of
the progress in the arts and sciences, most of the advance in civilization,
have been wrought within the period of our State history.Time would not
permit, if the inclination were present, to recount the achievements in the
political, industrial, financial, agricultural, mechanical, scientific,
educational, religious or moral world.Suffice it to say that in all of these
Iowa has rendered her full share of service, and has reaped her full measure of
blessing.We can well afford to leave to others the study of the past.Let it
be ours manfully to face the future, now more than ever big with possibilities,
and with careful glance ahead improve the present.</p>

<p>In all the grand exhibit of this remarkable Exposition there is not found that
for which our State has greatest reason to rejoice.The product of the farm,
of the orchard, of the garden, of the herd, of the dairy, of the factory, of
the mine are here in great quantity and of superb quality.Truly Iowa is great
in territory, great in resources, great in product, but she is greatest of all
in her children.There is presented to my eye from the platform that which is
infinitely more valuable than all herds and all harvests.I see scattered
through this audience many of the youth of Iowa.They are from the city, from
the town, from the hamlet, and from the Iowa farm.They are representatives of
an aggregate of seven hundred thousand of school age, and of an equal number
who have just passed from educational tuition to face the activities, the
anxieties, and the achievements of manhood and womanhood.These all belong to
a generation which will surely be heard from.Their fathers and mothers have
been industrious, have been ambitious, have been hopeful, and have been
successful.A generation thus circumstanced is always potential.Dr. Strong
tells of a township in the western reserve which was settled with an energetic,
liberty-loving, God-fearing, educationally-inclined people, and which in a
limited period furnished many members of the State Legislature.From that
community of only a few hundred inhabitants men went forth to college
professorships east and west, to the supreme bench of the State, and to the
United States Congress.Northhampton, Mass., has among its native and resident
population over four hundred graduates form colleges and other educational
institutions; it has furnished the world with one hundred and fourteen
ministers, eighty-four ministers' wives, ten missionaries, twenty-five judges,
one hundred and two lawyers, ninety-five physicians, seven college presidents,
thirty professors, sixty-four other educators, twenty-four editors, six
historians, twenty-four authors, two governors, and thirty other State
officers, twenty-five members of the State General Court, as the Legislature is
styled, two generals, six colonels, thirteen other army officers, thirty-eight
officers of the United States, among them a Secretary of the Navy, two Foreign
Ministers, a Treasurer of the United States, five Senators of the United
States, eight Members of Congress and one President.If a territory six miles
square, under favorable conditions can make such a record, what may we not
hopefully expect from a territory containing fifty-five thousand square miles,
all of it similarly peopled, and with conditions more favorable than
Massachusetts ever enjoyed or Ohio ever possessed.</p>

<p>"Know thyself", said the Greek philosopher."Know thine opportunity" has
become a companion and equally important maxim.</p>

<p>When you go home tonight tell the children that the world is big and constantly expanding; that this day's experience has broadened your vision; that life has become more real and hope more ardent; and that both you and the world, and especially the States expect something of them. Wake the boy in the night, break in upon his dreams with stories of hopeful possibilities; watch the fire kindle in his eye; let him dream again of greater things, of broader expanses, of higher altitudes, of nobles achievements. Neglect neigher seed time nor harvest; match the growing and maturing crops; succor and protect both flocks and herd; zealously guard the interests of the shop and the store and the office; but above all, look well to the youth of Iowa, and to all things that shall conserve the generation whose footsteps crowd the threshold of the world's activities.</p>

<p>PRESIDENT WATTLE'S WELCOME.</p>

<p>When I received the invitation from the Iowa Commission to make an address on
this occasion, I at once realized my inability within the limited time at my
disposal to express in a fitting manner, even my own sentiments regarding a
state among whose inhabitants twenty-five years of my life had been spent, of a
state in whose public schools and colleges I received my education and to whose
magnificent advantages and opportunities I am indebted for whatever business
success I may have attained.With apologies for apparent disloyalty to my
adopted state of Nebraska, I say without fear of successful contradiction that
Iowa is the best agricultural state in the Union.There is a smaller
percentage of untillable land in this state than is found any other equal body
of land in the world.The state has less illiteracy, more school houses and
churches and a less number of criminals in proportion to population than any
other state in the Union.It has a better code of laws, a more industrious,
frugal and prosperous population; its wealth is more evenly distributed among
its inhabitants, its climate is more healthy and its people more contented and
happy than the average state of this country or in any other state or territory
of like extent in any other country in the world.</p>

<p>These may seem extravagant statements, but they are subject to verification by
facts and figures. The question may be asked, why should this be true.The
answer is plain and in perfect accord with the philosophy and history of all
past ages. Agriculture is the source of all wealth, it breeds contentment,
virtue and happiness." From the farms comes not only the bread but the virtue of this nation." The principal avocation of the inhabitants of Iowa is farming. There are no large metropolitan cities to corrupt the morals and
excite the greed of its inhabitants, there are no mines of gold and silver to attract and disappoint its people. It is true that a large area of the state is underlaid with rich deposits of coal, but beyond this its mineral wealth is confined to small districts where lead and zinc are found.The state lies within that temperate belt of latitude along which the progress, intelligence, wealth and energy of the world are most abundantly found. Neither the long hot summers of the southern climes nor the cold rigorous winters of the northern states enervates its inhabitants. The soil is rich and productive, cereals and fruits mature alike in abundance. All of the elements that produce happiness, contentment and prosperity combine and conspire to make its inhabitants intelligent, prosperous and contented.</p>

<p>But with all its natural advantages, a large majority of its inhabitants have
earned for themselves from its rich resources the competency they now enjoy. 
It is truly said "There is no excellence without labor," and but for the labor,
hardships and privations of the early settlers of this great commonwealth, I
doubt if they or their descendants would to-day occupy the high places in the
business world which they have attained.The early pioneers were all poor and
but few of the later settlers had more than a few dollars with which to begin
life.The privations of those who first entered the lands in the center of the
state purchased of the Black Hawk Indians were sufficient to develop the energy
and inspire that determined effort which always brings success.In the fifties
when no railroad had penetrated the state when wheat was hauled two hundred
miles by wagon and sold at forty cents per bushel,when farm produce for want of
a market was worthless, when the fear of the Indian massacre and the ever
present dread of sickness and want on the frontier far away from medical or
neighborly aid, their trials were supreme.Surrounded with perplexities and
almost over-come by obstacles which to the present generation would seem
insurmountable, with no roads and no bridges, in this solitude and loneliness
and amid the awful stillness which pervades a new land like this, these
pioneers learned lessons of frugality, economy and self reliance which insured
for them and their descendants success and prosperity, and an appreciation of
the comforts and conveniences which came later with advanced civilization. 
Later immigrants who came into the state with such a flood during the '60's
immediately after the great Rebellion suffered privations little less severe
than those endured by the earlier pioneers.</p>

<p>As a boy whose earlier years had been spent in populous communities, I well
remember the solitude of those prairies extending as far as the eye could reach
with no sign of life with their billows of grass rolling like the great waves
of the sea.I can picture in memory the illumination of the heavens in autumn
when great prairie fires swept with terrible conflagration the broad expanse of
unoccupied lands and lighted the skies with firery tongues which seemed to
portend destruction of the settlements they surround.In many instances in
these early days these prairie fires swept with terrible velocity through
fields of ripening corn and laid waste the crops and buildings and sometimes
consumed the entire possessions of the hapless settler who was exposed to their
grand and destructive holocaust.I can well remember when these prairies were
thought to be worthless, when the only settlements were along the wooded steams
and when it was said that man could not live through the rigorous storms that
blew with such velocity with nothing to break their force, across these plains
in winter, and when the first man ventured out from the shelter of the woods to
make his home on the open prairie he was thought to be insane.How glad the
hearts of those settlers to hear the first screech of the locomotive, and the
sound of the approach of the first railway train.Each additional evidence of
civilization was appreciated beyond the power of the imagination of those who
have never known want of the present advantages at our doors.</p>

<p>It was this school in these early days which reared within the state of Iowa a
self reliant, industrious and frugal population, which has given caste to all
subsequent settlement.These early settlers and their descendants own their
homes to-day and are surrounded by many of the comforts and conveniences of
life.They are happy in the comparison of their changed conditions.They have
won for themselves by the individual efforts the reward which follows honest
toil.I have known hundreds, yes, thousands of the present prosperous heads of
families in Iowa who came to the state in poverty, and who today are free from
debt and own their rich, well stocked and productive farms.Who can wonder
that such a population surrounded as they are with all the conveniences of
civilization should be intelligent, prosperous and happy.</p>

<p>Ever ready to promote the interests of their state by advertising its
resources, Iowa was the first through her legislature to approve of this
Exposition, and the first state in the Union to make an appropriation for a
state exhibit here.She stands among the first in the beauty and convenience
of their building and the variety and extent of her exhibit.It is with pride
and pleasure that I welcome her citizens here today.This Exposition is the
crowning achievement of the people of the west, it marks an epoch in the
history of their progress, it serves notice to all the world that the west is
no longer lacking in population, wealth and enterprise, and it reveals a vision
of future development which will eclipse its phenomenal past.</p>

<p>When we consider the wonderful strides that have been made in all of the states
and territories west of the Mississippi River during the short space of half a
century, when we compute the wealth that has been accumulated, when we realize
that 80,000 miles of railroad have been constructed, great cities built and a
commerce double that of Spain and Portugal established, when we know and
realize that in no other part of the world such opportunities for the investor
and home seeker are offered as can be found within this territory, we can
picture in our imagination its future greatness and power.When I think of the
wonderful changes that have been wrought within the state of Iowa within the
past thirty years, how the Red Men have been driven from their grounds to make
room for the rich farms and cities which now support a population of more than
2,000,000 people, of how schools and colleges have been built, public
institutions for the promotion of education, morality, Christianity and good
government established, and how out of the chaos and the stillness of the
wilderness such a commonwealth has grown within the memory of even the young
men of this generation.I almost believe it must be the dawn of the millennium
when happiness, prosperity and contentment such as the world has never known is
to permeate the lives of all men.When I stand and view the magnificence and
wealth of the west displayed at this Exposition, I almost feel like the rural
farmer, who on entering these grounds a short time ago exclaimed, "If heaven is
only as beautiful, I shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>To all the beauties of these grounds and the pleasures to be found in viewing
the wonderful resources displayed in these buildings, I invite the visitors
from Iowa to participate.This Exposition is yours as well as ours, you are
equal partners in the enterprise, and from its success, now happily insured,
you may learn many lessons of value for the future.It not only illustrates
the wealth and progress of a great people, but it points to future
possibilities undreamed of before.To the homeless millions of less favored
climes it is a messenger of promise, to the weary mariner whose fortunes have
been wrecked on the seas of adversity it is a harbinger of hope, it opens new
fields to the investor, inspires the ambition of the genius, incites the
emulation of states and stands the crowning glory in the history of the west.</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF ROBERT C. COUSINS, M.C. AT OMAHA.</p>

<p>The State of Iowa accepts with fraternal gladness the hospitable hand of
greeting extended by Nebraska and our other sister States in this great empire
of the pioneers and salutes with reverent patriotism the deferral government of
the United States.</p>

<p>In the words of that original and poetic genius, "Ironquill," who has voiced so well the thought and feelings of our westland, and who has made the name of
Kansas known forever in the world of letters:</p>

<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">States are not great</span>
<span class="l">Except as man may make them.</span>
<span class="l">Men are not great except they do and dare.</span>
<span class="l"/>
<span class="l">All merit comes from braving the unequal.</span>
<span class="l">All glory comes from daring to begin.</span></span>

<p>I have asked five of the ablest and most noted Americans what they regard as
the chief thing or leading feature of the Trans-Mississippi region and they
have invariably answered, "Its men and women."The other day I met one of the
oldest settlers of eastern Iowa - one of those original, rugged characters
whose wit and wisdom has lightened the settlers' hearts and homes for many a
toilsome year - one of those interesting characters who never bores you and
whom one always likes to meet - a man whose head is silvered and whose
countenance is kind - and I asked him what he regarded as the principal feature
of our Trans-Mississippi country, and he replied: "Well, I'm no scholar, but
I've been round here nigh onto sixty years and I recon 'bout the most important
thing is the folks and the farms."</p>

<p>While you rest here a little while in this splendid auditorium before going to
view the wonders and the beauties of the Exposition (and incidentally the
Midway) I shall speak briefly of the folks and farms of my native state of Iowa
and of this empire of the pioneers.In doing so, I have some hesitation,
realizing as I do that there are doubtless those in this vast audience who were
contemporaries with my grandfathers in the early settlement of Iowa away back
in the thirties, and who are far better qualified to tell the tale of toil and
triumph which is the glory and the honor of our birthland.In such a
discussion, I feel as though I was standing on the bank of a magnificent stream
in the hearing of patriarchs and pilgrims who have traveled from its source.I
can look at its swift flowing current and think of the scenes by which it has
swept in its lonely way form the wilds where it started; I can remember with
you the roaming red man who watched with jealous eye the coming of this
Anglo-Saxon stream of civilization; I can marvel with you at the vastness of
the products of its soil, watered with the tears of happiness and toil; I can
realize with you the ruggedness and patience of its manhood and the strength
and gentleness of its womanhood, but of its landscape farther up, its
tributaries and its cabins, its haunts and huts and wonders, its
picturesqueness of primeval life, the story is far better told by him whose
tired feet have trudged along the way, whose hands have toiled and whose hair
has turned to gray.</p>

<p>Iowa became a separate territory, with the capitol at Burlington, in 1838, and
was admitted into the Union in 1846, and has been in it ever since.It makes
little difference whether it was first settled by the whites at Dubuque for
mining purposes in 1788, or, for trading purposes, at Montrose, in 1799, or
opposite Prairie duChien, in 1804 or 5, in Lee county at Sandusky in 1820, or
on the lower rapids at what is known as Nashville, in 1829; or whether the
first settlements for general purposes were made at Burlington and Davenport in
1832.The main facts is that it was well settled - not by dyspeptic tourists
or by invalids who had come west out of curiosity and New Jersey, nor by
climate seeking dilettante with two servants and one lung - but by the best
bone and sinew of the Middle States, New England and the Old World.I do not
know that there were any dukes or lords or marquises or duchesses, but there
were Dutch and Irish and Scotch and Scotch-Irish and English and Americans and
they had home rule right from the start - at least they had in the first school
which I attended.The men and women who settled the Hawkeye State were not
those who expected to go back "in the fall", or as soon as they could prove up
their claims.They were stayers.They were not men to be discouraged by
winter or by work.They were men who knew that nobody ever amounted to much
unless he had to.Most of them began simply with the capital of honesty, good
health and their inherent qualities of character.They built their cabins in
the clearings and watching the smoke curl up in the great wide sky, felt just
as patriotic for their humble rustic homes as e'er did princes for their
castles or millionaires for mansions grand.</p>

<p>To build a home is a great thing.It doesn't matter so much about the
dimensions."Kings have lived in cottages and pygmies dwelt in palaces," but
the walls of a home always add something to inherent character.In the
formation of character there are always two elements the inherent and the
adventitious - that which we bring with us into the world and that which our
surroundings give us.Somebody said "There is only a small portion of the
earth that produces splendid people."Our pioneers got into a good place. 
They had left doubt sitting on a boulder in the east and packed their things
and started for the west.Rivers had to be forded, trees to be felled; cabins
had to be built - the rifle must be kept loaded - so much the better, there was
self-reliance.Corn and coffee had to be ground, and on the same mill - so
much the better, there was ingenuity.Teeth had to be filled, and there was no
painless dentistry.Disease and injury must be dealt with, and the doctor
fifty miles away.Life must be lightened, lonely hearts must be cheered, and
the old friends and comrades far back in the states or may be away in the
Fatherland, and the cheering letter tarrying with the belated stagecoach hold
fast, thou sturdy denizen and gentle helpmate of the rich and wonderous empire,
infinite goodness guards thee and the fertile fields are ready to reward.</p>

<p>Ah, pampered people of the later generations, when you imagine modern
hardships, think of the courage and the trials and the ingenuity of pioneers
when there were no conveniences but the forest and the axe, the wide rolling
prairie and the ox team, the great blue sky, the unsolved future and the annual
ague.Complain of markets in these modern times and then think of your
grandmother when she was a blooming bride, listening through the toilsome days
and anxious nights for the wagon bringing home the husband from a distant
market with calico and jeans purchased with dressed pork sold a dollar and a
half a hundred, and maybe bringing home a little money, worth far less per yard
than either calico or jeans.Maybe it was all for the best, human character
was being formed for the development of a great and loyal and progressive State
to shine forever among the stars of the Federal Union.</p>

<p>Probably the purest time in the history of government and of man is when they
are painfully intent upon the labor of their development and defense.Most all
greatness and nearly every original idea has come out of some kind of trouble. 
Whoever gets to greatness or success without meeting opposition, goes in an air
castle.Most of the flowers of genius have bloomed from bleeding hearts. 
There never was a strong and handsome face without some little line of care. 
And so every circumstance of those early, toilsome lives, every tedious trail,
every tear, every home whose roof kept out the storm and whose walls contained
their sorrows and their joys; all the gifts of a generous soil in return for
careful cultivation; every irritating inconvenience which finally drove some
questioned mind to ponder out improvements, all such experiences are as certain
in their formation and development of character and mind as are inherent
qualities that accompany the origin and mystery of life.</p>

<p>Somewhere I have seen an etching of a face that was called Experience, and I
have never forgotten it - one never does forget a face that has ideas in it. 
This one was the illustrated history of a life.There was Youth with all its
hope, marked here and there with all the lines of strife and care and victory
which middle life had placed upon it.And there was the mystic touch of later
years, like autumn's pencil work in nature, all shaded with the mellow haze of
time - a kind of soft and silvery veil with which deft nature covers up her
glory - a picture penciled by an artist with an understanding mind, who knew
his subject had thought as he had thought, felt as he had felt, dreamed as he
had dreamed - a kind of picture that one sees so very very seldom, only as
often as one finds genius - the divine - and I thought there is the typical
picture of a pioneer and well named "Experience."</p>

<p>Civil government in Iowa proceeded with its rapid settlement. The pioneer
became a model citizen. He knew the necessity for the laws that were enacted. He did not feel oppressed by government.He had experienced the losses of robbery and larceny and knew something of the embarrassment and inconvenience of being scalped. There was no hysteria about trusts and combines because they had practiced combinations themselves for mutual protection.If any one would learn the true genius and exemplification and philosophy of self-government, government of and for and by the people, let him study the records of pioneer life, and institutional beginnings and the evolution of their laws.It would be worth our while on some suitable occasion when time permitted to talk over the interesting incidents attending the administration of justice in the early days of Iowa, and incidents of its territorial legislatures, the birth and growth of its Statehood and the characters of its officials.But the greatness
of our State is not contained in any name.Its official history is the
exponent of its industrial life and character.Its greatness is the sum total
of its citizenship.In order to be just, John Jones, the average citizen, must
be mentioned along with our most illustrious officials.Somebody said that the
history of a nation is the history of its great men, but there is an unwritten
history which that averment overlooks.The growth of a State is the progress
of its average citizen.The credit of a commonwealth is the thrift of its John
Jones and William Smith, and the character, prosperity and patriotism of the
individual citizen is the history of Iowa.</p>

<p>The population of 97,000 which she had when admitted into the Union had
increased to 754,699 at the close of the Civil war.Of these about 70,000,
almost one-tenth of the population, were in the war - a number equal to nearly
one-half the voters of the State.Who made the history of Iowa during that
great struggle of our nation's life?John Jones, the average citizen, whether
he carried a musket helping to put the scattered stars of State back into the
constellation of the Union,or whether he toiled from early dawn to lingering
twilight in the fields or in the shop.The best civilization is that which
maintains the highest standard of life for its average citizen.</p>

<p>Since the Civil war the State of Iowa has increased in population to almost
2,225,000 of people, and most of the time had the least illiteracy of any State
in the Union.Doubtless for that we are in debted to many of the older States,
whose enterprising and courageous citizens constitute so large a portion of our
population.With but half a century of statehood and with an area of but
55,475 square miles, the State of Iowa produces the greatest quantity of
cereals of any State in the Union.As long ago as the last federal census,
taken in 1890, it produced more corn, more oats, more beef, more pork than any
State in the Union.Not long since I was introduced to a gentleman from New
York City.he said:"Oh, from Iowa - ah - let me see, that's out - ah - you
see, I'm not very well posted on the geography of the West.""Yes," I said,
"it's out there just across the Mississippi river.You can leave New York
about noon and get your supper in Iowa the next evening.It might be worth
your while to look it up.It's the State which produces more of the things
which people eat than any other State in the Union.It has more miles of
railroad than your State of New York, more than Mexico, more than Brazil and
more than all the New England States combined."</p>

<p>The value of Iowa's agricultural products and live stock in round numbers for
the year 1892 was $407,000,000, to say nothing of her other great and various
industries and enterprises.She produced that year 160,000,000 lbs. of the
best butter on earth of the value of $32,000,000.The Hawkeye butter ladle has
achieved a cunning that challenges all Columbia.The Iowa cow has slowly and
painfully yet gradually and grandly worked her way upward to a shining eminence
in the eyes of the world.The State of Iowa has on her soil today, if nothing
ill befalls it, ninety million dollars' worth of corn.The permanent value of
land is estimated by its corn-producing qualities.Of all the products of the
earth, corn is king and it reigns in Iowa.</p>

<p>Industry and nature have made the State of Iowa a creditor.Her soil has
always been solvent and her system of farming does not tend to pauperize it. 
She is a constant seller, and therefore wants the evidence of the transaction
to be unimpeachable.She has more school teachers than any other State except
the Empire State and only three and six- tenths per cent of her population are
illiterate.The State of Iowa has yielded the grandest dividends on her
educational investments. She has become illustrious on account of her
enlightenment.She has progressed further from "primitive indifferent tissue"
than the land even of Darwin himself, and in her escape from protoplasm and
prejudice she is practically out of danger.Marked out in the beginning by the
hand of God, bounded on the east and west by the two great rivers of the
continent, purified and stimulated by the snows of winter, blessed with copious
rainfall in the growing season, with generous soil and stately forests
interspersed, no wonder that the dusky aborigines exclaimed when they crossed
the Father of Waters, "Iowa; this is the place."Not only did the red man give
our State its beautiful and poetic name, but Indian nomenclature runs like a
romance throughout the counties and communities.What infinite meaning, what
tokens of joy and sadness, of triumph and of tears, of valor and of
vanquishment, of life and love and song there may be in these weird, strange
words that name today so many of our towns and streams and counties; Allamakee,
Chickasaw, Dakota City, Sioux, Pocahontas, Winneshiek, Keosauqua, Sac,
Winnebago, Tama, Nodawa, Compeine, Chariton, Commanche, Cherokee, Waukon,
Muchakinock, Washta, Monona, Waupeton, Onawa, Keota, Waudina, Ioka, Ottumwa,
Oneska, Waucoma, Nishnabotna, Keokuk, Decorah, Wapello, Muscatine, Maquoketa,
Mahaska, Ocheyedan, Mississippi, Appanoose, Missouri, Quasqueton, Anamosa,
Poweshiek, Pottawattamie, Osceola, Oskaloosa, Wapsipinicon.</p>

<p>Ere long some westland genius,moved by the mystic inspiration of the rich and
wondrous heritage of Iowa nativity, may sing the song of our legends and
traditions, may voice in verse the wondrous story of his illustrious State. 
Maybe some where among the humble homes where blood and bone and brain grow
pure and strong; where simple food with frugal ways feeds wondering minds and
drives them craving into nature's secrets and her songs - somewhere along the
settler's pathway or by the Indian trail where now the country churchyards
grown with uncut grasses hide the forms of sturdy ancestors sleeping all in
peaceful ignorance of wayward sons or wondrous progeny - somewhere where rising
sun beholds the peasantry at early toil and leaves them in the mystic twilight
ere their tasks are done, where odors of the corn and new mown hay and
vine-clad hedges by the shadowy roadside linger long into the night-time, as a
sweet and sacred balm for tired hearts - somewhere sometime the song of Iowa
shall rise and live, and it will not omit the thought of that gifted son who
said:"Iowa, the affections of her people, like the rivers of her borders,
flow to an inseparable union."</p>

<p>And now, my fellow citizens, a word about out great Trans-Mississippi region,
the empire of the pioneers and of our country and its future.</p>

<p>We have on this side of the Mississippi river an area of 2,143,155 square miles
of land, two and a quarter times the area east of the Mississippi.You could
put England, Ireland, Scotland, the German Empire, France, Austria, Hungary,
Italy, Spain and all of the United States east of the Mississippi into this
Trans-Mississippi territory without touching California or Hawaii, and Admiral
Dewey would still have the Pacific Ocean and Manila, with rope enough to lasso
and hang the last enemy of the United States and civilization.</p>

<p>The population east of the Mississippi in 1890 was 45,979,754 having increased
eighteen per cent in the ten preceding years.The population west of the
Mississippi in 1890 was 16,642,496, an increase of ninety-three per cent in the
precedingdecade.The wealth per capita east of the Mississippi increased
twenty-two and three quarters per cent from 1880 to 1890 and increased
sixty-nine and one-half per cent west of the Mississippi in the same decade.</p>

<p>The State of Minnesota alone produces nearly one-eighth of the flour of the
United States and Texas furnishes one-fifth of the cotton, Iowa, Kansas,
Nebraska and Missouri produce nearly half of the entire corn product of the
country, over one-fourth of the beef and more than one-third of the pork.No
other territory in the world of equal area produces so much of the substantial
food of life.</p>

<p>Being a perpetual creditor, on account of its vast productions, the western
region and all its States have a common interest in the largest possible
employment of people in other avocations than producing food, because
employment not only creates appetite, but likewise the financial ability to
satisfy it.The western region and its many States also have a common interest
in honesty.Having given their labor for a large increase in wealth per capita
- the largest of any section of the country they are naturally interested in
maintaining it.No one has a greater interest in the vested value of a dollar
that he who has exchanged his labor and his products for it, or who has a
constant surplus to be sold and registers as accumulated wealth.You labor
today and accumulate thereby.You may want to rest tomorrow.Your
accumulation should be secure.You have been selling all these years.You may
wish to buy or build tomorrow.The credit registered by your toil, frugality
and prudence should be forever sacred.The West should look to the future and
think not only of its gains in one decade, but of the balance that will be to
its credit in a hundred years from now.Do not forget that the world must eat
and that mankind is multiplying by the millions, and that the Creator is not
making any more land on this planet.Hold fast to the heritage which God and
the pioneers have left you and to the standard of integrity and value by which
it was earned.Let the future buy from you according to that same standard by
which you have bought and by which your toil is measured in the present.</p>

<p>No one can foretell a limit of the possibilities of this great, producing,
half-developed region for the future, with the United States forging to the
front in the commerce of the world, claiming its harbors and its coaling
stations along the lines of trade in the uttermost parts of the earth and
realizing more than ever before that it is a joint proprietor with the older
nations of the earth in the great high seas.Doubtless some people are
overreckless for expansion and some are so conservative that their intellectual
estates seem almost in probate.Douglas Jerrold used to say, "There are some
people so conservative that they can never appreciate the new moon out of
regard for that venerable institution, the old one," and Wendell Phillips
added, "Some people are afraid to sweep off the cobwebs for fear the roof will
come down."But there is one thing reasonably certain:America will have a
place to land and coal her ships in every quarter of the globe.There has been
the age of marble and the age of bronze; ours if the age of commerce and of
iron.Commerce will not stop, it undermines the mountains, lays its cables
underneath the billows of the sea and scorns the fury of its crests.Commerce
is a greedy, moiling, tireless spider catching all the world in a web of iron,
and it will weave its wires wherever there is life.It has found the orient
and the occident and will never rest until it ties its cables to the poles.</p>

<p>America will build a greater navy and will build the Nicaraqua canal and her
merchant ships will take her commerce into all the harbors of the world and our
battleships shall protect our commerce in its legitimate and rightful course. 
The American flag shall be visible and revered away from home as it is beloved
and venerated here, and under it a free people shall thrive and multiply in
peace.</p>

<p>If one were to write a prophetic history of the next century and insist upon it
with any degree of obstinancy, he would doubtless be deemed insane.If
Washington, when he retired from public life, had uttered one-half the truth of
events that have since transpired, even Americans would have said that the
pressure of official responsibility had rendered the Father of his Country a
victim of dementia, and the world would have doubtless pronounced him crazy. 
If some optimist of New England had said a hundred years ago, as has transpired
and been declared since, then, that in the nineteenth century science would
pierce through mountains that ancient poetry could never scale, whisper across
the ocean, tame the lightning, annihilate space, explode superstition, create
light, bottle up sound, he might have been arrested for witchcraft.If at the
time when a hundred and eighty crimes were punishable with death, some judge or
jurist had recognized the sunrise of civilization and has declared that the
time would soon come when the greatest nation of the earth would inflict the
death penalty for only two offenses, he might have been deposed for his
opinion.If any one were to remind you now of one-half that is gone and
foretell one-half the century to come he would be regarded as a dangerous man
and rickety, and it would be used against him in the next campaign, no matter
on what ticket he should run.The fact is that not many realize the rate at
which the world is traveling.Time is so noiseless that it awakens very few. 
The Rip Van Winkles are as numerous as the Smiths and Browns and Joneses. 
While we are yet shaking hands with the events of yesterday genius taps us on
the shoulder and introduces a stranger and we exclaim, "What impostor is this?" 
An impossibility, an event of the future.</p>

<p>What shall be the events of the coming century?Probably with whatever degree
of certainty we are able to comprehend the past and to understand the present,
with that degree can we foretell the future.Yesterday and today are the
premises of a syllogism whose conclusion is tomorrow.I believe there is a
good reason for everything that happens in the universe.The indications are
that the great events of the near future shall be in the line of commerce, as I
have already indicated, of jurisprudence, of social economy, of science and of
art.The tendency of the times is to get rid of long-established humbugs.The
wisdom of the past shall be retained, but the wings of progress shall not
burdened by its evils and stupidity.So long as toil shall bend the back of
man his brain shall question science for its mysteries and so long as mystery
remains to form the boundary line of knowledge the scientists will strive and
climb and climb and reach beyond those bounds.They will make the electric
current turn the wheels of all the world.</p>

<p>And in our coming century there will be tumults, strife and riot, but there
shall be no ruin.America shall be ruled by law.She will not forget the
lessons that her patriots have taught.She will abide by the pilgrim covenant
- the legally expressed will of the majority.</p>

<p>And in the future, striving and contending with all its ceaseless, tireless
energies, in that stately and majestic march of time and toil there will be
success and failure, thrift and slothfulness, charity and meanness, hope and
doubt, happiness and misery.And some time it will lift up its voice and
America shall hear great music - such as she has never known before - and there
shall be great artists.Some one has said that America is too busy to make
verses, too serious to sing songs; that all her ideas are marshal'ed up in
battle array to solve the vital questions of self-government and that all her
jewels are wrought into diadems to crown the kings of commerce and the lords of
science, whilst poetry is swept away by the tide of activity that swells
through every artery and vein of Columbia's land.And all that has been very
true.But it shall not always be so.We shall not always take our melodies
from old operas nor our designs from ancient frescoes.We shall not always dig
our architecture from the ruins of the past nor get our fiction from the brains
of dead men.The same conditions that bred the genius of dead empires shall
find the muses and the artists for Columbia and a greater glory shall await
them, for they shall all be born in freedom.</p>

<p>By and by some millionaire, tired of killing pigs and packing pork, will see
something beautiful or maybe something sad, and he will endow an institution
where poverty can come and dream and mark its pain and thought upon the canvas
and the marble.And then some other hoarder of the millions shall grow weary
cornering kerosene and corn, and he will hear some voice or see some fair young
face with just a little line of care upon its arched and thoughtful brow, and
he will add his charity to the goodness and the greatness of America and he
will say to genius, "Come, these walls shall keep the winds form shriveling up
your tender wings on which you now may rise and soar and out of all your misery
that is past make harmonies that will soften all the sorrows of mankind, revive
the melodies that have been dying through all the centuries of time with the
pain of silence and out of the inspiration that may come to you write
rhapsodies that will lift and glorify the thoughts and minds of men and find
the very throne of God."Emerson declared a little while before he died:"We
think our civilization near its meridian, but we are kept only at tom cock
crowing and the morning star."The future will verify Emerson.The greatest
alliance ever projected in history will be the alliance of American efforts and
American interests.Into the opening gateway of the twentieth century, hand in
hand, shall spring our king of commerce and the queen of industry, the
Sphinx-eyed scientist and his bride of art, the sturdy son of agriculture and
the dreaming child of song, and their thought and toil and song shall honor and
inspire the human ace and make our country great - essentially, exquisitely,
magnificently great.</p>

<p>CHICAGO DAY.</p>

<p>October 1st, 1898.</p>

<p>The citizens of Chicago planned to make Chicago Day at our Exposition one of
its great days.Several special trains were engaged to convey the crowds from
Chicago to the Exposition.One of these trains brought Mayor Harrison, and the
city officials of Chicago, with their wives and families.The members of the
Union League Club of Chicago with their wives and friends filled another; one
conveyed the members of the Board of Trade, the Commissioners of the World's
Fair of Chicago and their friends; while another was filled with members of the
Chicago Athletic Club and the Marquette Club.Several special cars were
attached to the regular trains to accommodate the railway officials of Chicago,
the Cook County Marching Club and many other prominent citizens.With all
these prominent visitors, there came a great number on the regular trains who
took advantage of the low rate of fare the railroads had made from Chicago to
Omaha and return.The visitors began to arrive early in the day and were met
at the depot by the Exposition Officials, the Mayor and city officials and many
of Omaha's prominent citizens.A parade was formed at the depot headed by
Mayor Moores and Mayor Harrison followed by numerous bands of music and the
Cook County Marching Club in uniform.The parade marched north on Tenth Street
to Farnam, west on Farnam to 14th, where they disbanded.</p>

<p>The World's Fair Commissioners, the city officials, the speakers of the day,
and the Illinois State Commission were met at the Paxton Hotel and conveyed in
carriages to the exposition grounds.The exercises of the day were held in the
Auditorium, beginning at 11:30 o'clock A.M.The program was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music. . . Omaha Concert Band</span>
<span class="l">Invocation. . Rev. T.J. Mackay</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . Chairman Wm. H. Harper</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . President Clark E. Carr</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . Mayor Frank E. Moores</span>
<span class="l">Music. . Omaha Concert Band.</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . President G.W. Wattles</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . Mayor Carter H. Harrison</span>
<span class="l">Oration. . . Chicago and Its Relation to the West, By Ex-Comptroller Charles G. Dawes.</span>
<span class="l">Music. . Omaha Concert Band</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . The Louisiana Purchase</span>
<span class="l">By Hon. J.R. Mann of Chicago.</span>
<span class="l">Music. . The Star-Spangled Banner, By Omaha Concert Band.</span></span>

<p>Mayor Harrison spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"We are here to return the thanks of Chicago for the designation of this day in honor of their city.We represent all nationalities, all politics and all creeds. We sometimes differ at home but we are a unit in extending to Omaha our sympathy and encouragement and our congratulations on its magnificent achievement.This celebration comes at a time of glorious significance to this country.We have learned that the untried volunteers are of the stuff of which heroes are made and that Sampson, Dewey and Schley are worthy successors to Farragut and Perry. We are not only a peace-loving nation but we have found that we have the ability to make our enemies on the battlefield desire peace rather than war.</p>

<p>Referring more particularly to Chicago, Mayor Harrison said that a Chicagoan
could not tell the truth about his city without being accused of exaggeration. 
The truth about Chicago seemed like an extravagant dream to the citizen of New
York, or Boston or Philadelphia.But Omaha can understand Chicago.Her people
have the same inherent spirit and the same pluck and enterprise had made each
city what it is.In conclusion, he declared that not only on this occasion,
but in every achievement of its future, Omaha commands all the sympathy and
encouragement and inspiration that Chicago has to give."</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>Ex-Comptroller Dawes spoke in part as follows:</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven years ago fifty of the leading citizens of Chicago gathered
themselves in a little meeting under most distressing circumstances.Around
them, in smoking and somber ruins, lay what had been but a few days before the magnificent city of Chicago.Their own homes had been burned over their heads; their property of all kinds was in ashes; around them all was desolation and cheerlessness and the future seemed as dark as the present. Some of these men rose and spoke of the city as destroyed and lost forever. Its rebuilding seemed to them impossible.To their minds the great Chicago, the city of their prize and affection was numbered among the things of the past.But from among them rose a young man who amidst depressing surroundings lifted his voice in remonstrance and in prophecy of the future. "Chicago will live," said he, "and live to be so mighty and so vast that this great fire will be but an incident in its past. And Chicago will thus live because beyond her there lies the giant forces, the teaming millions and the imperial area of the mighty West, which having before created Chicago as the necessary gateway to the East, must recreate it under the same necessities."That speaker, now the secretary of the treasury of the United States, has lived to see Chicago recreated by the West, and his prophecies fulfilled to the uttermost.</p>

<p>I have thought of no better way than by the telling of this incident to
indicate the relation of Chicago to the West.</p>

<p>Chicago is the child of the West, dependent upon her for her prosperity and
progress--almost for her very existence--and far be it from her to belittle the
debt she owes.Willingly, freely, she acknowledges and rejoices in it. 
Peopled largely by western men, sustained largely by western resources, she
feels the keenest and most vital interest in the west, and I believe the Great
West takes equal interest in this young giant among the cities of the world.</p>

<p>The details of the social and commercial relations between the west and
Chicago, daily grow more intimate, daily grow more vast--relations which may
well challenge the deepest attention of the student of economics and of
American history--can receive from me today but a passing and superficial word. 
From this great section, 125 passenger trains carry over 12,000 people, rolling
daily into the depots of the city of Chicago, and an equal number of trains
depart daily from Chicago for the West.During the last year 20,000,000
bushels of western wheat, 116,000,000 bushels of western corn, 118,000,000
bushels of western oats, and 17,000,000bushels of western rye went to or
through the great commercial gateway of Chicago.Of the 46,000,000 pounds of
second class printed matter entered for the year ending June 30, 1896, at the
Chicago postoffice, the authorities of the office estimate that from 3/8 to 3/4
went to the west.Taking the postoffice average of five pieces to the pound,
we find that the total annual circulation of Chicago periodical issues in the
west must be between 130,000,000 and 172,000,000 copies--a circulation of most
surprising and pretentious magnitude.The combined mileage of the railroads
east and west of the Missouri River, binding and knitting together the west and
Chicago in ties of common interest is 67,180 miles.</p>

<p>But no catalogue of the evidence of the intimacy and vastness of the commercial
and psychological relations of the west, to Chicago, can add to our sense of
their importance.</p>

<p>The degree of contentment and prosperity experienced by the western people
under these relations of western cities, like Chicago and Omaha, to the western
country, is so important as affecting our national life and progress that these
relations now command the interest and attention of the entire people of the
United States.</p>

<p>It is generally realized that when the social problems involved in them are
solved, all the internal problems which confront our young republic, will be
solved.These people--the people of Chicago, and the rest--are not waiting for
other people or other nations to solve the great problems of today, but strong
in the consciousness of their competency for the task, they eagerly seek after
right solutions.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the development of the west has in less than two generations
brought them face to face with the problem of existence, under all social
conditions, from the most primitive to the most complex.</p>
<p>
What has thus happened before the eyes of one generation in the west has
consumed several hundred years even in other sections of our country and in
continental Europe thousands of years.Crowded into the lives of the people of
the west has been the sight of an empire builded from a wilderness.We stand
today in the midst of this magnificent exposition, an exponent of the highest
art of the world--located in this beautiful city of Omaha with its complex
nineteenth century civilization and architecture, and are startled by the
thought that the Indian and buffalo which have been brought here as objects of
curiosity lived in their native state upon this very site, less than fifty
years ago.</p>

<p>Little wonder is it that the people of the west are interested in these
relations of the western city to the western community.The fingers of fate
move in decades and not in centuries, in setting the problems for western
humanity to conquer.</p>

<p>Little wonder is it that no solution seems to difficult of attainment for those
who have seen such great transformations in the west through the successful
solutions of earlier problems equally grave.</p>

<p>And now as the genius of America, at the close of a glorious war so bravely
fought by a gallant army and navy under a great wise president, stands upon the
threshold of a dawning century and a dawning destiny, with her face toward the
fair islands of the Pacific west placed by God's hand under her guardianship,
little wonder is it that these people of the west, themselves but a short time
ago the adopted children of the wilderness, should not doubt that the path of
national duty toward the new western possessions shall again be the path of
national glory.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>Congressman Mann spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"We celebrate today the victories of peace and peaceful pursuits.Where a
magic city and a beautiful exposition now stand, the wild buffalo was chased by the savage Indian within the lifetime of many here. In the midst of this
fitting celebration of the successes of our arts of peace, while enjoying the benefits of bounteous plenty and prosperity, it is proper to recall the history of those events which have made these western states an equal part of that nation which is today the embodiment of progressive civilization and which flies the most beautiful and beloved flag ever lighted up by the sunshine or kissed by the breeze.</p>

<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">"Large streams from little fountains flow;</span>
<span class="l">Tall oaks from little acorns grow."</span></span>

<p>The little narrow fringe of settlements along the Atlantic coast has grown into
an empire which sweeps across the Continent and embraces the islands of the
sea.</p>

<p>The Louisiana Purchase more than doubled the national territory.It gave to
our country the exclusive control of the might Mississippi and its tributaries. 
It planted our possessions on the Gulf of Mexico it acquired for us the
Columbia River and a coast line on the Pacific Ocean.It brought into our
country a region having the most fertile farming and grazing lands, as well as
varied mineral resources to be found in the world, and yet its acquirement was,
as it were, only a chance shot.</p>

<p>Spain owned the entire western bank of the Mississippi River, and the eastern
bank below the 31st parallel of latitude, the boundary line fixed by the treaty
of 1795.After the war of the Revolution our country west of the Alleghenies
had begun to fill up with a class of sturdy and independent pioneer settlers. 
These settlements depended for transportation of their products wholly upon
river navigation, the only outlet for which was through the mouth of the
Mississippi, owned and controlled by Spain.</p>

<p>In 1800, by the secret treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain retroceded the province
of Louisiana to France, but without delivering possession at that time.It
became evident to the statesmen of that time that we could have no lasting
peace until we should possess one bank entire of the Mississippi River, with a
consequent right to its free navigation.</p>

<p>Jefferson was president, and did not believe that the constitution warranted
the purchase of new territory, but overcoming his scruples he rose equal to the
emergency and he commissioned James Monroe to act with Robert Livingston, then
minister to France, in an effort to purchase that part of the Louisiana
province east of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, and Congress
appropriated the sum of $2,000,000 for that purpose.</p>

<p>"It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good."Fortunately, for our own
interests, France and England were then on the verge of another war.They had
just concluded a treaty of peace, but each country was looking with dread
suspicion upon the other.England viewed with grave suspicion the re-transfer
by Spain of the immense Louisiana Province to France; and Napoleon, who was
then the first Consul of France and its ruler, quickly saw that in case of war
the English, with their superiority at sea, would immediately seize New Orleans
and the Mississippi River Valley.On Easter Sunday, April 10th, 1803, he
called two of his counselors who were most familiar with the foreign
possessions and asked their advice.He said to them:"I know the full value
of Louisiana, and I have been desirous of repairing the fault of the French
negotiator who abandoned it in 1763.A few lines of a treaty have restored it
to me, and I have scarcely recovered it when I must expect to lose it.But if
it escapes me, it shall one day cost dearer to those who oblige me to strip
myself of it, than to those to whom I wish to deliver it.The English have
successively taken from France Canada, Cape Breton, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia
and the richest portions of Asia.They shall not have the Mississippi, which
they covet."</p>

<p>After hearing from his advisors, one in favor of selling the province to the
United States, the other in favor of retaining it, Napoleon said: 
"Irresolution and deliberation are no longer in season.I renounce Louisiana. 
It is not only New Orleans that I will cede; it is the whole colony without my
reservation."</p>

<p>Monroe and Livingston had no authority to accept the offer which was made to
them by Napoleon.They could not cable for instructions.They had no time to
communicate with the home government by letter.Napoleon was not a Spanish
diplomat; he wanted his offer promptly accepted or rejected.</p>

<p>Monroe and Livingston, however, proved equal to the occasion, and after
negotiations, which lasted but a few days, the purchase was agreed upon, the
United States to pay France a principal sum of $11,250,000 payable in stocks or
bonds due in fifteen years, with interest, and the further sum of $3,750,000,
to be paid by our government to American citizens having certain valid claims
against France.</p>

<p>When the treaty became known in this country, some of the haters of President
Jefferson raised a violent outcry against its confirmation, and dire
predictions were made about the danger of extending the country in violation of
the constitution, and burdening the people with an immense debt for the purpose
of buying an uninhabitable wilderness.</p>

<p>The treaty of purchase was dated April 30, 1803, was ratified in October
following, and on December 20th, 1803, the American flag was raised over New
Orleans.No one can measure the future possibilities of these states embraced
in the Louisiana purchase.The development since the purchase in 1803 has been
more splendid than an alchemist's dream.The future will far out rival the
present and the past.</p>

<p>The value of the Louisiana purchase cannot yet be appreciated.In 1854 Omaha
was but a bare trading post.Its growth has been as rapid as the mushroom
which springs up in the night, but as strong and certain as the steel beams
which constitute the superstructures of its great buildings, and is but an
example of the genius of the west.</p>

<p>The acquisition of the Louisiana Territory was the greatest prize ever gained
by a nation at one time.By the stroke of a pen an empire changed hands.In a
moment of doubt a construction was placed upon the constitution, which
authorized the vast increase of territory.</p>

<p>The Louisiana Purchase will soon have a greater population than the country
which sold it to us.A single false step might have lost us this possession. 
All the circumstances at the time of its purchase conspired to give us a single
opportunity to gain an empire.The opportunity refused or neglected might
never have come again.</p>

<p>The France, which today maintains an army of more than half a million men
because she was compelled to cede Alsace and Lorraine to Germany, gave way to
us a possession many times Alsace and Lorraine, and gave it in friendly peace.</p>

<p>Not one of us can look far into the future.The progress of a century has
enabled us to utilize all our possessions.The lightning's fluid puts far
distant territory in a moment's communication with the capital.The expansion
of our domain and the increase of our possessions made more keen the genius and
intellect of our people.It broadened the hearts and deepened the souls of our
citizens.With the new wants, caused by long distance and varied interests,
came new ideas with which to supply those wants.New discoveries in the fields
of science, art, mechanics, follow closely the new discoveries regarding the
surface of our territory."</p>

<p>A banquet was served to the prominent guests in the Markel Cafe immediately
after the exercises, and a special sham battle was given in the afternoon for
their entertainment, followed by a reception in the evening at the Illinois
Building where many prominent citizens of Omaha gathered to pay their respects
to the honored visitors.</p>

<p>LIVE-STOCK DAY.</p>

<p>October 3, 1898.</p>

<p>As one of the great attractions of the Exposition, a livestock show had been
planned which should equal or excel any such display that had ever been made. 
Premiums to the amount of $35,000 had been voted by the Board of Directors. 
Nearly twenty acres of ground had been covered by buildings and stalls, wherein
nearly 3,000 animals were displayed, and on this day the Livestock Exhibit was
opened to the inspection of the world.No formal exercises marked the
beginning of this great exhibition, but thousands of livestock men from all
over the west swelled the attendance, and great interest was aroused by the
magnificent display which awaited their inspection.This livestock exhibit
proved a very instructive and interesting feature of the exposition, and was
pronounced one of its most successful exhibits.</p>

<p>PENNSYLVANIA DAY.</p>

<p>October 5, 1898.</p>

<p>Numerous representatives of trade organizations, members of the Pennsylvania
commission, and prominent citizens of Pennsylvania, including the Honorable
Charles Emory Smith of Philadelphia, Postmaster general of the United States,
came to celebrate their day at the Exposition.</p>

<p>A public reception was tendered Postmaster General Smith by Honorable Edward
Rosewater at the Bee Building, on the evening of October 4th.At this
reception, many prominent citizens of Omaha and visitors from all parts of the
west, paid their respects to the representative of the government.Music was
furnished, and short addresses were made.</p>

<p>The exercises for Pennsylvania Day were held at the Auditorium at 2:30 o'clock
P.M., and consisted of the following program:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music. . . Innes Band</span>
<span class="l">Address of Welcome. . Gen. Chas. F. Manderson</span>
<span class="l">Response. . . . Hon. John Woodside</span>

<span class="l">Music. . . Innes Band</span>
<span class="l">Oration. . . . Hon. Charles Emory Smith</span>
<span class="l">Post-Master General U.S.</span></span>

<p>Post-Master General Smith spoke as follows:</p>

<p>This is Pennsylvania Day.It is dedicated to the friendly interests of the
great commonwealth of the east in this splendid monument of the energy and
public spirit of the west.Philadelphia is the mother of American Exposition. 
She has seen with pride how the Centennial of 1876 has been followed by a
series of brilliant exhibitions and she has encouraged and supported them with
the same patriotic zeal which prompted her own pioneer effort.She is here
today through her representatives to congratulate you on this stately and
impressive creation.On these dazzling scenes of beauty and activity, which
typify the artistic achievements and the industrial progress of this mighty
Trans-Mississippi region.Pennsylvania fills another interest in this imposing
exhibition.To the sturdy, enlightened and enterprising citizenship which has
created this noble commonwealth she has contributed an honorable share, her
blood flows in the veins of this vigorous offspring of the adventurous spirit,
and thrift of the older sections.Her children are among the pillars of your
state.One of her sons was for years your distinguished and honored senator,
and still adorns and illuminates your civic life.Pennsylvania blends in high
degree the composite racial elements and the fruitful heritage of ancestral
diversity which have enriched and strengthened the American people; and
steadfast, stable and solid as she is, firm as the keystone of the arch she
symbolizes, she has none the less joined in the onward march and infused
something of her own characteristics in the upbuilding of this great empire of
the west. We have moved during the last six months in the swift current of
stupendous events which have recast the maps and spanned the whole horizon. We
have just emerged triumphant from a short but crucial and momentous war, which
has carried forward history and unveiled destiny.The halo it has shed on
American arms and the glory with which it has exalted the American name, fill
us with just pride and exaltation.Reluctantly accepted by the president only
under the supreme mandate of humanity and justice, once undertaken yet the
unerring seriousness of its aim, the unfaltering vigor of its direction and the
unbroken sweep of its success, stands unmatched on the pages of war.The
renown of the American navy, always brilliant, and never equaled, man for man
and gun for gun, was sustained and enhanced in every clash of the struggle. An army of 250,000 men was summoned from the ranks of citizenship, organized, equipped and made ready for action.Every soldier who fought was transported beyond the deep.The whole scene of the war was on foreign soil and in a tropical clime, under burning skies and drenching torrents, with the blight of fever and the danger of pestilence.In the face of such difficulties, what a swift and unerring triumph.</p>

<p>With our monumental victory, we face a new epoch in the history of the
republic. We come into a broader outlook, whose deep import it is well for us
to consider.The world knows our ampler reach and our larger destiny and we
feel it.No true American can be insensible to the increased respect for our
country and the higher conception of its mission which the marvelous
revelations of this war have inspired in all lands.The embattled farmers at
Lexington "fired the shot heard around the world ", and not less distinctly and
significantly did the opening shot of this war under the glittering
constellations of the Orient resound in every capital of the globe and awaken a
new understanding of America's onward movement.</p>

<p>It is recognized that the United States advances to its place as one of the
great world powers, and whatever may be our wise policy, whatever may be the
measure of our just restraint or our legitimate condition, no American can fail
to feel an honorable pride in the new distinction and the new consideration
never before approached, which American heroism and American statesmanship have
brought to our republic.The world's acknowledged tribute is the measure of
its estimate of the potency of our new position.Our use of that position will
be the measure of our wisdom and rulership.Equal to every crisis in the past,
we shall deal with this emergency in the true American spirit.It makes us
responsible for Cuba.It gives us Porto Rico.It plants our outposts on the
further side of the globe.Whatever we hold, whether it be more or less, will
be held, not for territorial aggrandizement, but solely in acceptance of
responsibilities which Providence has laid upon us.Men like to talk of
"imperialism".Our imperialism is not territorial lust, but benignant trade
expansion and civilizing influence, and our flag is at Manila, not in any
spirit of spoliation, not in either the greed or the glory of conquest, but let
it be reverently said under the controlling force of a Deity or of a
providential guidance, at the ripe hour in the development and requirements of
our national growth.</p> 

<p>It is treated in many quarters, simply as a question of territorial expansion,
but that is a secondary and incidental consideration.The great and
overshadowing question is one of commercial openings.The heart of the issue
is not mere territory but trade necessities and facilities.Beyond and behind
and beneath this departure lies the broad problem of America's destiny in the
commerce and civilization of the world.If we are to fulfill that destiny we
must have commercial expansion, and it is a profoundly significant fact which
shows a guiding hand that overrules the will of man that this war should have
come just as this great necessity begins to be realized.The opportunity
matches the need.</p>

<p>The universal acceptance of its obligation to stretch forth its civilizing hand
where the fat of war has carried it, a fortunate possession of an established
emporium on the very theater of the world's seeking, have brought the occasion
and the duty together.Is it not for enlightened American statesmanship,
watchful of American interests, to use the opportunity, not in territorial
avarice, but for commercial extension and civilizing influence in the Orient
with the base and bulwark that are needed for its support?Shall we be worthy
of this high mission?I have full faith in my countrymen.I believe in the
spirit and capacity of the American people.This war and its tremendous
question has given us a new elevation and dignity and purpose.How it has
dwarfed and diminished our domestic differences and our petty contentions!How
it has kindled the patriotic fire and quickened the true national instinct! 
How it has lifted us to a higher plane of public consciousness and to a broader
view of national greatness!In the large work before us of governing and
developing our new possessions, of ameliorating and advancing the condition of
the new people who have been brought under the protecting folds of our flag,
and of achieving the fullness of the possibilities within our grasp, there is
call for all that is best in our American courage and statesmanship and
character.</p>

<p>There is call for thoughtful, conscientious and patriotic devotion on the part
of the people.Dealing with these great questions which the future of our
country and its relations to the world make necessary/ calls for no narrow
partisanship.Let us leave our partisanship to domestic issues; let us limit
our family contests to the family circle; let us with patriotic spirit end them
at our own shores, and when we come to confront foreign countries and nations
involving our honor, our dignity and our interests before the world, let us
stand united as one people, forgetting that we are republicans or democrats,
and remembering only that we are all Americans together.</p>

<p>With single purpose and with unerring wisdom our executive has called his aides
and associates in the great work from all parties and all sections, and through
all the conflicts and all the settlement his sole thought has been the welfare
and glory of his country.It was for the American people to meet these new
questions in the same lofty spirit of patriotism, with open eyes for the
broader career before us and open hands for the higher duty and destiny of the
republic.</p>

<p>OHIO DAY</p>

<p>October 7, 1898.</p>

<p>The Governor of Ohio with his staff and numerous representative citizens from
the Buckeye State were met at the Paxton Hotel by the secretary of the Ohio
State Commission, President Wattles and members of the Bureau of Entertainment,
and conveyed in carriages to the Exposition Grounds.The line of carriages was
preceded by the Toledo Marine Band.The exercises at the Auditorium took place
at 11 o'clock A.M. and consisted of the following program:</p>

<span class="lg List">
<span class="l">Music. . . Toledo Marine Band</span>
<span class="l">Address of Welcome. . Gov. Silas A. Holcomb</span>
<span class="l">Response. . . . Gov. Asa S. Bushnell</span>
<span class="l">Music. . . Toledo Marine Band</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . . Hon. John L. Webster</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . . Co. James Kilbourne</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . . Mayor Jones of Toledo</span></span>

<p>Governor Bushnell spoke as follows:Your Excellency,- Ladies and Gentlemen: It affords me heartfelt gratification to respond on behalf of the State of Ohio, to the generous words of welcome that have been uttered by the representative of this great State and great undertaking and charming city, to those who have come to witness and participate in the honors to be paid the State and the people, of whom we are so proud.</p>

<p>It seems to me, your Excellency, that you have gathered welcomes from the
hearts of all your people and have tossed them from your lips over this
beautiful audience and I can assure you they will abide with us as sweet
for-get-me-nots of the occasion and of our visit here, and your words of
welcome will be sweet memories to us as they come floating down into our hearts with thoughts of love, of home and country.</p>

<p>Ohio rejoices in this exploitation of the marvelous development of the
Trans-Mississippi States.Ohio applauds the energy and enterprise, the ability and zeal, the courage and consummate skill which has given to our Nation and to the world this splendid manifestation of the triumphs of civilization during hardly half century of progress.Ohio recognizes the distinction given when the Trans-Mississippi States in their great Exposition program set apart this sister State to pay their tribute of respect and their homage for a deed well done.No praise or homage can be more sincere than ours; we realize the significance and the intent of this vast and magnificent demonstration in glory of this rich domain and its people; we are mindful of the righteous claim you
have to the approbation of all who love advancement in the affairs of men.</p>

<p>The great west and Ohio are indeed bound by a fraternal chain; a common
ancestry unites many of our respective people, and the States have progressed along the same lines. The enormous expanse west of the Mississippi teems with Ohioans, or the sons and daughters of Ohioans.No arm has been more potent in the redemption of that which was a vast wilderness, than that of Ohio. Her colonists have only stopped at the Pacific, and I am now told that much Ohio enterprise is manifest in Japan and the far east.I know that you will not resent this claim of ours to some of the credit that is due for the achievements now before the eyes of all men. The first settlers of our State, whether from old Connecticut, or old Virginia, were conscientious people; people who brought with them not only industry and perseverance, but also those religious principles which go so far to stamp the history of a State.</p>

<span class="lg song">
<span class="l">"Fresh from the Revolution's fire,</span>
<span class="l">They came to hew the empire's way,</span>
<span class="l">Through trackless wastes, and to inspire</span>
<span class="l">The sunlight of young freedom's day."</span></span>

<p>They founded a peerless State, and not content with such an achievement as
Ohio, some of these pioneers and their children straightway kept up the noble
work and carved four more great States out of the northwest territory.The
example thus set by Ohio's pioneers has, I verily believe, been imitated
persistently down to this day.Her children are to be found everywhere in this
matchless agricultural area.They are of sturdy stock and I know I voice the
sentiments of all when I say that their adopted States have profited by their
coming and by their staying.There is an Ohio colony in this State and an Ohio
Society of this city.Like its distinguished sister organization of the city
of New York, it is composed of strong men--those who have made their mark in
the business and professional world and who enjoy the esteem and confidence of
their fellow-men.It is, I assure you, a great pleasure to all of us who come
from the land of their birth to know that these former Ohioans have had an
active part not only in this work, but in much that has preceded it.</p>

<p>I beg of you to believe that this laudation of Ohio and Ohioans is only
inspired by my desire to obtain some credit for agency in this grand work by
which you put before all the world a plain and truthful, yet glorious, exhibit
of the wonderful fertility of your land, the strength of your industries, and
the ability of your people.Surely in such a cause one can lay stress upon any
fact or theory which will enable the claim that some of the virtue is owing to
your kindred.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself, and yet as I well know, showing the innermost thought of
many of the Ohioans who are here with us today, I must say that I cannot
express the wonder of my mind when dwelling upon the history of this Indian
country of old and its present day development.In approaching such a subject
one must, in a measure, feel some awe.It is more like the work of an Aladdin,
or a magician, who, with his wand transforms the crude into the finished
product, or from the rough material makes a splendid creation.When Ohio, in
the dignity of a youthful State, was pluming herself upon her Constitution,
upon her representatives in Congress, and upon her Government, the great region
of which in this year Omaha is now the central point, was a portion of the
District of Louisiana.When much of the history of our State had been written
this was known as the Indian country; when Ohio was plunged into the
dissensions that sometimes come with a supposed advanced state of civilization,
these were but territories.It is hard to realize, and yet we all know that it
is true.</p>

<p>Not long ago, in a convenient little book which seems to have been written for
the especial benefit of Governors of States, I came across some paragraphs
expressing opinions of those who cannot be called people of very remote age and
relating to this very district.I cannot forbear to quote a few of these, as
they seem to furnish the best means of introducing the standard by which the
Trans-Mississippi States are to be judged today.That is, they show how little
man knows of the future and how vain are his theories when dealing with mighty
nature.Let me quote now:</p>

<p>"In his Universal Geography, Jedediah Morse remarked that 'It has been supposed
that all settlers who go beyond the Mississippi River will be forever lost to
the United States.'Lieutenant Pike reported to the War Department, that 'From
these immense prairies may be derived one great advantage to the United States;
namely, the restriction of our population to some certain limits, and thereby a
continuation of the Union.They will be constrained to limit their extent to
the West, to the borders of the Missouri and Mississippi, while they leave the
prairies, incapable of cultivation, to the wandering and uncivilized aborigines
of the country.'Major Long reported that this region bore 'a manifest
resemblance to the deserts of Siberia.'The Edinburgh Review said:'There
lies the desert, except in a few spots on the borders of the rivers, incapable,
probably forever, of fixed settlements.'The North American Review (in 1858)
said:'The people of the United States have reached their inland western
frontier, and the banks of the Missouri River are the shores at the termination
of a vast ocean desert over 1,000 miles in breadth, which it is proposed to
travel, if at all, with caravans of camels, and which interpose a final barrier
to the establishment of large communities, agricultural, commercial, or even
pastoral.'"</p>

<p>And I can add to these remarks the suggestion which I think will be borne out
by the Congressional Record, that it was the great and wise and eloquent Daniel
Webster, who, in a speech opposing the institution of the wagon road across the
plains, said that no good would ever come out of the region; that it was
incapable of civilization, or cultivation.These I know are not the precise
words, but I believe the effect has been rendered faithfully.</p>

<p>You all know, in a general way, what a startling transformation has ensued in
the Trans-Mississippi country, for I do not limit the impractical line of old
to the Missouri River.It was all the same to these deluded men, who saw
nothing in the rich prairie country.At the risk of repeating facts and
figures, which may be well understood by the citizens of this region, and which
may, therefore, be trite observation, I wish to put before your minds some
statements which will give a truer conception of the immensity of the change. 
I will leave unspoken all reference to your manufacturing, to your commerce,
and to trade in general, and will deal only with that portion of the general
subject which concerns the true foundation stone of our national prosperity --
I mean AGRICULTURE.And even in agriculture I must limit the scope, for in
this country it becomes too broad for ordinary discussion.I find, according
to the Reports of the United States Department of Agriculture, that in 1896 the
states of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and North
Dakota--which we commonly call the Trans-Mississippi States, when considering
them in an agricultural sense,-- had an acreage of corn, wheat and oats under
cultivation which was very nearly 38 per cent of the whole acreage of the
United States devoted to such purposes.Furthermore, I find that upon this
acreage in the Trans-Mississippi States I have named, there was produced a
combined crop, which was over 40per cent of the whole of such production in
the Union.And again, as I have figured it, I discovered that this crop
represented very nearly 30per cent of the total value of such production in
the Union.The figures run into stupendous amounts and are almost beyond
comprehension.The wealth of Golconda could hardly have been considered in
connection with such financial results as these broad prairies produced.What
feeble efforts are those of the mining regions of the world, when one considers
them in comparison with the wealth of the cereals of these states.Again, the
thought comes, how little do we know the possibilities of the soil, or the
resources of man.To the north of us a thousand miles from here lies the
territory of our neighbor, the Dominion of Canada.But a few years ago it was
supposed that the vast expanse north of the divisional line was practically
unfit for serious effort in the way of agriculture.And yet the work is going
bravely on with great returns.It is now very nearly to the Athabasca River,
and who knows how much farther north it may go in the future.Even climatic
conditions may not be able to stop the march of progress and of civilization. 
We must not forget that the men who pronounced this region as valueless to the
white man looked only through the spectacles of the period.</p>

<p>I cannot express the degree of praise I feel for those who have accomplished
the mighty and marvelous task of making this region one of the garden spots of
the world.Even if nature was kindly in her response to the zeal and every of
the husbandman, there were yet tremendous difficulties to be overcome.The
comfort and the luxury that now surrounds many of your citizens are only
indicative of bounteous nature and hard work.There are many still who are in
the throes of the beginning, but I have every confidence that the result will
be the same in all cases where equal conscientious endeavor marks the effort. 
This Exposition speaks well for every industry of your region; it typifies, as
no other monument or enterprise reared by human hands could, the virtues of
your aims and purposes, and the success which has crowned your efforts.It is
wonderful to see, and yet it teaches a lesson plain to all men.It is the
result of the American character and, therefore, we all can share in the just
pride.</p>

<p>My countrymen, can any of us, thinking not in a vain-glorious, but in a truly
appreciative and patriotic way, form any proper conception of the strength and
power, the ability and the resourcefulness, of our great nation?Students of
all records of man have acknowledged that the American result--the direct
product of the Anglo-Saxon race--has no parallel and we have become accustomed
to the praise and wonder and perhaps the envy of the older nations as such have
been expressed from time to time.Would that we ourselves could be able to
reach some just estimate.Not that it might be used in self laudation, which
is ever unbecoming, but that all should know how great our gratitude to God
should be and how much we should value the work of our fellow-men in this
blessed land.The history of America is replete with the stories which tell
the triumphs of our people over obstacles.had any other illustration or
incident been needed it was supplied this year when the Nation, busy as it was
with its own affairs and vast interests, espoused a good cause and astonished
the world by an exhibition of quick transformation from a state of peace to
that of war. The result, as is usual with us, has been significant and
valuable. Another side of the all-conquering American nature has been shown,
and again the world is wondering and waiting for the next development.It has
seemed strange to those abroad that with such momentous matters in hand, the
nation should be able to continue business without serious interruption or
effort and that, among other evidences of unconcern, the people could take an
active part in such an affair as this, which is always supposed to be an
incident of peace. We can be proud of our country, but my fellow-citizens, even
we cannot understand her.As well might the average man attempt to estimate
the force and power of a cataract as to reach a true realization of the
colossal resources and the marvelous conditions of our republic.This creation
before us is but one exhibit--one demonstration of the power that lies behind. 
It is a striking example and a finished product, but even its human authors,
despite their hard labor, will admit that it but represents one of the fingers
of the deft and mighty hands of a nation, which under the guidance of a Divine
Providence seems destined to act for the good and the teaching of the world in
the future as it has done in the past.</p>

<p>The view we have had, and will have, today, of the achievements exhibited by
this great Exposition cannot but move us to the spirit of emulation.Not in a
boasting spirit, nor that of rivalry, but in that of fraternity, let me say
that Ohio can and must do as well at a later date.Ohio, when her century of
time shall have come, must send her greeting and her bidding to this
progressive people that they may journey eastward, even as we have come
westward, to worship at another shrine of progress and development.Five years
hence Ohio will have her Centennial, at the beautiful city of Toledo, the
metropolis of our state's northwest, whose face is bathed by the waters of the
River Maumee, and her feet by the restless waves of Lake Erie-- ever coming and
going--.A multitude of her enterprising citizens from all walks of life are
now here to second the invitation I extend you and to anticipate the assurance
of the welcome to you all by some future Governor of the State.Come to us
then as we have come to you today, with hearts swelling with pride and joy that
such a spectacle and an occasion as this can be, with generous thoughts and
words of kindness and good will, with willing eyes to see the triumphs you have
achieved and with ready hands to help lead the way to still higher paths of
honor for all our people.</p>

<p>In closing let me say that Ohio has exulted in this opportunity to do even a small part toward making this undertaking the glowing success it has proven to be. It is our hope that the bond between the States may grow stronger year by year by reason of this closer communion.Cordially and heartily we accept and treasure the assurances of amity that have been spoken.As earnestly and sincerely do we repeat the pledges for our part.I congratulate you all upon the result of your labors and wish you unbounded success and the utmost realization of your hopes in every way.</p>

<p>May your States, strong as they are in the elements that go so far to place
commonwealths in the front in the never-ending race for renown and reward, gain
still greater fame.May they is the years to come feel that there has been the
same steady advance and the same virility and power which made possible the
remarkable results which are chrystalized in the Exposition that lies before us
today.</p>

<p>NEW YORK DAY.</p>

<p>October 8, 1898.</p>

<p>A special train conveyed the members of the New York State Commission, together
with representatives of the Produce Exchange and other organizations of New
York City and state, with prominent railway officials and their guests from New
York to Omaha, arriving on the evening of October 7th.The guests were met on
their arrival by General Manager Clarkson and other Exposition officials, who
conveyed to them the invitation of the Board of Governors of the Knights of
Ak-Sar-Ben to attend the Grand Carnival Ball at the Coliseum on that evening. 
Although the guests were weary with their long journey, many of them accepted
this invitation.</p>

<p>Among the prominent guests who came were the Honorable Chauncey M. Depew, S.R. Callaway, president of the New York Central Railroad, ex-senator Warner Miller, H.B. Herbert, of the Produce Exchange, Dr. Steward Webb, Marvin Hewitt, and others.Carriages were provided, and many of these prominent guests were escorted to the Carnival Ball by exposition officials.The scene of beauty and brilliancy which met their gaze as they entered the Coliseum, caused many exclamations of pleasure and surprise.Mr. Depew pronounced the ball equal in all its appointments to any he had ever witnessed, and he derived much pleasure from meeting many of the beautiful ladies and prominent men that were in attendance.</p>

<p>Carriages conveyed the visitors from their hotels to the exposition grounds on the morning of New York Day and the exercises were held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock, A.M. and consisted of the following program:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music. . . Innes Band</span>
<span class="l">Secretary of New York Commission, Jacob Amos, Jr.,
introduced Ex-Senator Warner Miller, who made a brief
address.</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . . President Wattles</span>
<span class="l">Music. . . Innes Band</span>
<span class="l">Oration. . . . Honorable Chauncey M. Depew</span>
<span class="l">Music. . . Innes Band.</span></span>

<p>President Wattles spoke as follows:</p>

<p>With the distinguished orator, whose name and fame are known throughout the
civilized world, to follow, and whom you are impatient to hear, more than a few
formal words of welcome from me would be untimely.</p>

<p>The pleasure of welcoming to this Exposition the representative men of the
great state of new York here present is increased by the fact that it is the
state of my nativity, and by the additional fact that it is the only eastern
state represented by a building on these grounds.The wealth, intelligence and
enterprise of its citizens is illustrated a western exposition, the progressive
business organizations, the state officials and members of the Assembly were
quick to improve the opportunity of advancing the interests of the state by
patronizing a worthy enterprise, promoted in a country from which New York
State and its great metropolis derive no small part of their commerce.For the
management of this recognition and assistance.Your building here has been a
convenient home for thousands of former residents of your state who now live in
the west. Old acquaintances have been revived and new friendships formed, and
by the efficient services of the secretary of your commission the people of the
West will have many pleasant recollections of the hospitalities this home has
afforded.</p>

<p>One of the principal objects of the promoters of this Exposition was to bring
together in closer communion the diversified interests of the people of our
common country.Forty years ago a sentiment grew and expanded that the
interests of the north and of the South were not identical.This sectional
strife finally culminated in the greatest internal war of the age.As we now
look back and calmly consider the causes of this war we are led to believe it
might have been avoided and its horrors averted by a more perfect understanding
between the people of the sections involved.In later years the sentiment has
been expressed in heated political discussion that the interests of the eastern
states and especially of New York are antagonistic and at enmity with the
commercial and political interests of the West.Happily the recent contest
with a foreign foe has united all parts of our common country and has taught
the lesson that its destiny must not be dimmed by internal strife.When the
Rough Riders of the West, under the gallant leadership of that matchless
commander from the East, fought and fell in defense of humanity and our
country's flag, and won a brilliant victory over a foreign enemy, two most
important lessons were learned, first, that the intelligent and well directed
volunteer citizen soldiers of our nation are unconquerable, and, second, that
all our citizens are of the same blood and endowed with the same patriotic
instincts, whether they come from the plains of the West or the millionaire
homes of the East.</p>

<p>We celebrate today the history and progress of the greatest state in wealth,
commerce and population of our Union.We, of her nativity, look with pride on
the galaxy of great names which adorn her history.In statesmanship, was,
theology, literature, jurisprudence, invention, oratory and finance her sons
have won lasting fame.Her great metropolis is the commercial center of the
western continent.Through its business channels pulsates the commerce of an
empire.Many of the great transportation lines, which have peopled the
Trans-Mississippi country with twenty million inhabitants in the past fifty
years, are the product of the brain and the money of its financiers, and to
their genius and daring we are indebted for much of the magnificence, progress
and prosperity illustrated in these palaces of art and science, which picture a
growth and development which has been unparalleled in history.</p>

<p>We, who early emigrated from eastern states and experienced for a time the
privations of pioneer life, can fully appreciate the changes wrought since the
first whistle of the locomotive on the western prairies was heard.Fifty years
ago the ground on which this building stands was as yet public domain,
unsurveyed and unoccupied, save by Indian tribes.Since then eighty thousand
miles of railway have been constructed west of the Mississippi River.Great
cities have been built and a commerce double that of Spain and Portugal evolved
by a people gathered from all parts of the world.These transportation lines
have given value to the products of the farms, to the labor of the workshop,
and have brought to our doors the conveniences and comforts of life, and we
must accord due credit and fair legislation to the great men, who have provided
the means and the genius of affairs to make habitable these rich prairies of
the West.</p>

<p>The country which this Exposition represents will forever be the granary of the
nation.With an increase of production in the next quarter of a century equal
to that of the past, it would supply the necessities of life for the
inhabitants of the world.With the increase of population and wealth and the
higher civilization which will come to this country within the lives of many
here present today, the great commerce of the metropolis of the nation must
grow and expand, and I picture and prophecy for the state, whose history and
progress we celebrate today, a future as grand as its past has been important
in moulding the destiny and controlling the affairs of what is to be the
wealthiest, most attractive and progressive nation in the world.</p>

<p>New territory has been added to our national domains by the brilliant victories
of our recent war.The necessity of a ship canal, which shall connect the
Atlantic with the Pacific, has been fully demonstrated by recent events.The
commerce of our country must expand, and a part of the trade of the Orient must
be secured.No nation can grow rich and great by communicating only with its
own people, and we must look to the men of our metropolis for leadership in
extending our commerce and in creating our influences with foreign countries.</p>

<p>The greatness and power of our nation has within the past six months been
demonstrated as never before.Within one hundred days, and with victories
unsurpassed in history, we defeated at arms one of the oldest kingdoms of the
world.At the same time there has been maintained here in the center of our
territory an exposition for the education and elevation of our people.We have
gathered here many distinguished men from all parts of the country, but with
none are the interests and destiny of the West more closely allied than with
the representatives of the great state of New York here today.To you one and
all I present the best wishes of our people.That our relations, both business
and social, may be increased by this friendly visit, is my earnest wish.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>Mr. Depew spoke as follows:</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen:Some years ago, Chicago, the metropolis of the west,
itself the most marvelous of the creations of the latter half of this wonderful
century, reared upon the borders of Lake Michigan an industrial city.The
spirits, whose deeds in classic and eastern tale charmed our childhood, became
commonplace mortals.American genius and modern science surpassed in
suggestion and execution the works of demi-gods and genii.The stately
palaces, broad avenues lakes and canals of this home of industry and the arts
drew all the world within its walls.In its conception and administration the
World's fair at Chicago was a worthy celebration of the 400th anniversary of
the discovery of America by Columbus, and a fitting tribute to the great
explorer.</p>

<p>Our industrial progress has been during the four years since the Chicago
exposition greater than during any decade in our history.Our resources have
been developed, our markets enlarged and new avenues of employment opened.We
have, in greater measure than ever before, realized our dream of producing in
our own country everything required for our necessities or luxuries.From
practical independence of other countries for the products of their fields or
factories, we have suddenly become their competitors with our surplus, both
within and without their borders.</p>

<p>The great benefits which the World's fair at Chicago conferred upon the United
States in acquisition from foreign countries and information to foreign
governments, this Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha is to vastly enhance in
bringing nearer together in better understanding of each other the different
sections of our own country.I heard Li Hung Chang say when here that there
were many provinces in China and many Chinamen who had not heard of the war
with Japan.The light of the nineteenth century had not penetrated China's
ironclad isolation.The conflict could be varied on and ended in which her
territory was invaded, her fleet destroyed, her cities captured, tens of
thousands of her people killed, and lands and islands she had held for
centuries wrested from her, while a large part of the people of China were
peacefully pursuing their vocations, ignorant of these disasters to their
country.This exhibition has increased in industrial interest during every
hour of our war with Spain, and yet every pulsation of its activities and every
throb of the hearts of its visitors have been moved with patriotic prayers for
the success of our arms and intelligence understanding of the justice of our
cause.We have carried on a war with a foreign country, raised and equipped an
army of 250,000 men and a formidable navy, have won great victories by sea and
land, and yet though our interests and industries are so intimately connected
that a blow in any section of the country is felt everywhere, this exhibition
has as serenely continued its force as it has enthusiastically celebrated the
deeds of Dewey, Sampson, Schley and Hobson and Miles, Shafter and Merritt. 
There could be no happier illustration of the boundless resources of the United
States and its powers for peace and war.It demonstrates the versatility of
the Yankee character and its adaptability to circumstances.One thing at a
time has had its day, and no longer forms a headline of the copybook of the
American boy.Spain is so thoroughly thrashed with one hand, while the other
attends with energy and efficiency to the business of the nation.</p>

<p>New York has been too content with being the Empire State, and with having its
chief city the metropolis of the Continent, the West too eager for empire
independent of the east, the south living too much upon its traditions and in
its past, the Pacific slope resting too serenely upon its boundless
possibilities and great expectations.The war with Spain has superbly restored
the sentiment of nationality and eliminated sectional jealousies.But this
Exposition is a healthy educator for commercial union.The mission of peace is
to develop the practical side of patriotism.It is to teach and demonstrate
what will promote the development of the whole country and the prosperity and
happiness of the whole people.</p>

<p>The concentrated capital of the east is the fruit of 300 years of settlement
and trade. It is needed in the west for railroads, irrigation, mines, water
power, furnaces and mills.It furnishes the transportation facilities which
transform the prairie from the grazing plains of the buffalo and the hunting
haunts of the wolf, to the farm, the homestead and productive power in herds of
cattle and vast fields of corn and wheat.Its hopeful enterprise often finds
for it an untimely grave in booming towns, unnecessary railroads and worthless
mines. But capital is both selfish and intelligent.It never deserts a
territory because the investment has failed through bad judgment.It seeks
other sources for profitable employment and finds its remuneration in other and
needed work for the development of the country.Its freemasonry of fear is
confined by no boundaries of land or sea.In times and in places of panic and
distrust it disappears and increases the distress.With the return of
confidence it moves the machinery of society and makes possible varied
industries and prosperity.The state which so legislates as to take away all
earning power from the money it has invited or borrowed, soon learns that it
has gained a temporary advantage and lost its credit, which is the most
fruitful source of profit and prosperity.Differences between the east and the
west have been due to distance, misunderstanding and demagogues.For a time
the sections were daily becoming more widely separated.The west was
encouraged to believe that it was plundered by usurers and extortionists in the
east, and the east learned to distrust the integrity and intentions of the
west. Far-sighted citizens of the prairie and mountain states knew that the
resources of this wide territory had scarcely been touched.Drouth can be
defeated by the ditch.Millions of acres from which the homesteader had fled
in despair, and millions more known as the Great American Desert, are to become
through storage reservoirs and irrigation, fruitful farms, thriving settlements
and happy homes.</p>

<p>Education is the remedy for our troubles.The school is the preparatory
department of the college, and the college fits boys for the greater
universities of the world.The school and the college teach, they cannot
educate.The collegian can become as narrow as his village playmate who
graduated at the common school if both remain for their lifework in the
isolated environment of these local conditions, prejudices and misconceptions. 
Both of them come to this exposition.The encircling horizon which made
coincident their physical and intellectual vision, expands with their minds and
embraces states and cities, arts and industries.They see the vastness and
independence of our internal commerce.They learn that the more intelligently
selfish any business may be, the more patriotically it encourages every other
industry and contributes to the general weel.The solution of the
century-vexing problem of capital and labor grows simpler.They see that even
a railroad president may be a public-spirited citizen without betraying the
interests or lessening the business of his company; and that the money power is
the concentration of the capital of the many at convenient centers of financial
operations and contact with the world, where it lies ideal and useless in times
of distrust, but is early drawn to the beneficent purposes and productive
energies of the community which can give it profitable employment.Those from
large cities learn that New York and Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago are marts
of trade, not places of power.The country feeds and recruits them.They
reflect and do not originate the conditions and opinions of the republic.The
untraveled city man is the most provincial of mortals.His local pride
paralyzes his powers of observation, and the rest of the universe exists only
for his benefit and by his permission.The west is an unknown land of grazing
plains, mining camps and big game.But he finds here the broadest culture of
the schools and colleges, a vigorous and healthy public sentiment, the courage
to try and the ability to utilize every invention which will increase the
productive power and decrease the cost of operating the farm, the forest, the
manufactory and the mine.Thus the broader education brings into contact and
activity all the elements of our strength and growth.Self-centered
satisfaction is an insurmountable barrier to mental, moral or material growth.</p>

<p>Foreign critics say Americans boast of the bigness of their country.There is
no use denying the fact; we are big.We are not too large for a destiny never
so manifest as today.Cuba is under our protection and certain to come under
our flag by the vote of her people; Porto Rico is ours; our foothold in the
Philippines will never be surrendered, and the markets in the far East are
inviting us to compete with the nations of Europe for their trade.Big as we
are, the future is bigger with duties, responsibilities and opportunities for
our citizens.The sentimentalist declares that such a review as has occupied
our hour today is the grossest materialism.After years of experiment and
observation I have found that sentiment has less alloy, is purer and attains
loftier ideals under a well-thatched roof than on the sod, under storms as well
as sunshine, and with drenching clouds as well as stars above."What makes a
hero in battle," I inquired of a veteran, the victor on many a bloody field. 
His answer was, "Plenty of good beef or mutton and hot coffee".</p>

<p>When Nebraska has reached the age of New York there will be a population of
over 200,000,000 in the United States.Our domain will be sufficient for their
support, and our institutions elastic enough for their orderly government and
their liberty.Intelligence will be keen and high and the state will be very
close to the daily life and industrial activities of the people.Cooperation
will be working to an extent now thought chimerical.There will be always
differences of conditions as God has endowed his children with degrees of
gifts, but the much abused doctrine that the world owes every man a living will
be in general vogue and practice.The lazy, the shiftless and the improvident
will grumble and suffer then as now, but there will be a place for all
according to the talents bestowed upon them, and wisely perfected plans for the
care and comfort of the aged and helpless.</p>

<p>The war with Spain has unified our country.The sons of the south and the
north fighting side by side, and under the old flag, has effaced the last
vestige of the passions of the Civil War.The young men of the farthest west
and its primitive conditions, lying with their comrades from the circles of the Clubs and fashion in the east, in the trenches of El Caney and charging up the hill and over the defenses of San Juan have made the men of the west and the east one by the baptism of blood.Whether from the plains of Arizona or the palaces of New York and whether dressed in broadcloth or in buckskin the Rough Rider is the same American.</p>

<p>Venerable New York sends hail and ordeal congratulations to young Nebraska. Our settlement is two hundred and forty and our sovereignty ninety years older than yours.Three centuries of development under original conditions, and free institutions, greet this half century of the west from the painted savage to the industrious citizen with a past and present full of cheer and hope. First among the states of the Republic in population, prosperity, educational institutions, churches, productive power and wealth, and commanding the resources of the continent through her metropolis, the second city of the world, New York owes it all to American liberty and opportunity. It is her pride and pleasure to attract and welcome the citizens of all the sister states.The people of the south, the west and the Pacific, have found hospitable homes in the Empire State in numbers greater than the population of many cities, in those sections.These fraternal ties intertwining with the bonds of patriotism and common interest bind our states together in one indissoluble Union, and make us all one people, of one country and under one flag.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>The Board of Governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben in their gay
uniforms, formed the escort of honor, and as the distinguished guestspassed
along the streets, tens of thousands of the citizens of Omaha andvisitors at
the exposition greeted the President and the other notedofficials with great
enthusiasm.Every available space along the streetswas occupied, and in
front of the City Hall, completely filling thestreet and the court-house
square, the largest concourse of people evergathered within our city awaited
the arrival of the President of theUnited States and his party.
On the reviewing stand in front of the City Hall were gathered many
representative citizens of Omaha and the west, and as President McKinley
appeared, a great shout of welcome went up and it was with extremedifficulty
that it was restored and a way cleared through the street forthe passing
pageant.</p>

<p>President McKinley paid his respects to the Mayor of the city by an
official call at his office and after many compliments on the magnificent
spectacle he had witnessed, he retired with the other members of hisparty,
and was conveyed to the Omaha Club, which had been generouslytendered by its
members to the exclusive use of the president and hiscabinet.</p>

<p>At the Club a magnificent banquet was served to the distinguished
guests by the officers of the exposition, and it was a late hour when all
retired to await the morning of</p>

<p>PRESIDENT'S DAY.</p>

<p>October 12, 1898.</p>

<p>At an early hour before the gates of the exposition were opened,
thousands of visitors had made their way by every possible means of
conveyance to the exposition grounds.It was early seen that theadmissions
department of the exposition would be put to the test topromptly pass
through the gates the immense throngs which would on thisday attend.Street
cars, railway trains, carriages, and every possible means of conveyance were
taxed to their utmost to carry the crowds to the exposition grounds.</p>

<p>The 2nd Nebraska Regiment had been specially invited and werepresent
to assist the exposition guards in the preservation of order onthe grounds. 
This regiment was drawn up in two solid lines reaching fromthe entrance to
the Bluff Tract to the Grand Stand, forming a passage-waythrough the immense
crowds that filled the grounds.At 10:30 thedistinguished guests in
carriages in the order of the evening before,arrived at the grounds and were
admitted and passed through the crowdbetween the lines of soldiers to the
grand stand on the plaza, where theexercises of the day were to be held.In
front of the grand stand,reaching westward to the viaduct, and on all sides
was gathered anaudience such as will probably never again be seen within
this city.Ithas been estimated that this audience numbered 70,000 people. 
Theexercises of the day consisted of the following program:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music. . . Innes Band.</span>
<span class="l">Invocation. . . Rev. John McQuoid</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . . President Gurdon W. Wattles</span>

<p>President Wattles spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Our hearts are filled with gratitude and thanksgiving today because
of the welcome return ofpeace to our nation.We meet to celebrate the
victories of our arms and to rejoice that the clouds of war have passedand
that the sunbeams of peace again bathe our beloved land I voice thesentiment
of all the inhabitants of our country in expressions of welcomeand heartfelt
greetings to our beloved President, our honored guesttoday.If I could
gather from the hearts of our people the love andadoration they feel for
him, and present it, like sweet flowers intangible form, I might in a faint
degree offer a welcome worthy of theoccasion.Words fail to express and
language cannot convey the joy andgratitude we feel that the President of
this great nation, accompanied bymembers of his cabinet, by representatives
of foreign countries, by greatgenerals of the army and navy, and by many
others distinguished in thecouncils of the nations, have come to join with
us in this celebration.</p>

<p>At no more fitting place, than here in the center of our territory
surrounded by such magnificent evidences of the arts of peace, could this
celebration be held.No better illustration of the greatness and powerof
our people can be found than the demonstration here made.During the
progress of our recent war we have been celebrating here the triumphs and
achievements of our people on the peaceful pursuits of the principal
industries of the nation.</p>

<p>Aided by generous legislation of Congress the departments of stateand
the functions of our government have been illustrated in thebeautiful
building which adorns the Court of Honor of this exposition. By the same
beneficent legislation a congress of the Indian tribes, whichonce inhabited
this region, has been assembled on these grounds.Theserepresentatives of a
fast-fading race, which for many years contested bywar and massacre the
westward march of civilization, now dwell in peaceand contentment and daily
celebrate their rites and victories, surroundedby the triumphs of
civilization.</p>

<p>The people of the North and the South have mingled here and have
pledged anew the patriotism and love which now binds with bonds of steelall
sections of their common country.With the inspiring music of"Dixie" and
"The Star-Spangled Banner" they have celebrated togetherunder the stars and
stripes of the united nation each victory of her armson land and sea.</p>

<p>With peace, prosperity, happiness and contentment throughout theland
we meet to rejoice and celebrate the triumphs of our arms in a warwaged for
humanity.All honor to our soldiers and sailors, who, withbravery and valor
unknown to history, defeated with signal victories ourforeign foe.All
praise to their gallant commanders, who led the way andplanted the stars and
stripes on distant isles as a symbol of liberty andlove, which will forever
guarantee the blessings of freedom of God.AllHail to the chief, who
inspired by God of pity, love and justice,proclaimed that cruelty and
oppression could no longer be tolerated andmust forever be banished from the
isles along our shores.All Hail tothe chief who sent to a suffering people
the aid of a mighty nation.AllHail to our President, our guest and our
ruler. Hail!Hail!</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>President McKinley spoke as follows:</p>

<p>Gentlemen of the Transmississippi Exposition and Fellow-Citizens: It
is with genuine pleasure that I meet once more the people of Omaha,whose
wealth of welcome is not altogether unfamiliar to me and whose warmhearts
have before touched and moved me.For this renewed manifestationof your
regard and for the cordial reception of today my heart respondswith profound
gratitude and a deep appreciation which I cannot conceal,and which the
language of compliment is inadequate to convey.Mygreeting is not alone to
your city and the state of Nebraska but to thepeople of all the states of
the transmississippi group participatinghere, and I cannot withhold
congratulations on the evidences of theirprosperity furnished by this great
exposition.If testimony were neededto establish the fact that their pluck
has not deserted them and thatprosperity is again with them it is found
here.This picture dispels alldoubt.</p>

<p>In an age of expositions they have added yet another magnificent
example.The historical celebrations at Philadelphia and Chicago, andthe
splendid exhibits at New Orleans, Atlanta, and Nashville, are now apart of
the past, and yet in influence they stilllive, and theirbeneficent results
are closely interwoven with our national development. Similar rewards will
honor the authors and patrons of theTransmississippi and International
Exposition.Their contribution willmark another epoch in the nation's
material advancement.</p>

<p>One of the great laws of life is progress, and nowhere have the
principles of this law been so strikingly illustrated as in the United
States.A century and a decade of our national life have turned doubtinto
conviction; changed experiment into demonstration; revolutionizedold methods
and won new triumphs which have challenged the attention ofthe world.This
is true not only of the accumulation of material wealthand advance in
education, science, invention and manufactures, but aboveall in the
opportunities to the people for their own elevation which havebeen secured
by wise free government.</p>

<p>Hitherto, in peace and in war, with additions to our territory and
slight changes in our laws, we have steadily enforced the spirit of the
constitution secured to us by the noble self-sacrifice and far-seeing
sagacity of our ancestors.We have avoided the temptations of conquestin
the spirit of gain.With an increasing love for our institutions andan
abiding faith in their stability, we have made the triumphs of oursystem of
government in the progress and the prosperity of our people aninspiration to
the whole human race.Confronted at this moment by newand grave problems,
we must recognize that their solution will affect notourselves alone but
others of the family of nations.</p>

<p>In this age of frequent interchange and mutual dependency, we cannot
shirk our international responsibilities if we would; they must be metwith
courage and wisdom and we must follow duty even if desire opposes. No
deliberation can be too mature, or self-control too constant, in thissolemn
hour of our history.We must avoid the temptation of undueaggression, and
aim to secure only such results as will promote our ownand the general good.
It has been said by some one that the normal condition of nations is
war.That is not true of the United States.We never enter upon waruntil
every effort for peace without it has been exhausted.Ours hasnever been a
military government.Peace, with whose blessings we havebeen so singularly
favored, is the national desire, and the goal of everyAmerican aspiration.</p>

<p>On the 25th of April, for the first time for more than a generation,
the United States sounded the call to arms.The banners of war were
unfurled; the best and bravest from every section responded; a mightyarmy
was enrolled; the north and the south vied with each other inpatriotic
devotion; science was invoked to furnish its most effectiveweapons;
factories were rushed to supply equipment; the youth and theveteran joined
in freely offering their services to their country;volunteers and regulars
and all the people rallied to the support of therepublic.There was no
break in the line, no halt in the march, no fearin the heart.No resistance
to the patriotic impulse at home, nosuccessful resistance to the patriotic
spirit of the troops fighting indistant waters or on a foreign shore!</p>

<p>What a wonderful experience it has been from the standpoint of
patriotism and achievement!The storm broke so suddenly that it was here
almost before we realized it.Our navy was too small, though forcefulwith
its modern equipment and most fortunate in its trained officers andsailors. 
Our army had years ago been reduced to a peace footing.We hadonly 19,000
available troops when the war was declared, but the accountwhich officers
and men gave of themselves on the battlefields has neverbeen surpassed.The
manhood was there and everywhere.Americanpatriotism was there and its
resources were limitless.The courageousand invincible spirit of the people
proved glorious, and those who alittle more than a third of a third of a
century ago were divided and atwar with each other were again united under
the holy standard of liberty. Patriotism banished party feeling; $50,000,000
for the national defensewas appropriated without debate or division, as a
matter of course, andas only a mere indication of our mighty reserve power.</p>

<p>But if this is true of the beginning of the war, what shall we sayof
it now, with hostilities suspended, and peace near at hand, as wefervently
hope?Matchless in its results!Unequaled in its completenessand the quick
succession with which victory follow victory!Attainedearlier than it was
believed to be possible; so comprehensive in itssweep that every thoughtful
man feels the weight of responsibility whichhas been so suddenly thrust upon
us.And above all and beyond all, thevalor of the American army and the
bravery of the American navy and themajesty of the American name stand forth
in unsullied glory, while thehumanity of our purposes and the magnanimity of
our conduct have given towar, always horrible, touches of noble generosity,
Christian sympathy andcharity, and examples of human grandeur which can
never be lost tomankind.Passion and bitterness formed no part of our
impelling motive,and it is gratifying to feel that humanity triumphed at
every step of thewar's progress.</p>

<p>The heroes of Manila and Santiago and Porto Rico have made immortal
history.They are worthy successors and descendants of Washington, and
Greene; of Paul Jones, Decatur and Hull, and of Grant, Sherman, Sheridanand
Logan; of Farragut, Porter and Cushing, and of Lee, Jackson and Longstreet.</p>

<p>New names stand out on the honor roll of the nation's great men and
with them unnamed stand the heroes of the trenches and the forecastle,
invincible in battle and uncomplaining in death.The intelligent, loyal,
indomitable soldier and sailor and marine regular and volunteer, areentitled
to equal praise as having done their whole duty whether at homeor under the
baptism of foreign fire.</p>

<p>Who will dim the splendor of their achievements? Who will withhold
from them their well-earned distinction! Who will intrude detraction atthis
time to belittle the manly spirit of the American youth and impairthe
usefulness of the American army? Who will embarrass the governmentby sowing
deeds of dissatisfaction among the brave men who stand ready toserve and
die, if need be, for their country!Who will darken thecounsels of the
republic in this hour requiring the united wisdom of all!</p>

<p>Shall we deny to ourselves what the rest of the world so freely and so
justly accord to us?The men who endured in the short but decisivestruggle
its hardships, its privations, whether in field or camp, on shipor in the
siege, and planned and achieved its victories, will nevertolerate
impeachment, either direct or indirect, of those who won a peacewhose great
gain to civilization is yet unknown and unwritten.</p>

<p>The faith of a Christian nation recognizes the hand of Almighty Godin
the ordeal through which we have passed.Divine favor seemed manifest
everywhere.In fighting for humanity's sake we have been signallyblessed. 
We did not seek war.To avoid it if this could be done injustice and honor
to the rights of our neighbors and ourselves was ourconstant prayer.The
war was no more invited by us than were thequestions which are laid at our
door by its results.Now, as then, wewill do our duty.The problems will
not be solved in a day.patiencewill be required; patience combined with
sincerity of purpose andunshaken resolution to do right, seeking only the
highest good of thenation and recognizing no other obligation, pursuing no
other path butthat of duty.</p>

<p>Right action follows right purpose.We may not at all times be able
to divine the future, the way may not always seem clear; but if our aimsare
high and unselfish, somehow and in some way the right end will bereached. 
The genius of the nation, its freedom, its wisdom, itshumanity, its courage,
its justice, favored by Divine Providence, willmake it equal to every task
and the master of every emergency."</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>At the close of the speaking an informal reception was held and
congratulations were extended to the president by the expositionofficials
and other prominent guests on the platform.A great cheer wentup from the
immense audience but President McKinley, with his usualthoughtfulness for
others, suggested to President Wattles that the crowdswere cheering for
General Miles and other distinguished officers who hadnot participated in
the program, and at his suggestion General Miles, themembers of his cabinet,
and others, were called out and introduced to theenthusiastic throng, in
order that they, his associates, might share thehonors that he said were due
to them as much as to himself.</p>

<p>His delicate thoughtfulness for the pleasure of others was again
illustrated when he handed to President Wattles the original manuscriptfrom
which he had read his address, as a souvenir of the occasion.</p>

<p>After the general hand-shaking and cheering at the grand stand had
been concluded, the ladies were escorted to the carriages and departed at
once for the Omaha Club, where a formal luncheon had been prepared in
anticipation of the presence of Mrs. McKinley.Unfortunately she hadbeen
detained at their home at Canton, Omaha, but the wives of members ofhis
cabinet and of other officials made up the party who, with the ladiesof the
Bureau of Entertainment, were served at the Club.This luncheonwas one of
unusual elegance.The rooms of the Club were filled withroses.The tables
in the dining-room were arranged in the form of ahollow square.The
luncheon card was printed on white satin ribbonattached to heavy cardboard,
and ornamented with handpainted sketches. The menu was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg menu">
<span class="l">Grape Fruit</span>
<span class="l">Consomme</span>
<span class="l">Frogs' Legs a la Paulette</span>
<span class="l">Breast of Chicken</span>

<span class="l">Neapolitan Ice Cream</span>
<span class="l">Assorted Cake</span>

<p>Mrs. Clement Chase, chairman of the bureau of entertainment,presided. 
At her right sat the wife of the Chinese Minister.At herleft the wife of
the Corean Minister.Next in order at her right satMrs. H. T. Clark and
Mrs. Lyman Gage.Next to the wife of the CoreanMinister sat Mrs. Wattles
and Mrs. Charles Emory Smith.Seated at theother tables were the following
ladies:</p>

<p>Mrs. Kirkendall, Miss Wilson, Mrs. Webster, Mrs. Miles, Mrs.Summers,
Mrs. Humphrey, Mrs. Manderson, Mrs. Moore, Mrs. Babcock, 
Miss Miles, Mrs. Cowin, Mrs. Adams, Mrs. Lindsey, Mrs. Richards, Mrs.

<p>The gentlemen of the party retired to the Markel Cafe, where aformal
luncheon was served to them. At this luncheon no toasts were given except
that the health of the president was pledged by all present.</p>

<p>The program of the day had been arranged with the special plan of
allowing as many of those on the grounds as possible the privilege ofseeing
the president at short range.The soldiers of the 2nd Regimentwere formed
in two lines around the grand court, through the center aisleof each of the
main buildings, and after the luncheon was over thePresident, escorted by
President Wattles and followed by the otherofficials in their order, marched
between these lines of soldierscompletely around the grand court, stopping
at the government building inwhich it had been planned to hold a public
reception.The governmentcommission had admitted several hundred prominent
officials and citizensby card, and after these had been presented to the
president soon becameevident that it would be impracticable to admit the
general public tothis reception, as the president was already weary with
hand-shaking. This feature of the program was therefore abandoned and the
partyproceeded on their way to the rooms of the bureau of entertainment in
themines and mining building where a short rest was enjoyed while they
awaited the arrival of the ladies from the Club.</p>

<p>Thousands of women delegates to the Transmississippi Congress of the
Federation of Women's Clubs had congregated and by special appointment
President McKinley and President Wattles visited for a few moments this
gathering of the representative women of the west.President McKinleywas
introduced and spoke a few words of encouragement to this audience.
Carriages were then taken and the guests were conveyed through the Midwayand
over the North Viaduct to the Indian Encampment.Here the GreatFather was
welcomed by the Indian Tribe with an enthusiasm and in amanner never to be
forgotten.A grand parade of the many tribes bedeckedin costumes peculiar
to their customs was lead past the reviewing standby Captain Mercer, who had
charge of the Indian Congress.</p>

<p>Next a sham battle of Indian braves was enacted, which was made so
realistic that it almost seemed to be a re-enactment of one of the bloody
battles which had taken place in earlier times.This display of savagelife
was much enjoyed by the President and all who witnessed it, and atits
conclusion many of the Indians gathered near the exit of thereviewing stand
to see and if might be, speak with the Great Father, whothey regarded with
awe, as he came among them.The President insisted ondischarging the
carriages and walking back to the Cafe where dinner wasto be served.The
way led past the live stock exhibits, and many of thefinest animals of this
exhibit were displayed with great pride by theirowners to the President as
he passed.The gay throngs on the Midwaycheered him, the old soldiers
called his name in endearing terms, and thejourney was one of interest and
pleasure, with no single word ofdiscourtesy to mar a day filled with many
pleasant events.</p>

<p>The dinner at the Cafe had been planned with great care and to ithad
been invited all of the officers of the exposition, the executivecommission,
and the full board of directors.Also members of thegovernment exposition
commission, members of the state commissions andnumerous prominent citizens. 
The long tables entirely filled the northcafe, and were beautifully
decorated with flowers. The menu was one ofspecial elegance in design. A
reproduction of the Government Buildingappeared on the first page. On the
second page was lithographed</p>

<p>President Wattles sat at the head of the table with PresidentMcKinley
at his right.The members of the president's cabinet andforeign ministers
were seated on either side according to rank.Thedinner was faultlessly
served.No formal toasts had been planned forthis dinner but as the evening
was too disagreeable to carry out theoriginal plan of a boat-ride on the
lagoon, it was suggested that an hourbe spent listening to impromptu
speeches.Toasts were assigned byPresident Wattles at President McKinley's
suggestion, as follows:</p>

<p>"Our Country", St. Clair McKelway, Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle.
"From War to Peace", General Nelson A. Miles."Humanity", Senator JohnM.
Thurston."The Exposition", General Charles F. Manderson."The NewWest",
Governor Alva Adams of Colorado.</p>

<p>After the responses, which were exceptionally interesting, theguests
repaired to their carriages and were driven around the court ofhonor and to
the grounds set aside for fireworks on the north tract.Amagnificent
display had been specially prepared for this occasion, and itwas greatly
enjoyed by the tens of thousands who witnessed it.Thecarriages then
conveyed the distinguished guests to the Omaha Club andthus closed
President's Day at the Exposition.</p> 

<p>The President had planned to leave the city for St. Louis, early the
next morning, and without ceremony he was escorted to the depot.A large
number had gathered there to see him once more and say "Goodby".Before
leaving the Club he had written General Manderson a note as follows:</p>

<p>"Dear General Manderson:</p>

<p>Before I go, permit me to thank you.My visit to Omaha hasbeen
of uncommon interest and pleasure.</p>

<p>Goodbye,</p>

<p>Oct. 13, 1898. William McKinley."</p>


<p>The President expressed to President Wattles his appreciation of the
splendid manner in which he had been entertained. He said:</p>

<p>"I want to congratulate Omaha on the splendid management of every
detail of my reception, which was carried out most satisfactorily and inthe
best way possible."</p>

<p>As the train was about to start, he responded to the cheers of the
crowds gathered about his car as follows:</p>

<p>"I thank you more than words can tell for your many kindnesses to me
during my visit to your city and your magnificent exposition.My visitto
Omaha and to the Transmississippi is one that I shall long rememberwith the
kindliest recollections.What has pleased me more than anythingelse on my
entire trip is to witness the exhibitions of patriotismthroughout the
country.I am glad to see that in Nebraska, as throughthe whole land, the
people ever love good government and dearly/love theold flag.It is very
hard for me to say goodby to Omaha; you have allmade my trip so delightful. 
But I must say goodby now, as the train isabout to leave.Again I thank
you."</p>

<p>ARMY AND NAVY DAY.</p>

<p>October 13, 1898.</p>

<p>After the departure of the president and his party, the exposition
officials repaired to the hotels and with carriages escorted GeneralMiles
and staff with other generals, ministers and officials, who were to
participate in the celebration of Army and Navy Day, to the Exposition
Grounds.The exercises were held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock A.M. The
program was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg program">
<span class="l">Music-Song-By Modoc Glee Club, Topeka, Kansas,</span>
<span class="l">Hail, Flag of the Free!</span>
<span class="l">Welcome. . . Gov. Silas A. Holcomb.</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . General Nelson A. Miles.</span>
<span class="l">Music . . Modoc Glee Club.</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . General A.W. Greeley.</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . Senator Wm. V. Allen.</span></span>

<p>General Miles spoke as follows:</p>

<p>It is gratifying to know that the people of the mighty west gathered
inthis great exposition have set apart one day in which to honor thearmy
and navy of the United States.Speaking for the army I may say ithas been
most closely identified with the welfare, progress andprosperity of the west
than with any other portion of this great country. It was up this river that
was led in the early years of the century alittle band of explorers past the
site of your beautiful city, anddestined to discover the wealth, the
resources and the beauties of ournewly acquired and vast territory extending
from the "Father of Waters"to the broad Pacific, and render immortal the
names of Lewis and Clark. It was near this spot that many of the most
important expeditions havebeen organized and equipped for the exploration
and conquest of thewilderness occupied by numerous and powerful tribes of
savages, and itwas here that the army found ever cordial welcome upon
returning fromthese perilous and hazardous enterprises.Here was initiated
that greatexpedition which wound its way slowly among the hills into the
plain, andthen with steadily increasing speed until the stroke of a hammer
upon agolden nail telegraphed to the world on the 9th of May, 1869, the
completion of the first trans-continental line and a prophecy of the
matchless material progress whose fruition we see now demonstrated here.</p>

<p>Individually, there is no place where I feel more at home than inthe
great west. Twenty-six of the best years of my life have been spentin
service west of the Missouri river.As I have been identified withits
trials and privations, and in full sympathy with its sacrifices andits
heroic struggle, so I have had the pleasure of witnessing itsmarvelous
growth and development and its grand splendid prosperity.</p>

<p>Here we find the true spirit of American enterprise.It was the
prospect of these fields which tempted from their homes the most heroic,the
most resolute and the boldest spirits, whose children having caughtthe
inspiration of their fathers are now, in independence of character,true,
progressive spirit, intelligence and integrity, in the front rankof
citizenship.</p>

<p>The hardships endured and sacrifices made by the army, deprived of
many of the advantages of civilization, in its service on the frontierhave
been little known and little heeded or appreciated by the averagecitizen in
the eastern portion of the United States, yet there has notbeen a camp of
pioneers, of miners, of herdsmen, or of colonists in thevast and trackless
wilderness of fifty years ago who have not found theprotecting presence of
the resolute and faithful soldier standing wardbetween the defenseless and
the savage.During that period there hascome such a transformation as was
never before witnessed in the wholehistory of the human race.A trackless
wilderness and barren waste hasbeen transformed into communities and states
which exert themselves infriendly rivalry to excel each other in modern
industries, sciences, artand institutions of learning.The army rejoices in
your magnificentprosperity.
Let us remember that the army of the United States received its
inspiration of integrity, honor and fortitude from the precept andexample of
that most eminent and perfect soldier, citizen and statesman,its first
commander, George Washington.The army does not forget, andthe country
should not, his injunction to his countrymen that "timelydisbursements to
prepare for danger frequently prevent much greaterdisbursements to repel
it;" and we may well emphasize the doctrine thatto insure peace, we should
be prepared for war.There are other maximsof General Washington to which
we should recur at the present time.Forinstance, "the great rule of
conduct for us in regard to foreign nations,is in extending our commercial
relations to have with them as littlepolitical connection as possible."</p>

<p>Another of incalculable importance now and always, is "promote thenas
an object of prime importance the situations for the general diffusionof
knowledge.In proportion as the structure of the government givesforth to
public opinion, it is essential that the public opinion shouldbe
enlightened."</p>

<p>The great element of strength for a republic and especially for an
army, is the universal intelligence of its citizens and soldiers.A
democratic government cannot safely exist where this is wanted.In orderto
be a well-equipped soldier, with us, a man must be first wellinformed,
having due regard for the advantages, blessings andrequirements of our
institutions, and appreciating the obligation of thecitizen to his
government, realizing that without patriotism,independence of character and
integrity of purpose, a man cannot fulfillthe requirements of American
citizenship.Intelligent patriotism inaddition, when the citizen undertakes
service in the army or the navy, sodemonstrates the fact that he possesses
still another of the noblesttraits of manhood and fortitude to meet the
entries of his country, andif need be die to uphold the honor of his flag
and the existence of hisgovernment.This has been the record of the
American soldier for morethan a hundred years.He is not forced to maintain
a dynasty or supportthe power of a monarch, but he volunteer's to serve for
his country'sgood and for the protection, welfare and benefits of all who
dwell withinthe borders of the commonwealth.For more than a century the
history ofour army is one of glorious achievement and fortitude.Scarcely a
yearhas passed but that the army has had to contend against a savage, crafty
and warlike race, from the time of Washington to the present day.The
history of heroic service in those years gilds with an immortal fame the
names and records of those men participating in the wars whose sacrifices
have amounted to a larger percentage of casualties than in those of thegreat
wars between civilized nations.It was in that school thatWashington
himself had his first important lessons in the art of war, andthe same can
be said of Putnam, Greene, Schuyler, Marion, Wayne, Morgan,Jackson, Worth,
Taylor, and indeed, Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Our army is made up of quite different material from that of thegreat
armies of Europe.The officers belong to no one family or class of
aristocracy. They come from the public schools, the farms, the counting- 
houses, and the colleges of the land.Many of them enlisted in theranks,
and through merit, industry and gallantry have fought their way tothe
highest position of honor and responsibility.The people of everystate and
the best families and elements of society are represented bysoldiers in the
ranks of the American army.I have hoped for many yearsthat the American
army might become a grand school of patriotism in whichboys and young men
enter, and while serving their country benefitthemselves by gaining a
thorough knowledge of the principles of ourgovernment, of our history, and
the advantages of our institutions, andadd to their knowledge how best they
may serve their country in the hoursof national peril and public danger. 
Possibly we have been too unmindfulof this during the last five and thirty
years.For four years precedingthat period our nation was engulfed in
gloom, in the smoke and turmoil ofterrible civil war, and only after four
years of sacrifice and sufferingdid it emerge to a glorious epoch of peace
and prosperity.</p>

<p>During the period of development of the great west and marvelous
prosperity of the following thirty years, people became indifferent tothe
condition of our army and navy, and as a result of that indifferencewe have
found it necessary to mobilize an army for a foreign war withoutprevious
preparation and without the elements of equipment essential toits
efficiency.Whether we shall profit by the experience of the lastfew months
remains to be seen.The enormous expenditure of public moneyand the
numberless complaints of suffering and hardship should, in myopinion, prompt
the people to due attention to the necessity of having inthe future a
well-equipped military force commensurate with our interestsas a nation, and
with the requirements of our people here and thoseliving beneath our flag in
any quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>I have for many years advocated the principle of having one soldierto
every 1,000 of our population thoroughly instructed in the duties and
requirements of military life, and I think that standard could bemaintained
in the future.As a nation grows in strength andresponsibility, those two
pillows of support--its army and navy--shouldgrow in proportion.I believe
that our ships should be known in everysea, and with extended commerce there
should be built up of Americanmaterial, armed with American guns, manned by
American seamen, a navysufficient to protect our flag, and our interests in
every quarter of theglobe.</p>

<p>During the past few months our country has passed through an ordeal
which ought not to be repeated.The experience should teach us that tensand
hundreds of thousands of even the flower of our citizens cannotsuddenly be
molded into well equipped, well officered, well supplied,well disciplined
troops in a few months.</p>

<p>Whatever there has been of failure, of short-comings, of distress or
of suffering--above all whatever there has been of hardships or horrorsof
war, the American army has written upon the pages of history a pagethat will
illumine its name forever; and it has met every privation, ithas encountered
every hardship, and it has faced every peril on land andsea incident to the
war, and while it has captured guns, battle-fields,prisoners, fortifications
and territory, it has not a single instancegiven an inch of ground to the
enemy, nor has it lowered a flag of therepublic, nor surrendered a color or
a rifle to the enemy.It hascarried the banner of freedom to the oppressed
and suffering, and hasbeen greeted and received, not as ruthless conquerors,
but as liberatorsand defenders of the liberties and rights of mankind.Our
flag has beenhailed as the morning light.</p>

<p>After luncheon at the Cafe the guests repaired to the Indiangrounds,
where a special program had been arranged in honor of GeneralMiles.He had
been one of the great Indian fighters in the history ofthe country, and for
more than a quarter of a century had been stationedat outlying posts.It
was General Miles who captured Geronimo the famousApache chief, and
negotiated the terms of surrender.The meeting on theIndian grounds between
the General and this famous Indian was affecting. Geronimo clasped his arms
about the General and embraced himaffectionately.After this episode
General Miles pinned a Peace Jubileebadge on the breast of the Indian
warrior, and he expressed his thanks inbroken English.</p>

<p>After the sham battle then in progress was concluded, General Miles
and the Apache Chief held a long conference through an interpreter, nodoubt
reminding each other of stirring events in their lives, whenGeronimo lead
his tribe against the whites in many sanguinary contests.</p>

<p>CIVIL GOVERNMENT DAY.</p>

<p>October 14, 1898.</p>

<p>Great crowds still lingered at the Exposition, although the weather
had turned cold and disagreeable, and the Auditorium was well filled tohear
the interesting exercises which had been planned in celebration ofthis day. 
General William R. Shafter and staff had arrived too late toparticipate in
the celebration of Army and Navy Day and had thereforebeen invited to speak
on this occasion.His presence lent interest tothe event and thousands of
visitors filled the Auditorium to overflowingto see this famous warrior. 
When he appeared on the stage in uniform hewas greeted with a rousing cheer. 
The program of exercises was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg program">
<span class="l">Music. . Omaha Concert Band</span>
<span class="l">Invocation. . Rev. Newton M. Mann</span>
<span class="l">Address. . . . General Wm. R. Shafter</span>

<span class="l">Address. . . Senator John M. Thurston</span>
<span class="l">Music. . Star Spangled Banner, Omaha Concert Band.</span></span>

<p>General Shafter spoke as follows:</p>

<p>I regret that I am not able to express in fitting words my
appreciation of the reception that I have received at your hands.Forwhat
little I may have done I have been rewarded far beyond my wildestdreams.I
little thought that I should reach the highest rank when Imarched away
thirty-six years ago as a volunteer of infantry.Thehighest reward a
soldier can receive is the gratitude and appreciation ofhis countrymen, and
this I believe I now possess.Perhaps the mostappropriate things I can say
is to give you a short history of thecampaign in cuba that has ended with so
much honor to our arms.I wasordered to report at Washington and informed
that I should lead the firstexpedition from the United States.I was
ordered to Tampa with a view tomaking a reconnaissance in Cuba in force, but
this plan was subsequentlyabandoned and we remained there ready for whatever
service might bedemanded.Then we were ordered to go and assist the fleet
to capture theharbor and city of Santiago, and we embarked with an army of
17,000 men. We had absolutely no maps of Cuba, but I had with me a couple of
men whowere born at Santiago, and guided by information I received from them
Idetermined to land at the two points where I did.The result has
convinced me that my judgment was correct. No army has ever gone from
temperate zone to the tropics without disaster, and for this reason Iknew
that the campaign must be pushed as rapidly as lay in human powerand
endurance.Although I had the best army that ever marched under anAmerican
flag, the climate was something awful.You who have neverexperienced its
horrors can never realize them.I believed that we werestrong enough to
move on Santiago, andin three days I had landed theentire army.On June
25th we defeated the Spaniards in a sharpengagement.They had been
accustomed to fighting men who were poorly fedand inadequately armed and
they were astounded at the fighting qualitiesof our soldiers.It has been
said that troops in trenches armed withbreech-loading rifles could not be
successfully assailed, but we provedthe fallacy of that idea.</p>

<p>We then decided on the capture of El Caney and a division wasdetached
to make the charge.I thought that we could take it in twohours, but it
required from ten o'clock in the morning until 4:30 in theafternoon.The
Spaniards expected to be killed if they were captured, somost of them fought
until they were killed, and no prisoners were taken. We never advanced
beyond the position that we won in that fight.Theenemy came out the next
morning to make an attack, but it was fruitlessand only lasted an hour. 
Then the campaign was practically over.It wassimply necessary to convince
the Spanish commander that his case washopeless.He eventually surrendered,
and with our small army we hadcaptured 23,376 prisoners, 12,000 of whom were
beyond our reach.Why theSpaniards surrendered when they could have
abandoned their position andkept up the war I do not yet understand, but I
believe it was becausethey had been informed that the Spanish government had
decided to give upthe fight and surrender their soldiers in the eastern part
of the island.</p>

<p>The problem of that campaign was supplies.The fighting was theleast
part of it and the soonest over.There were times when the menwere short. 
You who were in the civil war remember that there were manytimes during that
conflict when we were short of rations, but then wecould always forage. But
in Cuba there was nothing to confiscate, and thearmy depended entirely on
the supplies that were forwarded with thegreatest difficulty over roads that
were at times impassable.While mostof the fighting in Cuba was done by the
regular army, the volunteers didall they were required to do, and they did
it like soldiers."</p>

<p>After the exercises the usual luncheon was served in the Cafe andthe
afternoon and evening was spent in witnessing the sham battle,fireworks and
other special attractions.</p>

<p>CHILDREN'S DAY.</p>

<p>October 15, 1898.</p>

<p>A low admission fee had been fixed for the children on this day and
they came in thousands form the city and surrounding country toparticipate
in the closing day of the Great Peace Jubilee.No formalexercises were held
but they sang patriotic songs with the accompanimentof Innes Band in the
afternoon on the Plaza, and spent the day as onlychildren can, in the
enjoyment of the many interesting amusements throughout the Midway, on the
lagoon and in the Exhibit Buildings.</p>

<p>Thus closed the most successful week in point of attendance and
interesting ceremonies of all the Exposition period.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>Sunday following Peace Jubilee Week brought a snow-storm with a high

<p>NEBRASKA DAY.</p>

<p>October 19, 1898.</p>

<p>Very low excursion rates from all parts of the state had been madeby
the railroads, and it was planned to make Nebraska Day the greatestday of
the Exposition, but on account of the bad weather the attendance,though very
large, was not as great as had been expected. The Governorand his staff,
the Nebraska State Commission, State Officers and otherofficials, were
escorted in carriages to the Exposition grounds. Theexercises were held in
the Auditorium at 11 o'clock A.M. The program was as follows:</p>

<p>UTAH DAY.</p>

<p>October 20, 1898.</p>

<p>The Governor of Utah, accompanied by his staff and many prominent
residents of that state came to celebrate their day at the Exposition. The
exercises were held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock A.M.The programwas as
follows:</p>

<span class="lg program">

<p>The exercises were of special interest on account of the presence of
the governor of the state, and the three presidents of the Mormon church.
The early reminiscence of some of these men who had nearly a half century
before spent a winter at Florence, Nebraska, and had followed BrighamYoung
across the then Great American Desert, were instructive, especiallycompared
with the present civilization which has grown up in the westduring the lives
of these men.</p>

<p>RAILROAD WEEK.</p>

<p>October 23 to 29, 1898.</p>

<p>The last week of the Exposition has been designated as railroad week
in order that the railroads might bring to the Exposition on lowexcursion
rates all those who had not yet seen its beauties.Theexcursion rates fixed
by all the railroads out from Omaha were extremelylow.For instance, the
Union Pacific railroad sold a $4.00 round tripticket from the western part
of the state to Omaha and return. The C.R.I. &amp; P. sold railroad tickets from points in Kansas and return at $2.00 and $2.50 where the regular fare one way was $6.00 and $7.00. Other railroads gave similar rates, and the effect of these low rates wasto bring to the exposition great crowds during the last week of itshistory.</p>

<p>On October 20th, a special train bearingPresident Frank Thompson,
the board of directors, and many of the officials of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, arrived.By special invitation, the officers of the exposition
and executive committee, were invited to lunch with the Pennsylvania
officials in their private dining-car.A number of railroad officialsliving
in Omaha were also invited.The dinner served was one of the mostpleasant
informal affairs during the exposition.</p>

<p>On Sunday, October 23rd, the German Parade, which had been postponed
on German Day, on account of the inclement weather, was given.Thisparade
formed in the vicinity of Germania Hall and marched to theExposition
grounds.Numerous bands, elaborately decorated floats, and along line of
carriages with distinguished German guests marched throughthe principal
streets of the city.At the exposition grounds the day wasspent by the
participants without formal exercises.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 22, was especially set aside for the children who
were admitted free on that day.Excursions from many parts of the state
brought in thousands of the little ones and the return of sunshine afterthe
inclement weather of the week past, made the day a most enjoyableone, and
largely increased the attendance of the exposition, no less than13,594
children having been admitted free.</p>

<p>OMAHA DAY.</p>

<p>October 31, 1898.</p>

<p>It having been decided that the gates of the exposition would closeon
October 31st, this day was designated as Omaha Day, and every effortwas used
to make it one of the banner days of the exposition.MayorMoores issued a
proclamation reciting the many benefits that Omaha hasreceived from the
exposition praising its management, and declaring Omahaday an official
holiday.He urged all places of business to close andevery citizen of the
city to attend the exposition on that day.TheBoard of Education ordered
the schools close.The Commercial Club andLabor Organizations urged the
universal celebration of this holiday andevery citizen of Omaha seemed to
take on himself the responsibility ofworking for the success of this day. 
Proprietors of many of the largestores distributed tickets of admission
among their employes.Charitablecitizens distributed hundreds of tickets to
the poor of the city throughthe assistance of the Associated Charities.</p>

<p>The last day of the Exposition, like the first, was one of bright
sunshine.The exercises of the day were planned to take place in the
Auditorium at 3 o'clock P.M. and immediately after the band concert.The
program was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg program">
<span class="l">Music. . Innes Band</span>
<span class="l">Innovation. . Rev. T.J. Mackay</span>

<span class="l">Address. . . President Wattles</span>
<span class="l">Music. . Innes Band</span></span>

<p>Mayor Moores spoke as follows:</p>

<p>It is fitting that the closing day of the TransmississippiExposition
should be set aside as Omaha Day, for from its inception thisgreat
enterprise has been dependent upon the energy, sagacity andbenevolence of
the citizens of Omaha.</p>

<p>Omaha farsightedness planned this exposition when the leaden skiesof
adversity hung heavy over the land; Omaha courage inspired the
Transmississippi region with faith in the future and secured promises of
co-operation and assistance from the western cities and states, when
financial panic and business depression were trying the stoutest hearts;
Omaha liberality and generosity furnished the vast amount of moneyrequired
to secure the successful completion of the exposition plans;Omaha
intelligence and energy have directed and managed the enterprise;and now
most properly to Omaha has been accorded the honor of closing the exposition. I trust that when the turnstiles cease clicking tonight they will have registered the largest daily attendance ever seen upon thesegrounds.</p>

<p>This exposition has been a benefit to Omaha in many ways.It has
inspired Omaha people with faith in themselves and in their city.It has
shown our citizens that no enterprise is too large for them to undertakeand
carry to successful completion if they work together and give ittheir united
loyal support.It has made Omaha people proud of their cityand they have
formed the habit of doing their part to make the city neat,clean and
attractive and of saying the best things about Omaha instead oftalking to
friends and visitors about the failings of the city.In factmany of our
most hopeless old fogies have become so accustomed to hearingother people
say good things about Omaha that they sometimes findthemselves praising the
city.Then again the hundreds of persons whohave visited our city have gone
to their homes in various parts of thecountry singing the praises of Omaha
hospitality, liberality, pluck,push, energy and thrift, and hundreds of
business men and manufacturersare now looking toward Omaha for the purpose
of locating newestablishments here.My prediction is that during the next
ten yearsOmaha will experience a larger proportion of growth than any other
cityin the country and that the close of the decade will see here a
population of 250,000 to 3000,000 with a commensurate increase inbusiness in
all lines.</p>

<p>The country at large believe in Omaha and visitors have not beenslow
to voice their approval.That distinguished statesman and diplomat,
ex-Governor Crittendon of Missouri, in an address here on Kansas City day
said:"The record Omaha has made in erecting this exposition ismarvelous. 
Kansas City could not have done it; St. Louis could not havedone it; in fact
no other western city could have accomplished the task. Such an enterprise
required a complete unity and splendid liberality andpublic spirit which no
other city I believe possesses."</p>

<p>Such words from such a source should fill our citizens with greater
pride in their city.</p>

<p>I feel that at this time I should poorly represent the people ofOmaha
if I should close these remarks without expressing to the directorsand
especially to the officers and board of managers of the expositionthe
gratitude of their fellow citizens for their devoted unselfish laborswhich
have brought the exposition to this splendid culmination.Theyhave
succeeded far beyond our fondest dreams.I wish to thank them inbehalf of
the citizens of Omaha for what they have accomplished here andfor the good
they have done the city.</p>

<p>And now fellow citizens as the exposition closes let us look forward
to the future with faith and courage and let us one and all put ourshoulders
to the wheel of Omaha prosperity and progress.The future ofGreater Omaha
is in your hands.</p>

<p>Manager Lindsey spoke as follows:</p>

<p>Away back in the good old times which we have all heard about andsome
of us have seen, there used to be an occasion at the close of thedistrict
school called the "last day."It was a gala day, as it meantfreedom from 
lessons and restraint and because it ushered in a longlooked for holiday.</p>

<p>and international Exposition, our tasks are almost ended, and our holiday near
at hand.We have all seen the Midway some wonderful and beautiful illusions,
and have been mystified by many marvelous feats of magic, but the greatest
marvel of all have been the exposition itself.To transfer an irregular
cornfield into a fairy land, with magnificent buildings, stately domes,
graceful colonnades, beautiful flower gardens, tracery of brilliant light-- to
do all this in less than two years does indeed seem a feat worthy of Aladdin
and his lamp.</p>

<p>Unlike our friends on the Midway, I am going to tell you how this marvel was
done.First of all it did not come by chance or by inheritance.Some would
have you believe it was a streak of luck, that good fortune like a pillar of
cloud preceded us by day and hovered like a Providence aided us with clear
skies, pleasant weather and bountiful harvests, still I must repudiate the good
luck theory, and attribute the stupendous success of the exposition to the
common sense, every day business ideas, to the sleepless nights, and the
persistent hard work of the members of the executive committee.</p>

<p>Social pleasures, personal comfort and individual business requirements have
all been brushed aside, and no obstacle has been allowed to interfere with the
successful outcome of our aim- an exposition worthy of its name and the great
territory it represents.</p>

<p>Continuing, Mr. Lindsey briefly reviewed the work of securing the funds with
which to promote such a colossal enterprise and expressed his grateful
acknowledgment of the confidence that the people had reposed in the management
of the exposition.He also paid a tribute to the men on whom they had called
for advice and encouragement in times of discouragement, and trial and
expressed the thanks of the management to every one who had contributed to make
the exposition what it is.In conclusion, he said that while there had been
much hard work in the building of the exposition, there was also much that was
pleasant, and if, in the stress and worry consequent upon so vast an
undertaking there had arisen any unpleasant memories he asked that they be
consigned to rest and that the people should remember that what had been done
had been done for the glory of Omaha, of Nebraska, and of the transmississippi
region.</p>

<div class="chapter doublespace ">

<p>Mr. Rosewater said that the birth of most great men creates no
ripple of excitement except in the midst of their own family and friends.So
some of the most momentous epochs in the history of the world have been ushered
in without attracting the attention of the world at large.It had come under
his personal observation that even when the proclamation of emancipation was
issued by President Lincoln it excited no visible demonstration in the city
where it was promulgated. This was also true of the Transmississippi
Exposition.The inception of the enterprise had attracted but little attention
in this community.Even those who participated in its birth did not realize
what tall oaks from little acorns grew.Three months after Omaha was selected
as the site of the exposition scarcely forty men met at the Commercial club to
start the subscription list.The first man wanted to head the list for $100,
but over $10,000 was finally subscribed.Even when we went before congress for
a $300,000 appropriation only $1,250 had been paid in.</p>

<p>"It was the greatest piece of adamantine gall I ever saw," continued the
speaker, "but we succeeded, not only in getting the original appropriation, but
$40,000 additional for the organization and maintenance of the Indian congress. 
It was not luck that brought this about, but hard labor.While very few of our
people realize and many never will realize what has been done, they can see the
results since 2,600,000 people have passed through our gates.Even some of our
best business men refused to co-operate in the enterprise and freely predicted
calamity and disaster.Only five states legislatures made appropriations, but
we have twenty state creditably represented on the grounds through private
subscriptions."</p>

<p>In this connection Mr. Rosewater called attention to some of the municipal
jealousies that had handicapped the management in securing outside co-operation
in the early days of the enterprise and related one or two humorous incidents
that effectively illustrated the difficulties that had been encountered.</p>

<p>Speaking of the work of his own department Mr. Rosewater said that the labors
of the Department of Publicity had extended from Massachusetts to Oregon and
Washington.They had involved daily and nightly attention and the
correspondence that had been carried on would fill many volumes."But", he
concluded, "I will not weary you with telling what we have done.Here we have
the result, the most marvelous achievement that the pioneers of the west have
ever undertaken and accomplished.We have found that what Omaha undertakes to
do she will complete and that Omaha can do as much as any other city to develop
the resources of the west.Chicago received money enough from the general
government to build ten expositions.Even then they had to postpone it a year,
while in spite of the war and in spite of the circumstances we opened our
exposition promptly on time and we will close it tonight with all the glory
than any one can wish."</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>Within a few hours the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition will have
passed into history.It is proper on this occasion to review briefly the
progress of this enterprise, and while the work of its promoters and the
results of their labors are more or less familiar to all the inhabitants of
this community, the efficient services rendered by a few of our citizens
without compensation for the public good, can only be fully appreciated when
the grand results attained and their importance to this city and the West are
fully understood.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1895, when this Exposition was first proposed, the business
interests of this community were at their lowest ebb.To arouse the people of
this city and of the West from the stupor of discouragement and depression
which pervaded all our business interests and to enlist their financial aid and
cooperation in a great Exposition of the resources of the West, was a
stupendous undertaking.No one can appreciate the discouragements encountered
except those who were actively engaged in the work.</p>

<p>On Jan. 8th, 1898, the corporation was organized and a board of eleven
directors elected.For nearly a year these directors met weekly, and much of
the most important preliminary work was accomplished.Resolutions from
commercial bodies, cities and states favoring the Exposition and requesting
national recognition and federal appropriation were secured in large numbers. 
Preliminary appropriations by the states of Iowa and Louisiana were made, and
finally through the efficient efforts of our representatives in congress,
government recognition was secured, pledging an appropriation of $200,000. for
a federal building and an exhibit.</p>

<p>This achievement was the turning point in the history of the enterprise and
settled in the minds of many who had been doubters before, that the Exposition
would be a reality.Soliciting committees were organized and more than
$350,000. of stock subscriptions and donations were secured.</p>

<p>In deference to the wishes of the new contributors, the articles of association
were amended and an enlarged board of fifty directors was elected on Dec. 1st,
1896.The work was then divided into seven departments, two of which were
afterwards consolidated.The managers of these departments constitute the
Executive Committee.For some months after this organization was perfected the
Executive Committee met twice a week, but for more than a year past this
committee has held daily sessions, and its members have devoted their valuable
time and business experience without compensation to the enormous details of
the organization.The magnitude of the business done by this committee cannot
be appreciated by those not familiar with the details of the management of
great enterprises of this character.</p>

<p>The sessions of the committee have not always been harmonious, but differences
have been adjusted, and in nearly every instance measures have passed by
unanimous vote.The splendid business management of this Exposition is largely
due to the careful attention to all important matters by the entire committee. 
Every dollar of the funds of the Exposition has been expended under authority
voted by this committee, and while the plan of organization has been criticized
by some, the results attained speak volumes in its praise.No single
individual could have given the attention to the affairs of the enterprise that
they have received by the department managers.</p>

<p>Something of the details of the Ways and Means, Publicity and Promotion and
Transportation Departments has been given by their respective managers who have
already addressed you today.Of the work done by the other departments I shall
speak briefly.</p>

<p>One of the greatest achievements of this Exposition has been the beauty and
convenience of the grounds and buildings.The manager of this department
brought into practical service his successful business training, and to his
capacity for details much of the success of his department is due.He knew no
business hours, but at all times both day and night for weeks and months he
devoted himself to the work at hand.One of the first recommendations made by
this department was the change of location from Miller Park to the present
site.The wisdom of this change is conceded by all.To the convenience and
accessibility of the present locations much of the beauty of the Exposition and
its financial success is due.</p>

<p>In the selection of the great artists who architecture, landscaping and
electrical effects have been the admiration of all visitors the manager of this
department displayed great wisdom.It is conceded by all that to the
architects-in-chief we are indebted for more words of praise of our Exposition
than to any other source.Their beautiful groupings and splendid designs of
buildings and grounds have won for them a world-wide and lasting fame.The
work of all the other architects who planned the buildings was of the highest
order, and each design is a masterpiece.The landscape-gardening has been a
surprise and pleasure to all.The trees, the flowers and even the grass seemed
to grow under the supervision of the architect as by magic.The arrangement of
the vines and plants, the walks and drives, have made the grounds a veritable
garden of beauty.No words of praise can repay the pleasure that this great
artist has given to hundreds of thousands who have admired his beautiful
design.</p>

<p>One of the crowning features of this Exposition, and one which has excelled all
other expositions in the world's history, has been its electrical effects.To
the designer and his able assistant, the Superintendent of Electricity, the
Exposition is indebted for the wonderment and surprise expressed by all who
have witnessed the magnificent spectacle of the Grand Court at night.The
buildings and exhibits will fade in memory, but who can ever forget the
inspirations and impressions produced by the illuminations which at night
glorified each turret, spire and dome.</p>

<p>But the work of these great men would have gone for naught but for the careful
attention and business sagacity displayed in minor details.Leases from
hundreds of owners of these grounds were secured, contracts for buildings and
improvements were made, and only those who witnessed the chaos that existed
here as late as April 1897, can appreciate the magnitude of the work
accomplished by this department.The first ground was broken April 27th, 1897,
a little more than a year before the gates were opened to an admiring world. 
The contract for the first building was awarded on July 19th, 1897, but between
that time and the completion of construction no less than 110 buildings and
structures large and small were erected by this department at a total cost of
$565,034., and the total expenditure up to date by this department has been
$1,053,064.34.</p>

<p>A fire and police department was organized, which, under the able direction of
our city chief, has saved from destruction this beautiful white city on several
occasions.A medical department was provided which has served no less than
1,973 patients during the Exposition.A sanitary department was established
whose efficient service has been attested by the cleanliness of the grounds and
buildings.But I must not dwell longer on the work of this important
department and the efficient services rendered by its manager and his
assistants.</p>

<p>The Exhibit Department had a stupendous responsibility to gather from the
states of the west and all parts of the world the products of soil and mine and
factory to fill these beautiful buildings when completed.The manager of this
department had many obstacles to overcome, as it was early decided that owing
to the necessity of financial aid a space charge from all exhibits would be
made.But for the tact and ability of the manager and his able superintendent,
the splendid financial showing of the Exposition could not be made today.No
less than $190,716 has been collected and conveyed to the treasury for exhibit
space by this department.Something of the magnitude of the work performed can
be conceived when I say that 4,062 separate exhibits were made and forty states
and ten foreign countries were represented.</p>

<p>To gather these exhibits and install them to the satisfaction of all interested
parties was a task which could not have been performed by any one of less
ability than the able manager of this department.In many instances these
exhibits have excelled all others at previous expositions.The livestock show
was conceded by all to be the finest collection of animals ever exhibited. 
There were 2,692 entries, while at the World's Fair there were but 1,842.The
agricultural exhibit is pronounced the best that has ever been made, while the
mineral exhibit excels any other of the mineral products of the territory
represented.The government exhibit here is also the best this Nation has ever
displayed, and it has been admired and praised by all.</p>

<p>The space at the disposal of this department did not permit of exhibits that
would compare in magnitude and number to the World's Fair at Chicago, but in
point of excellence, variety and careful selection, the exhibits of this
Exposition have never been excelled.The enormous details in the allotment of
space, the adjustment of conflicting interests, the selections of juries of
award, and in gathering from the Art Galleries of the world the choice
specimens which make up the splendid exhibit of the Fine Arts Building, has
engaged the time, energy and ability of the able manager of this department.</p>

<p>The Manager of the Concessions Department has performed duties with single
ability, tact and discretion.He has had to deal with a class of professional
showmen, who have ever been on the alert to secure all the advantages possible
for the least compensation they could induce him to accept.Many difficulties
and vexatious problems have arisen which have taxed his splendid business
ability to the utmost.No higher praise could be given to any man than is
accorded to him in the acknowledged fact that in every instance he has
protected the interests of the Exposition in exacting from concessionaires the
full value of the privilege granted, and has collected from them nearly every
dollar they agreed to pay.Both he and his worthy superintendent have ever
been on the alert to protect the interests of the Exposition, and the
efficiency of the work of this department is shown by the financial results
attained.No less than $276,112. has been received from concessions, which
compared with like receipts from other expositions proves that fewer mistakes
have been made and better results attained than at any other Exposition ever
held in this country.245 concessions were awarded by this department, and the
Midway at this Exposition has excelled the amusement features of all other
smaller expositions and has almost been equal in point of excellence to that of
the great World's Fair.The orderly manner in which concessions have been
conducted, the small number of cases of litigation and the general satisfaction
to the public this feature of our Exposition has given, commends the wisdom in
the selection of the manager who has attained these results.</p>

<p>Serious problems of finance have engaged the ability and ingenuity of the Ways
and Means Department.Under this department the general finances of the
Exposition have been conducted.I cannot pass this opportunity to express
appreciation of the most valuable services of the General Secretary.While he
has received a moderate salary for his services, he has known no hours of
recreation or rest.On many occasions I have found him at work at midnight,
and to his great watchfulness on all occasions is due much of our success.The
manager of this department has organized and conducted the Bureau of Gates and
Admissions, the Bureau of Music and Special Attractions, and to his efficient
work the public is indebted for many of the high class musical and spectacular
features which have been an important element in the entertainment of all.</p>

<p>The manager of the Publicity and Promotion Department has detailed in his
address the enormous work accomplished in advertising the Exposition and
promoting all of its departments throughout the country.While the war
seriously impeded the work of this department for a time, no one well informed
denies that Omaha and the Exposition are now known throughout the entire
Nation.</p>

<p>To the Transportation Department we are indebted for the low rates secured for
exhibits and excursions.Its manager, by his experience in transportation
affairs, has always been able to properly present the wishes of the Exposition
to the railway officials, on whose generosity we from the start relied for much
of our patronage, and while the rates secured have not always been
satisfactory, I doubt if the results could have been as great in the hands of a
less experienced and able man.</p>

<p>To one and all of these managers who have served from the beginning without
compensation, this community owes a debt which can never be paid, and while it
is usual for the credit of a great battle to be given to the general of the
war, in many instances, as with this Exposition, this credit is equally due to
the efficient services of his assistants and to the common soldiers, which
includes nearly every representative citizen in this community, for all have
worked with one purpose to build up this enterprise and bring to it the large
measure of success it has attained.This Exposition has been an object lesson
of great value to this community.It has illustrated what can be accomplished
by standing together as one man in all matters of common interest.Too much
time and energy has been spent in the past in seeking to destroy the influence
of men who were willing to work for the public good, and the result of this
great achievement should bring into closer union the business men of this city
in the upbuilding of what in the next few years must be one of the great
commercial centers of the world.</p>

<p>An important work has been done by the women of this state in the Bureau of
Education.No less than 64 meetings, many of them of national importance, have
been held here under the auspices of their organization.Men and women of
world-wide reputation have been brought here to discuss the great social,
political, economic and religious topics of the day, and future history will
record many of the able discussions on these subjects.The Bureau of
Entertainment was well conducted by the ladies of this city and has been a
feature of the Exposition that has pleased thousands of visitors who have
partaken of the hospitality of the well-ordered rooms provided for its
functions.</p>

<p>But I cannot enumerate the faithful services of all those deserving praise for
their work.</p>

<p>When the Exposition was completed and our gates were opened, special days and
special programs were found necessary to interest all classes.No less than
143 special days were arranged, all of greater or less importance, each one
bringing its quota of visitors who might not have come but for the special
features of their day.Public ceremonies bringing into service many of the
best orators of the land were arranged.The culminating event of the year, the
"Peace Jubilee" week, alone witnessed six successful celebrations in which the
most distinguished men of the Nation participated.It has been my humble duty
since the opening of the Exposition to arrange these special days, to meet and
entertain the thousands of prominent guests who have been present and to
satisfy, as well as my abilities would permit, the exacting requirements of
visitors and of the thousands connected in every capacity with the affairs of
the Exposition.In these duties I have been assisted by the General Manager,
who by his special fitness for the work has made many friends for the
Exposition.</p>

<p>In my work I claim no special credit.As a citizen of this community I have
simply discharged my duty.From the start I saw a great opportunity to promote
the welfare of all the people of this city and the entire west.My every
expectation has been realized, and I shall retire from the office, with which
the stockholders and directors of this Exposition have honored me, with the
consciousness that my every act has been inspired by pure motives, and that my
best efforts have been given at all times during evil and good report for the
success of the enterprise and for the greatest good that could be brought out
of it for the community, the state and the country it has advertised in a
manner as never before to the world.</p>

<p>To this city this Exposition has been like a rain in a drouth.It has put new
life and energy in all our business interests, in the clearings of our banks,
in the business of our merchants; to the values of our real estate, to the
fabrics of our factories, it has brought a new and life-giving influence.Our
people have forgotten the evils of panic and depression in the enjoyment of the
beauties and pleasures so abundant on these grounds.To the state and to the
entire West it has given a new standing among the people of the East and far
away countries, which will influence immigration and investment in all future
years.The greatest benefits are still to come, when visitors from less
favored climes have time to think of, and publish the good impressions they
have received of the country represented here.The future historians of the
West will record great impetus given in the development of all departments of
its industries by this Exposition. </p>

<p>We celebrate today its closing scene.The Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition can never be repeated, and while I bid Godspeed to any new company
of enterprising men who under some other name or title may bring new features
here next year.I sincerely hope that the lustre of our assured success will
not be dimmed by any less important and successful subsequent event.</p>

<p>But I must pass on and speak of the financial condition of this corporation in
which more than 6,500 of our enterprising citizens are interested.No
subscriber or donor, large or small, expected to receive back much if any, of
his contribution in dollars and cents.The money necessary to promote this
enterprise was largely subscribed by residents or corporations directly
interested in Omaha.It was given from the purses of the poor as well as the
rich, and when once placed in the treasury of this corporation it became to me
a sacred fund, and in its use the members of the Executive Committee have
guarded it with jealous care.Since it became evident that a surplus would be
left after the gates were finally closed, numerous propositions have been made
and various agencies and individuals have endeavored to divert this surplus to
other public enterprises, foreign to the objects of the corporation to which it
belongs.A horde of clamoring claimants seek to divide the spoils, but to one
and all a deaf ear has been turned, and whatever is left after the debts and
obligations are discharged, will be sacredly returned to the men and women who
contributed to the enterprise in its time of need.</p>

<p>To me, and I am sure to each member of the Executive Committee, it will be the
proudest moment in our lives when we can pay back, as we hope to do, every
dollar subscribed to the stock of this Exposition.No fears need be
entertained by those who have entrusted us with this sacred fund, that it will
not be honestly handled in the future as it has been in the past.Not one
dollar can be donated to the men whose efforts could not be compensated with
money, and who have guarded the interests of this Exposition since its
conception.Not one dollar will be diverted to any other purpose foreign to
this organization.I favor the publication of a true history of this great
achievement, and have appointed a committee of honorable men, whose capacity
and integrity cannot be questioned, to prepare and publish this proud record,
which is not the achievement of any individual or set of men, but is the
culmination of the efforts and sacrifices, and of the energy and enterprise of
all who have participated in its conception or triumphal progress.But the
publication of this history may not eventually cost the Exposition a dollar. 
The first edition of the history of the Tennessee Centennial, a respectable
volume of 500 pages, cost $4,000. and was sold in advance of publication at a
profit of $1,000.A fund has been set aside for the payment of a history of
this Exposition, but this money will not be wasted, and in my opinion the
larger part will be returned to the treasury when the work has been published
and sold.</p>

<p>I have carefully compiled a statement of the present financial condition of this corporation, but bare figures are generally uninteresting, and I will summarize as follows:</p>

<p>The total amount of stock subscriptions collected and 
paid into the treasury on Oct. 28th was................... $291,909.04</p>
<p>The total donations collected on that day was.............163,070.20</p>
<p>The total earnings of the corporation to that date was....1,306,384.94</p>
<p>Making the grand total of cash receipts from all 
sources of...............................................$1,761,364.18</p>
<p>Of this sum there remained in the hands of the Secretary and
treasurer on Oct. 28th,................................... $360,496.48</p>
<p>Add to this amount the known and estimated 
earnings and collections since,...........................53,000.</p>
<p>The good notes and accounts due, not including
unpaid stock subscriptions,............................... 7,500.</p>
<p>Would make available at close of business tonight, $420,996.48</p>
<p>Deduct from this, contract balances still due.............$21,985.02</p>
<p>Estimated monthly and weekly pay rolls due Nov. 1st. .....23,000.</p>
<p>Estimated unpaid bills &amp; accounts.........................20,000.</p>
<p>$64,985.02</p>
<p>Would still leave available............................... $956,011.46</p>

<p>I estimate that the salvage and earnings from gates and concessions will pay expenses of cleaning the grounds and closing the business after Nov. 1st.</p>

<p>It is estimated that of the $291,909.04 paid on account of stock subscriptions,
$20,000. represents partial payments, leaving at this date about $271,909.04
paid up stock.What will be done for those stock subscribers who have not paid
up in full is a matter for future determination.In any event the collectible
subscriptions will more than pay any sum that may be found due them.</p>

<p>Deducting estimated paid up stock.........................$271.909.04</p>
<p>from available assets would leave for
contingent liabilities,...................................84,102.42</p>

<p>which it would seem was sufficient to cover all possible claims of every
character.</p>

<p>If these estimates are correct, it will be seen that we will be able to pay our
stockholders in full, and this is what we hope to do.But in order to protect
the corporation from all possible liabilities, I shall recommend to the
directors that an immediate dividend of fifty percent be declared and paid
without delay to the stockholders of record on this day.</p>

<p>I trust this showing may be as satisfactory to the stockholders and patrons of
this Exposition as it is to those who have been entrusted with its management.</p>

<p>I desire to express my sincere appreciation of the hearty cooperation I have
received from the private citizens of this community, from all who have
participated in the Exposition from other states, and especially from the board
of fifty directors who have honored and assisted me in a manner unusual in
public enterprises.By this cooperation and by the efficient services of the
managers of the departments a grand result has been achieved, which will stand
out in the history of the West as the crowning feature in its fifty years of
growth and development."</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>After the exercises a banquet was served in the Cafe to the officers of the
Exposition, city and county officials, members of the board of education, the
executive committee of the Commercial Club, the board of governors of the
Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, and many other prominent citizens of Omaha who had one
and all lent their aid to the now assured success of the Exposition.Many
toasts were responded to by the guests of the officers of the Exposition.Many
words of praise were spoken of their efforts and many regrets were expressed
that the beautiful White City with all its enchantment was so soon to be a
thing of the past.</p>

<p>In the evening grand spectacular fireworks were witnessed by many thousands,
after which a Grand Carnival on the streets of the Midway was held, and not
until 12 o'clock, when the lights for the last time went out on the
Transmississippi and International Exposition, did the crowds disperse.</p>

<p>DAILY PROGRAMMES.</p>

<p>Besides the formal exercises on special days, the programs of which have been
given in the preceding pages, each day had its special attractions.Bulletins
were posted at conspicuous places on the grounds each morning announcing these
special features and the daily papers also published them.These attractions
were usually given in the afternoon and evening and consisted of Band Concerts
in the Plaza, Life-Saving Service Practice, on the Lagoon, Indian Sham Battles
and Dances, Ascensions of the War Balloons and Grand Fireworks in the evening. 
All of these special features of the Exposition were much enjoyed and
appreciated.The excellent bands of national reputation employed by the
musical department were a source of continual delight and did much to hold the
interest of the people of Omaha in the Exposition after they had thoroughly
seen the exhibits and become tired of the Midway.</p>

<p>There were many celebrations which have not been mentioned but which were given
the dignity of Special days.In all one hundred and forty-three Special Days
were designated and that there is no doubt that these and other special
features added many thousands to the attendance and were a source of much
pleasure and interest to the visitors.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF EDUCATION.</p>

<p>The Educational Features of the Exposition were entrusted to a bureau of
education organized by the Exhibits Department among the women of the state of
Nebraska.In all sixty-four meetings of congresses and other educational
gatherings were held in the churches of Omaha and on the Exposition Grounds. 
Some of these meetings were of almost national interest and many noted men and
women of the country were brought to Omaha and the Exposition on account of the
work of this bureau of education.</p>

<p>GENERAL MANAGER.</p>

<p>Major Thaddeau S. Clarkson was first appointed assistant to the president and
afterwards was elected General Manager.His principal duties consisted of
arranging the details of the daily programs and in assisting in the
entertainment of distinguished guests.These duties were performed with single
ability and tact.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF ENTERTAINMENT.</p>

<p>By Mrs. Clement Chase.</p>

<p>The plans for the entertainment of guests of honor at the Transmississippi
Exposition, were most carefully considered.To assist in this work it was
decided to organize a Bureau of Entertainment, consisting entirely of ladies. 
In this the president of the exposition was influencedsomewhat by the success
achieved by the management of the Columbian Exposition along these lines, and
was guided also, by what had been observed more recently at the Nashville
Exposition, where the idea had been carried still further by the appointment of
a lady president with a large committee to assist, made up of ladies chosen
from the most influential families of Tennessee.it had been found that by
means of sub-committees, chosen as occasion might require, arrangements could
be speedily made at any moment for the entertainment of small parties of
visitors to whom hospitality should be shown; and when larger groups or very
distinguished guests were expected the entire committee could be summoned to do
the honors.</p>

<p>At Omaha the Bureau of Entertainment was composed of fifty ladies, headed by an Executive Committee of ten, as follows:</p>

<p>Rooms were arranged for the use of the Bureau of Entertainment in the gallery
of the Mines &amp; Mining Building.Draperies of cool green, mattings and wicker
furniture gave a delightful air of comfort to these apartments, which were much
sought by those who wished to pass a restful quarter of an hour.The rooms
were found to be convenient for all but the largest receptions.As a rule the
luncheons were given at the official cafe, though on several occasions light
refreshments were served here.</p>

<p>The ladies of the Bureau of Entertainment organized and carried out the flower
parade, which was noted as one of the most beautiful features of the Exposition
summer; and they also arranged the masked carnival that was held on the
pavement of the Grand Court surrounding the Lagoon.The series of
entertainments so energetically forwarded by this committee, culminated upon
the arrival of President McKinley accompanied by several of his cabinet and
distinguished members of the Diplomatic Corps.Mrs. McKinley was expected and
a luncheon had been arranged in her honor at the Omaha Club.She was prevented
at the last moment, from coming, much to the regret of all.The luncheon was
therefore given to the ladies of the Diplomatic Corps and the wives of the
Cabinet Officers.Mme. Wu Ting Fang, wife of the Chinese Minister and Mme.
Wing Pom Ye, wife of the Corean Minister, occupied the seats of honor.it was
the most elaborate and one of the most brilliant entertainments of the summer.</p>

<p>This department made a most favorable impression upon the guests of the
Exposition, particularly upon those from the East, who were very appreciative
of the steps taken to make their visits pleasant.The governors of nearly all
the western states and their staffs, together with their ladies, were shown
attention upon their visits; and in many ways the Bureau of Entertainment was
found to fit in admirably with the executive machinery of the Exposition.</p>

<p>LEGAL AFFAIRS OF THE EXPOSITION.</p>

<p>Carroll S. Montgomery, General Counsel.</p>

<p>The work of the General Counsel in this connection began with the preparation
of the Articles of Incorporation before the Exposition was organized in
December 1895, and continued through the whole period from that time until and
including the last meeting of the Board of Directors held June 30, 1902, at
which, by appropriate resolutions prepared and presented by the General
Counsel, copies hereinbefore, the affairs and business of the corporation were
declared fully consummated and performed and further business by or in the name
of the corporation was discontinued.</p>

<p>After the completion of the organization and during the EXPLOITATION period of
the Exposition, aside from regular attendance upon the meetings of the Board of
Directors of which the General Counsel was a member, the services performed
consisted chiefly in oral counsel to the Board and to the officers.In
addition to this were the preparation or approval of various documents such as
resolutions, official communications, records of meetings, subscription
contracts and the like.</p>

<p>Similar services were performed in the matters of the REORGANIZATION and of
locating the Exposition.</p>

<p>Beginning with December 16, 1896, when the general operations under the Board
of Directors commenced, the legal affairs became more extensive and
complicated, occupying a very large portion of the attention and time of the
General Counsel and also of others whose assistance from time to time was
procured.No step was taken, involving legal questions, either by the Board of
Directors, the Executive Committee or the officers, without advice either oral
or written.The form and general substance of all contracts which were used in
every department were determined upon under the advice of the General Counsel. 
Such contracts in writing during the period of the Exposition aggregatedin
number 406, of which 159 were general contracts and 247 were concession
contracts.The majority of these contracts were actually read and approved in
writing by the General Counsel.Aside form daily oral counsel, a large number
of written opinions were given by letter or otherwise.During the actual
progress of the Exposition, such written counsel was of almost daily
occurrence.</p>

<p>All of this time and service from the beginning to the end was rendered by the
general Counsel without compensation and in complete accord with his associate
officers and Directors who in like manner so freely contributed their time and
services to the enterprise, for the success of which they pledged themselves.</p>

<p>Among the transactions involving legal attention was the matter of the bonds
voted by Douglas County in aid of the Exhibit of the County at the Exposition. 
After these bonds had been voted, their validity was questioned.Proceedings
were instituted and conducted to a successful conclusion in the Supreme Court
of Nebraska whereby these bonds were adjudged legal and the proceeds thereof
devoted to the purpose intended.In February and April 1898, when it appeared
doubtful about the Exposition realizing sufficient funds for the payment of its
obligations, the Board of Directors ordered the prosecution of actions against
delinquent subscribers for the collection of their unpaid subscriptions. A
large number of these actions were commenced, but, before that period was
reached in their prosecution when the collection of judgments might be
enforced, the financial success of the Exposition had become assured and it
became certain that not only all expenses would be paid but also that a portion
of the subscriptions of the stockholders would be returned.Thereupon by order
of the Board of Directors, these proceedings were ordered discontinued and
accordingly the cases were dismissed, the costs and expenses paid and the
business terminated.</p>

<p>Aside from these actions against the delinquent subscribers, there were
commenced and prosecuted either to settlement or to final judgment 34 cases in
which the Exposition was involved.These cases were distributed among, and
arose out of the business of, the various departments in the following
proportion:Publicity and Promotion, 1; Buildings and Grounds, 12; Exhibits,
3; Concessions and Privileges 16; Transportation, 2.</p>

<p>In six of the 34 cases the Exposition was plaintiff.In the others the
Exposition was a defendant.In 22 of the cases against the Exposition, money
demands were asserted aggregating $234,150.79.Of these cases, five were for
alleged personal injuries in which the aggregate sum claimed was $106,304.60. 
All of these cases were finally disposed of, the last one terminating in May,
1902.The total expense to the Exposition on account of the litigation
represented in these cases, was $32,157.16 of which $24,815.02 was paid in
settlement of the various claims, $3,960.44 was paid for costs and expenses and
$3,381.70 for legal fees.</p>

<p>Considering the character, scope and magnitude of the Exposition enterprise,
the length of time occupied from the organization of the corporation to its
end, it is apparent without controversy that its litigation was remarkably
limited and that the results thereof were especially favorable.It is
submitted that in this, as in all other respects, no parallel can be found in
the history of other Expositions.</p>

<p>All the work and proceedings touching the legal affairs of the Exposition were
conducted and had with full knowledge, and approval in all respects, of the
officers particularly interested, and of the Executive Committee.The General
Counsel was at all times at hand responding cheerfully and promptly to all
demands upon his time and attention and for his services.From the beginning
he was sanguine and insisted that the ultimate result would be a great success
and to that end in harmony with the other officers and Directors, he worked
enthusiastically, courageously, energetically, and to his efforts and labor
should be credited no small share of the successful results attained.</p>

<p>THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT EXHIBIT.</p>

<p>The exhibits from the various Departments of National Government, housed in the
beautiful building at the west end of the Grand Court, were objects of more
than usual interest and concern, and from the educational and instructive
points of view, were of greatest value in securing permanent results in the
broadening and uplifting of the minds of exposition patrons.This building was
constantly thronged with the studious, old and young, and the scholars from the
schools, showing the greatest interest in the exhibits, curious to learn all
about the functions of government in War and Peace, were generously and
intelligently assisted by the officials in charge of the various exhibits. 
Nothing more clearly shows the value, to all of our people, of such exhibits of
Governmental operations and methods, than the general interest shown by the
young people of our schools in all the various exhibits, placed and shown in
this great building.The effects of such careful study and instruction are
broad and far reaching, and many such exhibitions could not fail to be of
greatest benefit to us as a nation.</p>

<p>The building was the largest possible under amounts appropriated by Congress
for such purpose; the interior space was finely arranged, the exhibits were
splendidly grouped and classified with the result that all articles were
conspicuously placed.The officials and parties in charge were at all times
courteous and kind to visitors and nothing but words of praise and commendation
came from those who visited and attentively examined and studied the exhibits.</p>

<p>There was no one feature of the Government exhibits more generally interesting
to exposition patrons than the Indian Congress.The spectacular sham battles
aroused attention and enthusiasm, and led to the more careful study as to
habits, modes of life and customs of our red brothers.The Indian Congress was
certainly one of the great features of the Exposition.</p>

<p>Following is an abridged copy of the report submitted to the Government by the
Board of Management concerning their trust and the manner in which said trust
was administered by them.This abridged report and the chapter on the Indian
Congress has been kindly supplied by Hon. W. V. Cox, Secretary to the Board of
Management of the U.S. Government exhibits.</p>

the several Departments, but a re-allotment was necessitated by reason of a
joint resolution of Congress approved by President McKinley on December 18,
1897, as follows:</p>

<p>(Public Resolution--No. 2.)</p>

<p>Joint Resolution Extending limit of cost of the Government building or
buildings at the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha,
Nebraska, and reducing cost of Government Exhibit.</p>

<p>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is
hereby, authorized and directed to cause to be constructed and completed, at an
additional cost not to exceed ten thousand dollars, the Government building at
the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha, Nebraska, as shown
and called for by the plans, drawings and specifications on which bids were
taken for its erection, and so forth:and that the Secretary of the Treasury
be, and he is hereby, further authorized and directed to cause to be erected at
said Exposition a building for an exhibit of the United States Life-Saving
Service, at a cost not to exceed for said building the sum of two thousand five
hundred dollars; and to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to give effect to,
and execute the provisions of, this Act, the limit of cost of the Government

fifty thousand dollars to one hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>The Common Fund reserved in the above allotment was set aside to meet general
expenses, including salaries of officer clerks, guards, inspectors and
cleaners, stationery, etc., together with other incidental expenses not
properly chargeable to any one Department.</p>

<p>A re-apportionment of funds was accomplished on September 12, 1898; and on
February 25, 1899, the Board adopted the following resolution, consolidating
the balances of the several allotments into the Common Fund, in order to
facilitate the closing up of the affairs of the Board:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That all unexpended funds of the Board are hereby consolidated into
the Common Fund, and that the Chairman is authorized to allot to the
Representatives such funds as are shown to be necessary to enable their
respective Departments to close up all work in connection with the Exposition,
each account to be approved by the Representative of the Department incurring
the liability, the same to be charged against that Department."</p>

<p>The Government Building.</p>

<p>The Government building was situated at the West end of the Exposition grounds,
at the head of the lagoon, and had the seat of honor of the Exposition, facing,
as it did, the main group of buildings.</p>

<p>It was designed under the general direction of Charles E. Kemper, Acting
Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department, and, later, constructed under the direction of J.K. Taylor, Supervising Architect.It was designed in the classic style, the Ionic order being used.</p>

<p>The main entrance, facingthe center of the lagoon, was reached by a broad
flight of steps, while direct connection was had on each side of the lagoon
with the other buildings of the group by a covered colonnade.</p>

<p>The building was surmounted by a colossal gilded dome, which was in turn capped
by a heroic figure representing "Liberty Enlightening the World."The torch
was 178 feet above the ground.This dome and figure, when illuminated at
night, was a landmark for miles around.</p>

<p>The contract for erecting the structure was let to George Moore and Sons, of
Nashville, Tennessee, who constructed the Government building at the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition of 1897.</p>

<p>Interior Arrangement of Building.</p>

<p>The Government building was so admirably arranged as to make its interior space
completely available for exhibition purposes.Reference to the accompanying
floor plan will aid in understanding the arrangement.</p>

<p>The total available space, including the 742 square feet at the West end of the
transept in the projecting portico, and partly occupied by the workingpost
office, was about 46,000 square feet (#), the main floor space being
approximately 450 by 100 feet.Of this space 36,325 square feet was allotted
for the exhibits of the several departments, (#2) the balance being devoted to
the aisles.The main area was divided equally by an aisle 14 feet wide,
terminating at the North and South Entrances.</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>(#) Including guard, public comfort and storage rooms.
(#2)
From the main, or Eastern entrance, the transverse aisle, also 14 feet wide,
extended inward about 27 feet and terminated in a ring-like aisle beneath the
dome and of the same width.From each side of this circular aisle extended a 5
foot aisle, leading to the toilet rooms and the working post office at the West
side of the building.Two other short aisles, 12 feet wide each, led from the
doors at either extremity of the Eastern colonnade to the central aisle, a
distance of about 40 feet.In the projecting Eastern portico, the guard room
was located South and the photographer's room North of the main entrance, while
the several offices immediately above these rooms were reached by stairs
leading from the north side of the portico.</p>

<p>Interior Decorations.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the Committee on Decorations, the interior walls were covered to the height of 12 feet with maroon-colored burlap, and above that height with gray, and a red strip at the top to serve as a frieze; the
roof-supporting columns were boxed and covered to match the walls, except the twelve central columns which were boxed octagonally and covered with maroon to the height of 7 feet, and above that painted gray.</p>

<p>The partitions separating the exhibits of the different Departments were 12 feet in height and were covered with maroon colored burlap with a black
base-board and cornice.The roof and clerestory trusses and windows were
draped with festoons of cheese cloth in colors of maroon and old gold,
interspersed with United States flags and pennants.The dome was entirely
decorated with the National colors, while draped flags ornamented the columns and the cornices.The effect of these decorations was most pleasing.</p>

<p>Illuminating the Government Building.</p>

<p>As the Government building was not open to the public in the evenings, it was
not lighted interiorly except in the offices, guard room, aquarium, etc., and
for the convenience of policing, for which purpose four arc lamps were provided
in the main aisles.</p>

<p>In order to allow of the expenditure from the building fund of such an amount as would be necessary to wire the Government building for exterior
illumination, the Exposition Company urged upon Congress the passage of a Joint Resolution which was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 30, 1898, by Hon. David H. Mercer, and was passed by both Houses and approved by the President on May 19, as follows:</p>

<p>"JOINT RESOLUTION"</p>

<p>"Authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to rent lighting apparatus for
Government building at Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>

<p>"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is
hereby, authorized to rent electric wiring and lamps for the lighting of the
exterior of the building for the Government exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi
and International Exposition at Omaha, Nebraska, if, in his judgment, such
course will be less expensive than to wire the building and furnish lamps
therefor; the expense thereof to be paid from the unexpended balance of the
appropriation for the construction of said building."</p>

<p>Under authority contained in this resolution, an arrangement was made by the
Secretary of the Treasury with the exposition Bureau of Light and Power, for
the installation, constant inspection and supervision, and maintenance during
the entire Exposition period, of a system of exterior electric lighting,
comprehending a total of eight hundred 16-candle power incandescent lamps, it
being understood that the material supplied was not to become the property of
the Government, but when no longer required by it for Exposition purposes,
would be removed by the Bureau of Light and Power as its property.The total
cost to the Government for this system was $720.</p>

<p>The Exposition Company desiring to augment the illumination of the exhibition
buildings on July Fourth, it was granted permission to place incandescent lamps
upon the dome of the Government building, the same being mounted on rubber
belting, vertically arranged, suspended from the top in order that no damage
would be done to the gilded covering of the dome by nails or screws.While
these lamps were originally intended only for the evening of July Fourth, the
effect of the illuminated dome was so satisfactory and admired that at the
request of the Exposition authorities this extra illumination was allowed to
remain throughout the balance of the Exposition period.</p>

<p>The Government having provided the system of exterior illumination and the
Board feeling that the appropriation could not bear the high cost of supplying
electric current for the same, the Exposition Company was required to provide
such current free of charge, since the result to be obtained was more in the
nature of a feature of the Exposition than a feature of the Government exhibit.</p>

<p>The following statement shows the number of incandescent and arc lamps
installed on the exterior and in the interior of the Government building:</p>

<p>Incandescents Arcs.</p>

<p>Main Exterior, 800 --</p>

<p>Exterior, dome,200 --</p>

<p>Main Interior, ---4</p>

<p>Exhibit spaces, offices, etc.. 916</p>

<p>Totals 1,091 10</p>

<p>Allotment of Space.</p>

<p>Upon the recommendation of the Committee on Allotment of Funds and Space, the several Departments were assigned floor space in the Government Building, but the joint resolution of Congress approved December 18, 1897, (previously quoted), by transferring from the appropriation for the Government building the sum of $12,500, (of which $2,500 was to be expended for the construction of a Life-Saving Station), necessitated a re-apportionment of space as well as funds. To provide for a retrenchment of funds and an increase of space seemed an odd dilemma, but the Board accomplished it, making the final allotment of space:</p>

<p>Square feet.</p>

<p>Department of State,1,288</p>

<p>Treasury Department 3,828</p>

<p>Rotunda Space 388</p>

<p>War Department,4,586</p>

<p>Navy Department, 3,886</p>

<p>Post Office Department, 3,402</p>

<p>Working Post Office Space, 305</p>

<p>Department of the Interior, 4,067</p>

<p>Department of Agriculture, 4,716</p>

<p>Department of Justice, 700</p>

<p>Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, 4,067</p>

<p>Commission of Fish and Fisheries,5,142</p>

<p>Total exhibit space, exclusive of main aisles,36,325 sq. ft.</p>

<p>Care of Building.</p>

<p>The Custodianship of the Government Building was committed by the Secretary of Treasury to W.V. Cox, Secretary of the Board of Management.Mr. Cox acted in this capacity from May 1 to December 5, when, on his return to Washington, he was succeeded by J.J. Hittinger, Assistant to the Representative of the War Department.The care of the Government building during the Exposition period was assigned to the following force:A Superintendent of Exhibits, a Head Janitor, five cleaners, two toilet-room attendants, and sixteen guards.</p>

<p>Guard Force.</p>

<p>The members of the Government Guard were appointed by the Chairman of the
Board, and the force was organized and maintained under "Rules and Regulations"
(#) in part as follows:</p>

<p>Rule 1.The Government Guard of the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition shall consist of not less than sixteen men, duly appointed by the
Chairman of the Board of Management of the United States Government Exhibit.
Rule 2.Members of the Guard must be:</p>

<p>(a) Reputable citizens of the United States, and betwen 21 and 35 years of age.</p>

<p>(b)Men who have served with credit either in the U. S. Regular Army, U. S.
Navy, State or Territorial Militia, Chicago, Atlanta or Nashville Exposition
Guard, or who have been trained in a military school.</p>

<p>(c)Of physical health and vigor, and not less than 5 feet, 8 inches in
height.</p>

<p>(d)Of unquestionable energy, sobriety, and courteous manners.</p>

<p>Rule 3. The Guard will be organized in three Reliefs as follows:</p>

<p>First: 8 o'clock A.M. to 4 o'clock P.M.</p>

<p>Second: 4 o'clock P.M. to 12 o'clock midnight.</p>

<p>Third: 12 o'clock Midnight to 8 o'clock A.M.</p>

<p>Rule 4. Each relief will be composed of a Sergeant and, when possible, not
less than four men, who shall remain on duty eight hours and until regularly
relieved.The Guard will be under the immediate control of the Sergeant, who
shall act under the instructions of the Secretary of the Board, or in his
absence, someone designated by him.</p>

<p>Rule 5. The Sergeant of each Relief will be held responsible for the safe
keeping of all property under his care, and his orders must be obeyed by all
guards.He will make the rounds of the Building at least each hour, and be
reponsible for the enforcement of these rules.</p>

<p>Rule 6. After the Building is closed in the afternoon and until the hour of
re-opening, the guards are forbidden under penalty of dismissal to allow
admission to any persons other than those whose names appear on the posted pass
list or who are provided with properly certified pass signed by the Secretary
or by a Representative on the Board of Management.This also applies on
Sundays, and no exceptions can be made to friends of the guards.A list of the
officers and members of the Board of Mangement, and the employees of the
Building, giving their name and place of residence will be placed on the
bulletin board in the Guard room and will be corrected from day to day.</p>

<p>xxxxxxxxx</p>

<p>At night each guard on duty was provided with an Army revolver, the same having
been loaned to the Board by the War Department, at the solicitation of Major
H.C. Ward, U. S. A., Representative of that Department.</p>

<p>The Guard Room, located in the South Portico at the Eastern entrance to the
Government Building, was provided with lockers, one being assigned to each
Sergeant of the Guard, and each of the remaining ones to two guards.</p>

<p>An arrangement was made with the Exposition authorities for the guards to enter
after closing hours and remain in the grounds at night.This privilege was
also secured for those officers and employees responsible for the protection of
the exhibits and the building.</p>

<p>Protection Against Fire.</p>

<p>The building was amply protected against fire by nine hydrants, to each of
which fifty feet of hose was attached.One hydrant was located at each end of
the main aisle, one beside each of the three Eastern entrances, one at the door
of each toilet room, and two others on the West wall midway between the
transcept aisles and the ends of the building.By this arrangement, no part of
the floor was inaccessible to the hose.Two additional hydrants, with one
hundred feet of hose each, were later located upon the roof.</p>

<p>Storage of Packing Boxes.</p>

<p>All empty packing boxes and crates were stored in the basement of the
Government building, thereby saving both time and expense. To prevent, as far as possible, the occurence of fire among these empties, no excelsior or other packing material was allowed to be stored, and a rigid inspection was made daily of the entire basement</p>

<p>Passes into Exposition Grounds.</p>

<p>No charge was made by the Exposition management, for the admission of persons
connected with the Government exhibit, and the usual deposit of three dollars
for the photographic pass was waived by request in the case of the Government
employees, the Department of Admissions of the Exposition promptly furnishing
pass cards and photographic passes on the application of the Secretary of the
Board.</p>
<p>
The total number of passes into the Exposition grounds issued upon request of
the Secretary of the Board of Government officials and employees was 462, of
which 90 were for the period of installation, 236 for the Exposition period,
and the remainder, 136 for the period of re-packing.</p>

<p>Passes into the Government Building.</p>

<p>With a view to enabling those visitors who could attend the Exposition only on
Sundays, and at night, to see the Government exhibit, pass cards were prepared
and distributed by the members of the Board, on application, for such hours
when the building was closed to the public as would not interfere with any work
going on within the building.On some occasions (such as the President's
reception), special pass cards were prepared.</p>

<p>The Government building was open to visitors every week-day from 9 o'clock A.M.
to 6 o'clock P.M. during the period from June 1 to September 1, from which date
to October 31, it was closed at 5 o'clock P.M.</p>

<p>Detail of Government Employees.</p>

<p>For the period of the Exposition, the number of actual details from all
branches of the Government service was approximately one hundred.</p>

<p>In addition to their regular salaries, officials and employees of the
Government detailed to the Exposition were re-imbursed for their actual
traveling and subsistence expenses.</p>

<p>Freight Transportation.</p>

<p>The Missouri Pacific Railway Company extended its tracks to points near both
the North and South entrances of the Government Building, where platforms were
constructed for unloading and re-loading the exhibits.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that all shipments into Omaha had to be made over land-grant
and bond-aided railroads, shipping of Government exhibits was done through the
quartermaster offices of the War Department, on regular Army bills of lading;
and the settlement of all freight charges had to follow the course adopted by
the War and Treasury Department.</p>

<p>During the period when shipments were being made to the Exposition, the Board
employed W.C. Crawley as a clerk to prepare bills of lading and to keep a
record of same, he being assigned to the office of the Depot Quartermaster at
the War Department, Washington.</p>

<p>Completion of Government Exhibit.</p>

<p>The Installation of the Government exhibit was fully completed before the
opening of the Exposition, and on the afternoon of May 31, those members of the
Board in Omaha at the time informally received the officials of the Exposition
who inspected the building and exhibits.</p>

<p>Visit and Reception of President McKinley.</p>

<p>The most distinguished of all visitors, the President of the United States,
William McKinley, with a notable retinue of civil and military persons, all
conspicuous in the successful conduct of the war with Spain just closed, was
formally received by the Exposition officials during Peace Jubilee Week, on
Wednesday afternoon, October 12, The President, with hisguests, accompanied
by the President of the Exposition and the Chairman of the Government Board,
entered the Government Building at the North entrance and visited successively
the exhibit of each Department, being received by the respective
Representatives.</p>

<p>Later, at about 3 o'clock, the President witnessed from the East porch of the
building the drill of the Life-Saving Service upon the lagoon immediately in
front, after which, re-entering the building he gave an informal reception to
the public in the rotunda.Seats were provided for the Presidential party in
the space of the Department of State and in the Rotunda, while other guests
were seated in adjacent aisles.The presentations to the President were made
by the Chairman of the Board, assisted by the President of the Exposition.An
orchestra, seated in the Smithsonian Institution space, furnished appropriate
music for the occasion.</p>

<p>During the reception, the main aisle was roped off and all doors closed except
the North and South, entrance by the former and exit by the latter.</p>

<p>Order was maintained by the Government Guard and Exposition guards assisted by
the United States infantrymen, marines, and signal corps men, lately returned
from the war with Spain, numbering in all about two hundred, the infantrymen
being under the command of Major W.M. Van Horne, Twenty-second Regiment.</p>

<p>Exposition Postal Service.</p>

<p>In addition to the Department exhibit, the Postmaster-General established a branch working post office in the Government building for the transaction of all kinds of post office business.It was located in the transverse section at the West side of the building, and J.I. Woodard, Assistant Postmaster at Omaha, was in charge.</p>

<p>The following is a statement of the business transacted in the five months from June to October inclusive:</p>

<span class="lg list">

<span class="l">Total volume of business $33,644.61</span></span>

<p>A door opened at the Western end of the transcept into the post office, through
which all mail pouches were received and dispatched, and on Sundays, all
deliveries made.</p>

<p>Exhibitions of Life-Saving Service.</p>

<p>A building for housing the boats and equipment of the Life-Saving Service
exhibit was constructed near the West end of the lagoon, in the rear of the
South colonnade, and exhibitions were given daily, at 4 o'clock P.M., in front
of the Government building.All the usual drill pertaining to the processes of
live-saving from a sinking vessel was given to the great delight of western
visitors, who as a rule, knew little of the service.</p>

<p>Lieutenant C.H. McLellan, of the Revenue Cutter Service, collected and prepared the exhibit and arranged for the drills of the crew. Just before the opening of the Exposition he was called to active naval duty in connection with the war with Spain, and did not return until during the last month of the Exposition, then resuming charge of the exhibit. In his absence the exhibit was in charge of Captain H.M. Knowles, Assistant Superintendent of the third life-saving district. Captain Henry Cleary, of the Marquette (Mich.) life-saving station, was in charge of the crew of eight surfmen.</p>

<p>The daily program was as follows:</p>

<p>1.Life-savers go on patrol; discover signals of distress; line fired over
wreck.</p>

<p>2.Men saved in breeches-buoy; man overboard; rescue with life-boat.</p>

<p>3.The capsize; apparently drowned; resuscitation.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that the life-saving drill soon became one of the most attractive features of the Exposition.</p>

<p>INDIAN CONGRESS.</p>

<p>In the Indian Appropriation Act approved by President McKinley on July 1, 1898,
$40,000 was appropriated for the assembling of representatives of the various
tribes of Indians in an encampment on the Exposition grounds.This encampment
was opened on August 4, and comprised over 500 Indians, representing
thirty-five distinct tribes.The exhibition was known as the Indian Congress,
and was authorized by the Government as a part of the Exposition.It was,
however, under the control of the Secretary of the Interior, and directed by
the Commission of Indian Affairs, being entirely separate from the Government
exhibits under the direction of the Board.</p>

<p>REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE

of the

DEPARTMENT of STATE.</p>

<p>A floor space of 1,288 square feet was allotted to the Department of State for
its exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.This space
was situated in the center of the Government building, directly opposite the
main entrance, and was well adapted for the purpose of the exhibit.There was
in-sufficient wall space in the original plan, but this deficiency was met by
erecting two partitions, running from the back wall, twenty feet towards the
center of the building, to two pillars within the limits of the space.This
arrangement divided the space into three sections, the center one being
occupied by cases along the walls, in which were exhibited the relics, valuable
historical papers and treaties.The Chief Special Agent and a messenger
occupied desks within this central section and were thus enabled to constantly
watch articles exhibited.Ample hanging room was provided and the two pillars
mentioned were utilized for exhibition purposes.The front space was circular
in form and was enclosed with a brass rail, which protected the glass cases and
added much to the general appearance of the exhibit.</p>

<p>The use of oilcloth covers for the cases, during the hours when the building
was closed to the visitors, was found to be a great protection against both
dust and the leakage of rain water from the roof.</p>

<p>Mr. John M. Biddle, a clerk of class two, Department of State, was appointed
Chief Special Agent by the Secretary of State, and detailed to assist the
Representative in the preparation, installation and maintenance of the exhibit.</p>

<p>He proceeded to Omaha on May 1, and remained until November following.It was
found necessary to employ a messenger, a resident of the State of Nebraska,
who, in addition to his duties as Assistant to the Chief Special Agent,
performed the duties of Janitor.</p>

<p>The Department of State is the custodian of many of the original state papers
and historical documents relating to the early history and formation of this
Government.These documents are considered too valuable to be removed from the
Department, and consequently substitutes known as "artotypes" are used in
department exhibits instead of the originals.The artotypes are so well
executed that it is difficult to distinguish them from the originals, and for
all practical purposes meet all the requirements, the substitute being fully as
interesting to the student and visitors as the originals would be.</p>

<p>An exhibit illustrating as fully as possible the workings of the six bureaus of
this Department was made, particular attention being paid to the Bureau of
Rolls and Library, which is charged with the custody and promulgation of the
laws passed by Congress.Photographic copies were used to illustrate the
changes in size, from the parchment and of engrossing and printing the laws.</p>

<p>Particular pains were made to illustrate the workings of the Passport Division,
which comes under the Bureau of Accounts, for the reason that a very general
interest centers in this branch of the Department service, by reason of the
large number of persons, who travel abroad each year and most of whom take with
them for their convenience and protection a passport.The entire method of
obtaining a passport was illustrated, which included an exhibit of the
different blank forms of application used, all necessary instructions as to
procuring and filling out the same being given.Letters showing the common
mistakes made by applicants for passports were also exhibited.</p>

<p>A Pamphlet was issued entitled "The Department of State of the United States;
How it was formed; What are its duties, and How it is Run." and the same was
distributed to a very large number of visitors.This pamphlet gave a popular
account of the formation and growth of the Department of State, the duties of
the Secretary of State, and the nature of the work performed by each Bureau.</p>

<p>The following named relics were exhibited:</p>

<p>Washington's sword and belt and Benjamin Franklin's staff (bequeathed by
Franklin to Washington.)These were presented to the United Stated by Samuel
T. Washington, to Whom General Washington bequeathed them, and accepted by
Congress in a joint resolution in 1842.</p>

<p>General Washington's eyeglasses, given by him to LaFayette and presented to the
United States by Count Oclave d'Assailly, the great grandson of Lafayette.</p>

<p>An equestrian statuette of Washington by Baron Marchette, from the original
study and model by his master, M. Houdon, of Paris,1785-1790, presented to
the United States by the Right Honorable George Young of Edinburough, Scotland.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson's desk, on which the original draft of the Declaration of
Independence was written.</p>

<p>A volume taken from each of the restored papers of Washington, Franklin,
Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and Hamilton.</p>

<p>Autograph letters from the heads of Foreign Governments to the President of the
United States, including a number from Louis XVI, offering aid to the United
States during the Revolution.</p>

<p>Original proclamations, one signed by each President of the United States.</p>

<p>Treaties between the United States and foreign countries.</p>

<p>Address of thanks of the nobility of St. Petersburg to the people of the United
States, for the grain sent to the starving peasants in 1892.</p>

<p>Medals from the heads of foreign governments to the President of the United
States, commemorating particular events.</p>

<p>A silk flag, woven in one piece, presented to the United States by the weavers
of Lyons, as a token of sympathy upon the death of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Maps illustrating the growth of the consular service, from the beginning to
date.</p>

<p>Deed of gift of the Bartholdi Statue and duplicate of the acceptance of the
same.</p>

<p>Seal of the United States emblazoned in oils and draped in flags, forming an
ornamental decoration over the center of the back partition.</p>

<p>An artotype of the Constitution, surrounded by portraits of the signers.</p>

<p>A facsimile of the Declaration of Independence, surrounded by portraits of the
signers, and an artotype of the original rough draft of the Declaration with
interlinations by Franklin and Adams.</p>

<p>A complete set of wash-drawings of portraits of the Secretaries of State, and a
set of engravings of the Presidents.</p>

<p>Photographs of a number of buildings occupied by the United States as Consuls,
together with photographs of rooms in the Department of State were exhibited in
swing frames and hung on one of the pillars, the other pillar being used to
exhibit the proclamation above mentioned.</p>

<p>WILLIAM H. MICHAEL,</p>

<p>Representative, Department of State.</p>

<div class="chapter doublespace ">

<p>REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE

of the

TREASURY DEPARTMENT</p>

<p>The exhibits of the Treasury Department at the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition were selected and prepared after conferences with the
heads of the various offices and Bureaus, and the bulk of the packing,
removing, installing and decorating, was executed under contract with Mr. J. B.
Morrey, of Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>In the assignment of space and the allotment of funds the Treasury Department
received its quota of each, and the following offices and bureaus of the
Department united in making exhibits:</p>

<p>The BUREAU OF THE MINT exhibited a coin press, sent from the San Francisco
Mint, which was run almost daily by electric power.This press struck the
souvenir medals for the Exposition authorities, and was the admiration of all
who had never before seen an exhibition of the manner in which the metallic
money of the United States is made.This Bureau also displayed a full
collection of National medals commemorative of various events in our national
life, together with a complete set of the current coinage of the United States
from, and including, the year 1793 to 1898, numbering 1,084 pieces.This
collection, though not large, attracted a great deal of attention and was
subject to much admiring comments.</p>

<p>The BUREAU OF ENGRAVING AND PRINTING displayed in large and handsomely gilded
frames proof-sheets of the various denominations, in colors, of United States
notes, certificates, postage and revenue stamps; the wonderfully accurate
execution of which was the daily comment of scrutinizing visitors, and the
finely engraved pictures of the President and public men of this country were
the constant study and admiration of the masses.</p>

<p>The exhibit from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing always attracts much
attention at Expositions, because the people can see at a glance all the paper
currency and securities issued by the Government.</p>

<p>The office of the REGISTER OF THE TREASURY exhibited, upon upright pedestals,
carefully arranged frames enclosing canceled United States notes and bonds,
specimens of old State bank issues, obsolete and "wild-cat" money, specimens of
Confederate States notes and bonds, and the various denominations of postal
currency.</p>

<p>The COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY displayed a full collection of the standard
weights, lines and measures of the United States, conspicuously arranged in
order to afford the best opportunity for examination.The fine model of the
Coast Survey Steamer "Blake", its appurtenances and outfit for deep-sea
soundings and coast surveys, caused--with the carefully arranged exhibit of
maps and charts--much interest in the minds of those who examined the same.</p>

<p>The INTERNAL REVENUE BUREAU exhibited in superb and carefully arranged gilded
frames a great variety of denominations of revenue stamps which attracted much
attention.</p>

<p>The OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY loaned many portraits of
Secretaries of the Treasury at different periods in the country's history.</p>

<p>The MARINE HOSPITAL SERVICE made a full and elaborate exhibit, personally
installed and arranged with great care by Dr. J. J. Kinyoun of that bureau,
which completely illustrated its various functions, showing every instrument
and modern appliance to be found in a first-class hospital.The exhibit was of
surpassing interest and educational advantage to the many thousands of people
passing through it daily.The Roentgen, or X-ray, apparatus was operated and
explained by a competent operator, to the interest and wonder of all who
witnessed it.Large numbers of medical men and professors of colleges with
classes of students expressed great gratification in witnessing the operation
of this exhibit, and the disinfecting apparatus, with its application of steam,
or formaldehyde gas, as well as other parts of this interesting exhibit was
explained and appreciated.</p>

<p>The LIGHTHOUSE ESTABLISHMENT made a complete exhibit of all lenses, lanterns,
wicks, and materials used in the lighthouse stations of the Government.Among
the chief features of this exhibit was a large and expensive first-order
bi-valve lense in operation, lighted by electricity, revolving its powerful
light in prismatic colors through the exhibit space of the building.</p>

<p>The LIFE-SAVING SERVICE was represented by a fully equipped and thoroughly
disciplined and active body of eight surfmen, with a captain, under the general
superintendence of Captain H. M. Knowles.The crew gave, at regular hours,
almost daily drills and exhibitions of their skill and daring upon the lagoon. 
These never failed to draw immense crowds. No part of the Government exhibits
at Omaha attracted so much attention as this of the Life-Saving service, and to
the hearty co-operation of Mr. Sumner I. Kimball, the General Superintendent of
the Life-Saving Service, much of its success is due.</p>

<p>The OFFICE OF THE SUPERVISING ARCHITECT exhibited handsomely framed
perspectives of the more modern buildings constructed by the Treasury
Department, and I may be pardoned in saying that the buildings thus exhibited,
showed the advancement in architectural skill which the office has made in
recent years.</p>

<p>The entire exhibit of the Treasury Department was transported to great distance
to Omaha, installed, shown throughout the Exposition period, re-packed at the
close, and returned to the several points of original shipment, with scarcely
any loss, breakage or accident of any kind.</p>

<p>Owing to the pressure of my official duties in Washington, it was found
impossible to give much personal attention to the exhibit at Omaha, and by the
kind courtesy of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. G. H. Beckwith was chosen
to represent me there.He supervised and cared for the exhibit, and at the
close of the Exposition, attended it safe return to the points of original
shipment.Mr. Beckwith was tireless in his efforts to promote the best
interests of the Department, and to his energy honesty and desire to reflect
credit upon the Treasury Department, much of the achieved success is due.The
Department never had a more faithful employee in its service, and when he
resigned on February 1, 1899, to accept another position, I parted with him
officially with much regret.</p>

<p>The Exhibit of the Treasury Department was made at a cost of $16,036.49, as shown by the following classified statement:</p>

<p>ORDNANCE DEPARTMENT-- The exhibit of this Department was not nearly as complete
as was originally intended, as the demands made on the Department, owing to the
War with Spain, prevented the making of a display of heavy ordinance and
materials.There was shown a very interesting collection of small arms, in six

forces on the 17th of July, 1898.</p>

<p>The first Spanish trophy secured in Cuba-a regimental Spanish flag, which was
captured at the battle of Juragasita, Cuba, on June 23, 1898 by company "B",
22nd United States Infantry, from Fort Crook, Nebraska:the names of the men
who made this capture being Corporal Nueman, Corporal Boyle, and Privates
Keyser, Cooley and Houghsalling.</p>

<p>A large Spanish flag, taken from the converted cruiser "Mexico" in the harbor
of Santiago de Cuba, July 17, 1898, the date of the surrender of the City to
the American forces.</p>

<p>Twenty Mauser rifles, captured at Santiago; these rifles being exhibited in the
identical condition they were in when taken from the hands of the Spanish
soldiers.</p>

<p>Ten bronze muzzle-loading cannon, taken form the forts in the harbor of
Santiago de Cuba, on the surrender of the city on July 17, 1898; 7 six-inch and
3 four-inch guns.They were pronounced by all who saw them as being remarkably
fine specimens of ancient cannon.They were all made in the gun foundry at
Douay, France, the dates of manufacture beingfrom 1693 to 1755.Each gun is
highly ornamental and bears the coat-of-arms of the Bourbons of France, as well
as two Latin mottoes, viz:"Ultima Ration regum", (The last argument of
Kings); "Nec pluribus impar" (Unequaled among many), and a distinctive name. 
The history of these guns is not known, nor how the Spanish gained possession
of them; but that they are valuable trophys of war, all must admit.</p>

<p>The Santiago was balloon which was used in the battles in front of Santiago de
Cuba, by American forces under the command of General Shafter.On June 30,
1898, this balloon was sent up four times, carrying members of general
Shafter's staff, officers of the Engineer Corps, United States Army, and the
Cuban General, Castillo.During the advance of the Army, on July 1, the
balloon was sent up and when near the point known as Nell's Crossing, a
scathing fire was poured into the inflated bag.Three shells from a shrapnel
battery tore great holes in it, and showers of bullets made it resemble a great
sieve.The balloon was very near the fighting lines, parading up and down the
lines and served to mark the American's position to the enemy, who concentrated
all their fire in that location.Its elevation when punctured was 350 feet. 
The balloon finally landed in the San Juan River, and was recovered after the
battles.</p>

<p>REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE

of the

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.</p>

<p>As Representative of the Department of Justice, I have the honor to submit the
following report:</p>

<p>Having been selected by the Attorney General to represent his Department on the
Board of Management for the Government exhibit at the Recent Expositions at
Atlanta, Georgia, and Nashville, Tennessee, the experience thus gained has
enabled me, while serving in the same capacity in connection with the
Exposition at Omaha, to obtain results,at least as satisfactory as
heretofore,at a minimum of expense, time and labor.The lines on which we
could move had become familiar, and the work of preparing the exhibit, being no
longer experimental, proceeded smoothly to completion.Necessarily the
features of these exhibits become familiar to many, by repetition and
reproduction, but are,of course, new and interesting to the general visitor at
each succeeding exposition.</p>

<p>In view of the similarity in the character of these exhibits, I have deemed it
proper, in submitting this report, to adopt the same language substantially as
used in my reports heretofore presented on like occasions.</p>

<p>The Act to encourage the holding of the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition at Omaha, Nebraska, provided for the exhibition by the Government of
such articles and materials as illustrate the function and administrative
faculty of the Government, tending to demonstrate the nature of our
institutions and their adaptations to the wants of the people.</p>

<p>A Department dealing mostly with questions of law, can not compete in any way
as an exhibitor of entertaining objects illustrating its functions, with most
of the other Executive Departments.An earnest effort was made by the
Representative, however, to collect and arrange materials for the exhibit at
Omaha, which would be interesting to the majority of citizens, and as
representing the best manner some, at least, of the functions of the
Department.</p>

<p>The collection of portraits of the Attorneys General, from the time of Randolph
to the present, occupied most of the wall space, and was one of the chief
features of interest.These portraits of distinguished men are always
interesting to visitors from every section of the country, and their value is
constantly increasing with the lapse of time.</p>

<p>A complete exhibit of blanks and forms was presented, showing the method and
course of routine officials business in the Department, including pardons by
the Executive, and was found to be interesting and attractive.Rare copies of
legal books were shown, also many ancient publications of interest to the legal
profession, among them being the collection of State Trials and Proceedings for
High Treason, commencing with the eleventh year of the reign of King Richard
II, and ending with the sixteenth year of the reign of King George III, by
Francis Hargrave, Esquire, published in London, in 1776.This collection
consists of six books, containing completed records of the trials of Mary Queen
of Scots, Sir Walter Raleigh, Charles I, Richard III, Captain William Kidd,
etc.</p>

<p>As this Department is charged with the supervision of United States prisoners
and prisons, a collection of pictures and objects was secured, illustrating
those features.Drawings showing the plan of the New United States
Penitentiary, now being erected at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; photographs
illustrating the employment of prisoners in the various prisons of the country,
and photographs of the prison buildings, with many specimens of the handiwork
of the prisoners, were exhibited, and attracted general attention.It has been
found that most every one is interested in anything connected with prison life;
and the care and treatment of prisoners, their daily life, and occupations, are
studied and observed not only by a large class of persons interested in
penology, but by citizens generally.</p>

<p>The same course with regard to the installation and shipment of the
Department's exhibit was followed as that so successfully adopted for the
expositions held at Atlanta and Nashville.A contract was made with a reliable
party to pack and ship the entire outfit to Omaha, install it in the Government
building, and to re-pack, re-ship, and re-place the articles at the close of
the Exposition, all of which was carried out under the personal supervision of
the Representative.The result, as heretofore, proved satisfactory in every
respect.</p>

<p>REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE

of the

POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.</p>

<p>The exhibits of the Post Office Department occupied a space near the rotunda of
the Government, facing on the main aisle, adjacent to and between the displays
of the Department of State and the Commission of Fish and Fisheries.The area
assigned was in the form of a rectangle, and contained about 3,400 square feet.</p>

<p>The preparation of the exhibits was commenced about the first of January, 1898,
and continued to begin the work of packing.The preparation consisted in
collecting materials from the various Bureaus of the Department and preparing
the same for exhibition purposes.There was a very large quantity of material
collected in this way, which had never been previously exhibited.Many series
of postage stamps were mounted and artistically grouped, transportation models
repaired, pictures framed, and material of the most interesting character
selected which experience had shown to be of the greatest interest to the
general public.</p>

<p>It was the desire of the Representative to exhibit those features of the postal
service which would best represent the various branches of its actual workings,
and thereby better show the system employed in this and foreign countries in
the handling and delivery of the millions of tons of mail matter annually
transported.</p>

<p>A number of new exhibition cases were made to supersede those of an antiquated
pattern then in use in the Postal Museum, which were entirely unsuited for the
purposes of proper display.</p>

<p>When the installation of the exhibits was commenced, it was found desirable,
owing to the nature of the space assigned, and the character of the material to
be exhibited, to erect a partition extending from the back wall to the center
aisle, forming two divisions of the space.These divisions were equal in size
and were connected by arches in the partition.This partition not only aided
the grouping and proper classification but added to the wall space, which had
not been sufficient for the purposes required.In the first of these
divisions, the one nearest the center of the building, it was intended to
display material pertaining to the equipment branch of the service and models
illustrative of the methods of mail transportation.In the second division
were the stamps, historical records, and dead-letter exhibits.This plan of
arrangement was adhered to throughout the exhibit, with slight exceptions made
necessary to allow for improving the general appearance of the display.</p>

<p>A description of the material exhibited can best be given by its classification
under the various Divisions, as follows:</p>

<p>THE STAMP DIVISION'S exhibits,much of which was entirely new, was prepared by
the Curator of the Postal Museum and the Assistant to the Representative, and
embraced the following:</p>

<p>1.A complete series of United States postage stamps from their introduction
in 1847.Included in this collection were the Departmental, special delivery,
postage-due, and newspaper periodical stamps.</p>

<p>2.Complete sets of stamped envelopes from their introduction in 1863 to 1898.</p>

<p>3.Sets of foreign stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards from all
stamp-issuing countries in the world.</p>

<p>4.A collection of entire sheets of stamps before being gummed, perforated or cut, showing the process of manufacture.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Mr. Madison Davis, Chief Clerk of the Office of the
Third Assistant Postmaster General, the series of stamps issued commemorative
to the Exposition was added to the collection.This series was represented by
entire sheets of each denomination, each sheet being the first impression taken
from the plates, and arriving some time before the stamps were placed on sale;
they proved a most interesting exhibit.</p>

<p>The collection of stamps was shown to good advantage by means of the wall space
contiguous to the exhibit, and by two column cases on each of which were hung
96 frames in which the stamps were artistically mounted.In this collection
there was displayed on these cases and the walls, 400 frames containing stamps
and photographs of post offices, and methods of transportation in this and
other countries.Of this number 200 were devoted entirely to stamps, each
frame displaying from 50 to 400.The issues of the different countries were
grouped in a manner affording ready facility for finding any particular issue.</p>

<p>THE EQUIPMENT DIVISION was represented by life-sized models of uniformed mail carriers of this and other countries, fully equipped; and the following;</p>

<p>A complete collection of United States mail bags and pouches.</p>

<p>A collection of foreign mail bags and pouches.</p>

<p>A collection of foreign mail carriers' uniforms and equipment in use in the
principal countries of the world (Notable among which were those presented to
the United States by Japan and Sweden).</p>
<p>
A collection of post-marking stamps and locks in use in the United States from
1800 to the present time, showing the great progressing development from the
crude padlock of a hundred years ago to the complex registered lock of today.</p>

<p>A large collection of foreign equipment, including post-office marking stamps,
letter scales, etc.</p>

<p>Pictures and photographs of vehicles employed in the United States and Foreign
countries in the transportation of the mails.</p>

<p>Illustrative of the methods of mail transportation employed by the United
States, were shown the following:</p>

<p>A model of the "Southerner". the first steam vessel to carry mail across the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>A model of the steamship, "City of Paris", complete in every detail,--a
striking contrast to that of the "Southerner", and having additional interest
because of its use by the Government during the period of the Exposition as the
auxiliary cruiser "Yale", in the Spanish American War.</p>

<p>A model of the "Ochlawaha", a type of the steamer in use on the small rivers of
the country, principally in the Southern States.</p>

<p>A model of the steamboat "City of St. Louis", a vessel in use on the
Mississippi River, which was presented to the Postal Museum by the St. Louis
Merchants Exchange, through the kindly efforts of its Secretary, Hon. George H.
Morgan.</p>

<p>A model of a German mail and passenger coach, illustrative of the rural service
as it now exists in that country; also models of a mail wagon and collecting
cart in use in German cities.</p>

<p>DEAD LETTER DIVISION.A large space was devoted to the dead-letter exhibits. 
Every possible manner in which letters and packages are miscarried was shown
and if carefully inspected, would have insured the visitor against committing
any of the errors, which, in spite of all efforts of the Department to prevent,
cause thousands of letters and packages to fail both of deliver and return to
the persons who mailed them.This object lesson was of unquestionable value to
the thousands who visited the exhibit and may prove fruitful of good results
both to the public and to the Department.</p>

<p>In this collection were exhibited a variety of misdirected letters which had
passed through the Dead Letter Office, and had been eventually delivered to the
persons for whom they were intended.The collection fully illustrated the
various steps taken by the Department to locate the persons for whom the
letters were intended.During the Exposition, 300 souvenir postal cards were
received at the branch station of the Omaha Post Office, located in the
Government building, the address side of which were entirely blank.These were
placed in the Department's exhibit.</p>

<p>There was also displayed a large collection of articles that had found their
way to the Dead Letter Office, showing the variety of matter that passes 
through the mails.This display included paintings,photographs,
agricultural implements, kitchen utensils, Indian relics,wearing apparel,
jewelry, food stuffs, trinkets of every description,books, papers, etc..</p>

<p>DIVISION OF MAIL DEPREDATIONS.This Division exhibited several old
mail bags which had been cut open and robbed, illustration the dangers
attending the transportation of mails in some of the newly settledsections
of our country.There was also exhibited a variety of articleswhich had
been confiscated because of prohibited transmission through themails by
postal laws, among which were deadly weapons, explosive bombs,poisonous
reptiles and insects, poisonous liquids and compounds, opium,and other
articles of a like character.Much interest was evinced in an"infernal
machine" which had been mailed to the Commander of the Spanishwarship
"Viscays" while anchored in New York harbor, after thedestruction of the
Maine.This package failed of delivery, owing to thevigilance of the postal
authorities, by whom it was confiscated and itscontents rendered harmless.</p>

<p>DIVISION OF HISTORY, RECORDS AND STATISTICS.This Divisiondisplayed
a post office ledger in the handwriting of the illustriousBenjamin Franklin,
Postmaster General for the American Colonies, and alsothe following:</p>

<p>The growth of the postal service was illustrated by an exhibit offive
old ledgers kept during the War of the Revolution by the PostmasterGeneral,
embodying the accounts of about 75 postmasters (all there wereat that time),
in contrast to a conspicuous statistical chart, showingthe magnitude of the
service at the present date.</p>

<p>Numbers of old letters that had passed through the mails, before the
introduction of postage stamps.</p>

<p>A report of a committee of the United States Senate, dated January20,
1829, on the transportation of the mails on Sunday, the propriety ofwhich
became a serious and prolonged discussion both in and out ofCongress.</p>

<p>Framed statistics of the postal service of the United States.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the postal service of the United States as compared
with France, Germany and Great Britain.</p>

<p>An exhibit of articles partially showing the manner of transacting
postal business by foreign administrations, contributed by some of the
countries constituting the Universal Postal Union.</p>

registered letter and a postal card.</p>

<p>Pictures of foreign and United States post offices.</p>

<p>Portraits of Benjamin Franklin, the first, and the succeeding
Postmaster Generals.</p>

<p>In connection with the Department's exhibit, several thousand copies
of a publication was distributed, under the title of "A Brief Sketch ofthe
Postal Service", which was embodied a history of the same withinformation in
regard to the administration of the various Bureaus of theDepartment, the
rates of postage, postal regulations, etc.The materialfor this publication
was collected by Mr. S. I. Slack, Curator of thePostal Museum.</p>

<p>On the day after the closing of the Exposition, the work of packing
begun and by November 15 completed, when the entire exhibit was shippedto
Washington.The re-installation was begun December 1, the date of the
arrival of the cars in Washington, and was hastened to a speedyconclusion.</p>

<p>The material prepared and all cases purchased for the Expositionwere
designed for permanent use in the Postal Museum after the close ofthe
Exposition.In this way the benefits derived from the expenditureare well
represented in the lasting addition made to the Museum,everything secured
for the exhibit being now a factor of the Museum'sdisplay.</p>

<p>As Representative of the Post Office Department on the Board of
Management of the Government Exhibit, the Postmaster General designatedthe
undersigned, of the office of the Second Assistant PostmasterGeneral.The
Representative was greatly aided in the preparation,installation and
maintenance of the exhibit by having as his assistant,Mr. S. I. Slack,
Curator of the Postal Museum, who had served in asimilar capacity at the
exposition held at Atlanta, Georgia, andNashville, Tennessee, and to whose
ingenuity, skill and experience muchof the success attained is due.</p>

<p>In conclusion the Representative feels it his duty, as it is a
pleasure, to express his appreciation of the valuable assistance renderedby
the Honorable James A. Gary, who was the Postmaster General untilafter the
exhibits were shipped, and of the great interest he took inpromoting a
creditable and successful exhibit.</p>

<p>REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE

of the

NAVY DEPARTMENT.</p>

<p>Before the close of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition of 1897, an
appropriation was made by Congress for the United States Government to
participate in the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, of the
following year, consequently a large portion of the Navy Department'sexhibit
was shipped to the Washington Navy Yard and stored ready for re-shipment to
Omaha.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the funds apportioned to the Department being ample
to make a creditable exhibit, arrangements were made for the constructionof
several articles which would be attractive and also offer a means of
instructing the public.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, a dummy
breech of a thirteen-inch gun was cast and carefully finished to receivea
bona fide thirteen-inch plug loaned for the occasion.</p>

<p>By request, the Chief of the Bureau of Construction and repair
directed the following named articles be supplied, viz:a large sized
reproduction of the seal of the department carved out of mahogany; arichly 
carved frame to contain facsimile of every medal awarded by theUnited States
Naval officers; a model of a state-room, full-sized andcompletely furnished;
and a working model of a timber dry dock, withbasin, built on a scale of
one-quarter inch to the foot.In connectionwith this dock, a model of the
Battleship "Illinois" was constructed andloaned to the Department by private
individuals for this Exposition, tobe floated in the basin to illustrate the
docking of a ship.</p>

<p>Anything that has "life" to it, as in a working model, attracts and
holds the attention.This is exemplified by the tired-and-get-through- 
with-it manner in which many visit an exhibit, without halting or casting
hardly a glance at objects displayed at a great expense of labor andmoney,
yet stopping and giving all attention when anything, howevertrivial, is
moving.</p>

<p>For this reason, to give "life" and thus create an interest and fix
the attention, the working model of a dry dock was conceived and was most
satisfactory in its results.</p>

<p>The "Docking of the Model Battleship 'Illinois'" at a certain hour
daily, was announced on the bulletin boards stationed about theExposition
grounds.In order to obtain good positions, people began togather about the
model long before the appointed time, and all that thevoice could reach were
collected in the neighborhood of the dock when thedemonstration of the same
was begun by the Representative. This wasfollowed by a general description
of the entire exhibit, given in a brieftalk.</p>

<p>The Representative (undersigned) embraced in these talks the
explanation of everything to be seen about the models and everything
suggested by the questions that had been asked from time to time by visitors.</p>

<p>Boats, guns, torpedoes, shells, air ports, life buoys, anchors,
officers' quarters, etc., etc., were pointed out and attention called tothe
full-sized or real ones in exhibit.The halyards on the modelssuggested the
manner of signaling, which was explained,--theInternational and Navy Code
flags being displayed on the walls for thispurpose and not for decoration. 
Then followed a statement of the utilityof the navy, its necessity and
requirements. Upon special occasions thedocking of the ship was repeated,
but with these exceptions it was deemedinadvisable to give it oftener than
once daily.</p>

<p>Owing to the war with Spain, no rapid fire guns or torpedoes were
available for exhibit early in the season, nor could a detail of Marinesbe
provided.Four men, three of whom had served in the Navy, and one inthe
Navy Militia, were engaged to keep the Department's space in properorder and
act as instructors.The interest aroused by the war and thesuccess of the
Navy presented opportunities to teach the Westerners factsin regard to the
Navy that they had never before been interested in.</p>

<p>The Representative (undersigned) directed that his assistant,
Lieutenant S. J. Logan, U.S.M.C. (retired), and the men, above mentioned
should appear in uniform.Thus, as part of the exhibit, there weredisplayed
uniforms of a Line Officer, a Marine Officer, a Chief PettyOfficer, a
Sergeant of Marines, a Boatswain's Mate, and a Coxswain, oneof the latter
being white.These men were directed to be constant intheir efforts to
describe to visitors the various articles on exhibit.</p>

<p>It being observed that the questions of many visitors denoted more
than idle curiosity, the Representative had a small book published,giving in
concise form information calculated to interest, as well asinstruct them. 
Three thousand copies were distributed with discretion,and during the
Exposition, one failed to find them cast aside in therubbish of circulars,
advertisements, etc., that the tired visitors leftabout the grounds.</p>

<p>The Navy exhibit occupied about three thousand nine hundred square
feet of space, about forty-two by ninety-two feet, located in the Northend
of the Government building and on the East side of the main aisle.</p>

placed on exhibition by the Department.These were of intense interestof
the public.The Colonel Commandant of Marines detailed to theExposition a

of special interest, being intelligent and zealous ingiving information, and
were always surrounded with scores of visitors.</p>

confident that the result will be wider in its reachand more effective in
its character.</p>

<p>Eleven thousand, nine hundred and sixteen dollars and sixty seven

<p>REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE

of the

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.</p>

<p>Upon the organization of the Board of Management of the Government
Exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, the sum of
$16,500 (#) and a floor space amounting to 4,067 square feet wereallotted to
the Department of the Interior.This space was near thecenter of the
Government building, bounded on three sides by main aisles,and abutting at
the one corner upon the grand central rotunda.In mostrespects it was one
of the best spaces in the building, and one in whichthe exhibits could be
conspicuously and advantageously placed.</p>

<p>The Bureaus of the Department which were represented in the exhibit
were as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">The Patent Office,</span>
<span class="l">The General Land Office,</span>
<span class="l">The Bureau of Indian Affairs,</span>
<span class="l">The Bureau of Education,</span>
<span class="l">The Geological Survey,</span></span>

<p>For each of these bureaus a separate report is appended.</p>

<p>In certain respects the work of preparation for the Exposition at
Omaha overlapped the closing of the Department's exhibit at the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition, held at Nashville in 1897.A large part of the
material exhibited at Nashville was there packed for storage and wasshipped
to Omaha without re-opening, a procedure which economized bothexpense and
labor.One result of this plan was a consolidation offreight charges,
which, at previous expositions, have been separatelyassessed upon the
allotments of the several bureaus, but which now appearunder the heading of
expenditures on account of the Department ingeneral.To segregate the
stored exhibits and ship on separate bills oflading would have entailed upon
the officers of the Department a uselesslabor, with no economy of cost; and
hence the statement of expensesindicates an increase upon the side of the
general fund and a lesseningof the accounts of the Bureaus.</p>

<p>The following expenses were charged to the account or the Department
as a unit:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Labor and services,--------------------------------$709.55</span>
<span class="l">Travel and subsistence,----------------------------457.20</span>
<span class="l">Freight, carage, expressage,----------------------- 1,211.37</span>
<span class="l">Light and heat,------------------------------------ 67.52</span>
<span class="l">Decorations,--------------------------------------- 50.00</span>
<span class="l">Office expenses,----------------------------------- 47.00</span>
<span class="l">Miscellaneous,-------------------------------------182.20</span>
<span class="l"> $2,724.64</span></span>

<p>(#) See statement of re-apportionment and transfers of funds.The sum
total of all expenditures was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">The Department,------------------------------------$2,724.64</span>
<span class="l">Patent Office,------------------------------------- 2,769.23</span>
<span class="l">Bureau of Indian Affairs,-------------------------- 1,006.35</span>

<span class="l">The Geological Survey,----------------------------- 2,685.56</span>

<span class="l">Expended,----------------------------------------- 12,285.81</span>
<span class="l">Returned to common fund, (#)----------------------4,214.19</span></span>

<p>The unexpended surplus is due partly to economies resulting from the
Tennessee Centennial overlap, and partly to the fact that the space to be
filled at Omaha was relatively small, when compared with that covered at
other expositions.</p>

<p>These models, though few in number, were exhibited as showing the
advance in various mechanical arts, and, to the extent, the encouragement
given to the inventive world by the American patent system, and its
beneficial results to the public at large.</p>

<p>This official exhibit was supplemented by loans from private
individuals throughout the country, to whose courtesy and interest theOffice
is greatly indebted.</p>

<p>Notably among these were collections of Harvesting Machines,furnished
respectively by the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company ofChicago, and the
Deering Harvester Company of the same place, both ofwhich created marked
interest among the visiting public.</p>

<p>Mr. Dwight E. Tripp supplies an attractive exhibit of colored
photography produced by the McDonough process, together with a handsome
illuminated case for its exhibition, and the effect was both novel and
pleasing.</p>

<p>A very interesting collection of samples dyed with coal tar products
was furnished by Wm. J. Matheson &amp; Co., of New York.</p>

<p>Samples of alcohol and whiskey, produced from calcium carbide, byMr.
Herman L. Horstenstein, of Bellaire, Ohio, were sent by him andexhibited in
one of the cases.</p>

<p>Prof. Charles E. Munroe, of Columbia University, Washington, very
kindly loaned specimens of hard metal showing the remarkable effectsproduced
by the detonation thereon of high explosives, such as guncotton, etc., the
same being accompanied by dummies illustrating theappearances of various
high explosives.</p>

<p>An exhibit of ancient and modern ploughs furnished by Messrs. Deere&amp;
Company, of Mcline, Illinois, and arranged attractively, formed animportant
feature of the display, and received special attention.</p>

<p>Two machines for baling cotton in cylindrical form were supplied by
the American Cotton Company of New York, and Mr. George A. Lowrt ofChicago,
and were exhibited as showing a new departure in baling cotton,for which
great advantages are claimed in the matter of compactness, easeof handling,
and economy of space.</p>

<p>The McKay Consolidated Lasting Machine Company of Boston, sent oneof
their full-sized working machines, showing their latest invention in
automatically lasting boots and shoes, and this was a prominent featureof
the exhibit.</p>

<p>Three automatic musical instruments were supplied by the ReginaMusic
Box Company of Rahway, New Jersey, and gave much pleasure tovisitors.</p>

<p>Mr. P. T. Dodge, President of the Mergenthaler Linotype Machinery
Company of New York, exhibited one of the Companys working machines witha
skilled operator to manipulate it, and this, when operated, wassurrounded by
crowds of visitors.</p>

<p>Two arc lamps of the latest pattern were furnished by the
International Arc Lamp Company of New York.</p>

<p>All of these articles, generously loaned by their respective owners,
added greatly to the success of the Patent Office exhibit.It is safe to
assume that the display did much to increase the interest of the visiting
public, and to bring them into closer touch with the operations of the
Several Departments of the Government.</p>

<p>GENERAL LAND OFFICE.</p>

<p>The importance of a Bureau as a part of the Government has norelation
to its value in an exposition display.An altogetherinsignificant office
may have great possibilities for exhibitionpurposes, while another of the
highest rank may have very little materialto show.Historically and
actually, the general Land Office is one ofthe great Bureaus of our
Government, but to an exposition it can onlycontribute maps; and these,
being made mainly for one set of purposes,only in limited variety. 
Accordingly, the exhibit at Omaha was small,and the aim of its organizer,
Mr. F. P. Metzger, was to make it locallyinteresting, and artistically
attractive.It consisted of a handsomelymahogany case, about 812 by 7 feet
and 8 feet high, upon whose sides fourlarge maps, executed by hand, were
installed.These were, first, theLand Office map of the United States,
showing our successive accretionsof territory; secondly, a map of Nebraska;
third, a copy of the originaltownship plat of Omaha; and fourth, a facsimile
of the first land patentever issued to a citizen of Nebraska, which covered,
as it happens, thesite of the Exposition itself.These maps were
attractively presented,and received much attention.The total cost of the
exhibit was $507.50,exclusive of freight charges.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.</p>

<p>The exhibit of this Bureau at Omaha covered about the same ground as
at Atlanta and Nashville.Indian Schools--day schools and boardingschools,
on and off reservations--furnished specimens of the work done byIndian
pupils in their class rooms and shops.A smaller number ofschools were
represented than heretofore, so that the facilities and workmight be more
fully seen.</p>

<p>In order to put appropriate decorative effects into the exhibit,both
to arrest the attention and announce the fact that Indian educationwas being
exploited, there was added to the work of the schools specimensof Indian
aboriginal work, plaques, pottery, blankets, sashes, baskets,stone pipes,
and rush matting.The good design and skillful workmanshipdisplayed in such
articles showed the native ability as distinguishedfrom the ability acquired
through the training of the schools, thefruitful soil in which seeds of
education are sown.</p>

<p>The unusually effective and artistic installation of the exhibit was
the work of Miss Alice C. Fletcher, whose aim was to make it so expressthese
two ideas that visitors could not fail to recognize the nativecapacity upon
which the Government bestows education according to ourconceptions.</p>

<p>On the main aisle, at the two corners of the long narrow space
assigned to the Bureau, were life-size figures, in complete Indiancostume,
of a Sioux warrior and a Sioux woman with her baby, kindlyloaned by the
Smithsonian institution.Between them stood a small caseof finest needle
work, and infants wardrobe, lace, made in the laceschools for Indian women,
loaned by Miss Sybil Carter, and drawn-workfrom California Indians.Looking
down to the opposite end of the space,a glimpse was had of charming color
effects in the cozy-corner, with itscouches and cousine covered with Navajo
blankets, its Moqui draperies andplaques and its walls hung with pictures
above a dado of Chippewa rushmattings.Among the pictures, which were
mostly photographs of Indiansand Indian school-life,were three "studies" in
oil, of Indian life, twoheads,and a deserted medicine lodge, loanedby the
artists, AngelDecora, a young Winnepeg, whom is a pupil of Howard Pyle and
gave promiseof unusual ability.Added to those characteristic decorations
were largeand handsome basketollas from Arkansas, shapely vases of Pueblo
ware anda case containing baskets, pottery, articles made from red
pipe-stone,etc., while high over all hung a Chippewa bark canoe.</p>

<p>The main exhibit, of which this was the setting, consisted ofsamples
of the regular work of Indian pupils, such as would show the aim,scope, and
success of the Indian schools, both intellectually andindustrially.The
training given in domestic arts and farm work could beindicated only by
photographs; but the trades were well represented. There was blacksmith and
wheelwright work, from a bolt to a farm wagon;woodwork, from sloyd to a
finely finished cabinet; leather, from thesewing together of two pieces to a
complete set of harness and well-madeshoes; needlework, from patchwork and
darning to complete suits for menand women.Tinsmithing, printing, and
painting were also shown, andmodeling in clay by little fingers in the
kindergartens.</p>

<p>A label on each article gave the name, age, and experience of the
Indian worker, and small framed placards gave brief sketches of the schools
represented, also general statistics as to the work of education and
civilization carried on by the Government among the Indians generally.</p>

<p>Four cases of school-room papers mounted on cardboard and set in
swinging frames, unglazed, covered the entire course of study in Indian
schools from kindergarten exercises and first attempts in English, to
geometry, physics, book-keeping, type-writing and stenography.There was
also a column of swinging frames, glazed filled with photographs giving
exterior and interior views of schools; also graphic statistics as therecord
of returned students.</p>

<p>Two chairs invited weary visitors to linger beside a table uponwhich
were sets of floor plans and elevations of school buildings, albumsof
photographs and files of monthly and weekly papers published andprinted by
various schools.</p>

<p>The schools represented in the exhibit were- Non-reservation schools
at Genoa, Nebraska; Lawrence, Kansas, (Haskell Institute); Carlisle ,
Pennsylvania, and Carson, Nevada.Reservation boarding schools asfollows: 
Winnebago in Nebraska; Segar Colony and Riverside (Kiowa) inOklahoma; Oneida
in Wisconsin; Crow Creek in South Dakota; and HoopaValley in California;
also day schools on the Pine Ridge and Rosebudreservations in South Dakota,
and among the Mission Indians inCalifornia.The school at Phoenix, Arizona,
was also represented by aredwood cabinet and band stand model, included in
previous exhibits.</p>

<p>On the whole, this was the best presentation of Indian school yetmade
at an Exposition and by far the best installation of materialgathered.</p>

<p>The expenditures in behalf of the Bureau of Indian Affairs were as
follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Labor and services,-----------------------------$ 140.00</span>
<span class="l">Travel and subsistence,-------------------------248.89</span>

<p>BUREAU OF EDUCATION</p>

<p>The prime purpose of the Bureau of Education is the collection and
diffusion of educational information, but it is also charged by Congresswith
the administration of the schools of Alaska and with a limitedsupervision of
the expenditures for the land-grant colleges under theMorrill Act of 1890. 
While the first of these is the most important andfar-reaching, it is the
most difficult to show in an exhibit; the last,while important in itself, is
but a small part of the Bureau's work anddoes not require very extensive
illustration.The work which relates toAlaska has within it the germs of
wide development, but up to this timeit cannot be said to be comparable in
extent or important with theeducational systems of either of the States, or
with the other work ofthe Bureau itself.Nevertheless, the peculiar
conditions of education inthat territory and its population by races so
entirely different inhabits, customs, and dress from our own, make the
Alaskan side of thework peculiarly useful for exhibition purposes.</p>

<p>About half of the space allotted to the Bureau, therefore, wasdevoted
to material illustrating the conditions of life and of educationin Alaska,
while the remaining half was nearly equally divided betweenthe exhibits of
land-grant colleges and the statistical and othermaterial intended to
"diffuse educational information" of a generalcharacter.The material of
the last class will be described first.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous statistical feature of the exhibit was a large
wall chart, four feet wide and ten feet high, on which was set forth the
progress of education in twenty years in the North Central division ofthe
United States.In a series of wing frames nearby were forty smallercharts
showing educational statistics of a miscellaneous character. These were all
done in bright colors with graphic diagrams in greatvariety so that the
striking appearance of the charts themselves mightattract attention to the
statistics presented.Many of the charts wereof special local interest,
though such as could not be easily preparedexcept in the Bureau of
Education.The local sheets were placedconspicuously, in order to strike
the attention of the visitor and leadhim to examine the others.Two cases
mounted on the wall contained eightmaps, which showed the distribution of
educational agencies andconditions in the United States.They were devoted
respectively topublic schools, secondary schools; colleges and universities;
schools ofmedicine, of dentistry, of pharmacy; schools of theology and of
law;normal schools; public libraries; and illiteracy.The cases used for
these maps, as well as the maps themselves, were those used at the two
previous expositions and have been described in reports on the Exhibitsof
the Bureau at the time.</p>

<p>The remaining wall space was occupied by pictures of historical
schools punishments and of school buildings.The first of series ofthese
comprised twenty water colors by Mr. Felix E. Mahoney, andillustrated
spanking, shaking, horsing, the Eton block, standing on onefoot, the dunce
cap, the bastinado, etc.The other series were also inwater color and were
executed by Mr. Spencer B. Nichols.They showed thedevelopment of school
architecture, and included the log cabin school,the interior of the same, a
prairie "dug-out", the little red school-house, a city school of thirty years
ago, and a modern school building.
A set of the publications of the Bureau was placed in a revolvingbook
case in a prominent place. They showed to casual visitors thevariety and
extent of the work of the Bureau and were frequently used forreference.</p>

<p>The data intended to be read in the exhibit itself were supplemented
by a ten-page folder containing facts relating to education, which was
gratuitously distributed.The information in this folder was of the sort
most likely to be appreciated by general readers, and its distributionwas,
in the opinion of the undersigned, the most substantial andsatisfactory
innovation in this exhibit.Eleven thousand five hundred ofthe circulars
were distributed, and though a great many of them werewasted as might have
been expected, there was seen repeated evidence ofvaluable results from the
distribution.</p>

<p>The presentation of the land-grant colleges consisted of acollection
of the publications of those institutions and a series ofcabinets containing
photographs, charts, and drawings illustrating them. There was twelve of the
cabinets and the colleges represented were:</p>

<p>The Universities of Arizona, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, Nevada, Tennessee, and Wyoming; Maryland Agricultural College;
Massachusetts Agricultural College; Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology;
Michigan Agricultural College; Montana Agricultural College;New Hampshire
College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts; RutgersScientific School;
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas;Agricultural College of Utah;
Alabama Normal and Industrial College forColored Students; Southern
University and Agricultural and MechanicalCollege; North Carolina
Agricultural and Mechanical College for theColored Race; South Carolina
Agricultural College for Colored Students; Hampton Normal and Agricultural
Institute; Florida Normal and IndustrialCollege.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the Alaskan collection occupied half of thespace
of the exhibit; in attractiveness and in the number of visitors whowere
impressed by it, it outweighed the other portions.The specimenswere
collected by Dr. Sheldon Jackson, the General Agent of Education inAlaska,
and a large portion of them were his property, which he kindlyloaned for the
display.A unique feature of the educational effort inbehalf of Alaska is
the introduction of the reindeer, by means of whichit is hoped to transform
the natives from a migratory to a pastoralpeople and thus make their
civilization and education easier.Inillustration of this work a large
reindeer with a sled and lay figure ofa native driver were mounted in the
most conspicuous position in theexhibit.Near it was a large case
containing six lay figures clothedwith typical Alaskan costumes, made of
fur, fish skin, bird skins, buck-skin, etc.Another case showed a collection
of birds from Bering Sea,mounted on imitation rockwork.A miscellaneous
collection ofethnological specimens consisting of bows, arrows, harpoons,
implements,carvings, masks, fish-traps, boats, houses, etc., filled four
other casesand formed the body of the Alaskan exhibit.The formal work of
educationwas illustrated by photographs mounted in wing frames, of
buildings,classes and teachers, specimens of drawings, penmanship, etc., and
bystatistics.</p>

<p>In the manner of installation it cannot be said that any especially
new devices were adopted.Furniture already on hand was used for the
statistical charts, the pictures of the Alaskan schools, and thephotographs
of land-grant colleges.Three of the cases used for theAlaskan specimens
had been made for this occasion, being designed for thespecial purposes
which they served.</p>

<p>GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.</p>

<p>In the preparation for its exhibit for the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition, the Geological Survey was seriously hampered intwo
ways.First, by lack of adequate space, and the irregular shape ofthe space
occupied; and second, by the want of suitable windows in whichto display its
characteristic photographic transparencies.The latterdefect was partly
obviated in the following manner:the Corner of thespace was the corner of
two main aisles of the Government building, andhere was erected an octagonal
tower of mahogany-finished wood, 7 feet indiameter and 12 feet high.The
lower half of this was finished inpaneling, and the upper half, surmounted
by a solid pyramidal cap, wasfinished as a frame-work in which sixteen large
transparencies were set,as if forming the sides of a lantern.Within this
frame-work was placeda battery of electric lights, and in this way the
transparencies, whichrelated to Yellowstone National Park, were fairly well
illuminated. Theentire structure formed an essential feature of the exhibit
upon itsdecorative side.Flanking the tower were two large cases of
geologicalmaterial from the Yellowstone Park, and behind it, supported by a
mahogany screen, was placed a large relief map of the Park, which wasmade
expressly for this occasion from data furnished by official surveys.</p>

<p>The remainder of the floor space was occupied by two large cases of
minerals, and one of fossils, selected rather for their popular interestthan
for scientific purposes, and by a group of relief maps andgeological models
which were chosen to illustrate the different forms andscales which are
given to this class of objects.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Survey had a reasonably large amount of wall spaceat
its disposal, and upon this, other relief models, geological and
topographical maps, and illustrations form official publications were
displayed.This map exhibit, which formed a general background for the
entire display, was exceedingly varied and effective.One of the reliefmaps
thus shown represented the State of Nebraska, and this attracted agreat deal
of attention.On the whole, however, the Survey exhibit, wasone of the
smallest it has ever made.</p>

<p>On account of the Geological Survey exhibit, the following sums were
expended:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Labor and services,---------------------------$345.00</span>
<span class="l">Travel and subsistence,-----------------------295.17</span>

<p>REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE

of the

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.</p>

<p>The space allotted to the Department of Agriculture in the Government building
at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition was 4,716 square feet. 
This amounted to, practically, a space about 43 feet wide by 112 feet long,
occupying a portion of the South wing of the building, and located on the East
side of the aisle adjoining the Treasury Department space on the North.A rear
aisle 7 feet wide divided the space into two sections, that between the aisle
and the wall and the wall being treated on the alcove system.Nine Bureaus and
divisions of the Department were represented in this exhibit, the Weather
Bureau and the Bureau of Animal Industry being given blocks of space on either
end of the grand space, with 20 feet frontage on the main aisle and running
back to the wall.The exhibits of the Divisions of Pomology, Entomology and
Chemistry were placed between these two exhibits on the main aisle, while the
exhibit of the Office of Fiber Investigations, and the Division of Forestry,
Botany and Vegetable Physiology were placed in the alcoves fronting on the rear
aisle.</p>

<p>The style of installation adopted was similar to that employed at the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition of 1897.The wood work and case material being ebonized,
with buff interior finish.As a whole, the exhibit was better selected than
that shown at the Tennessee Exposition, the space being somewhat larger,
several new features being added.The labeling was uniform in style with that
employed at the two previous expositions.The buff, National Museum card-board
being used.</p>

<p>The object of the exhibit as an entirety, was to show the scope and character
of the world of the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>The exhibit scheme was admirably carried out, the work of preparation being
under my supervision, as Representative of the Department.In this work of
preparation, I was assisted by Mr. Charles Richards Dodge, at that time in
charge of the Office of Fiber Investigations, who afterwards, as the Assistant
Representative, installed the exhibit at the Exposition.The construction of
case material and wood work of the space was under the supervision of Mr.
William Halley, of the Department, and Mr. Jasper A. Wilson was in charge of
the Exhibit from June 25 to October 1.The exhibit, by Divisions, may be
described as follows:</p>

<p>Weather Bureau.</p>

<p>The exhibit of the Weather Bureau was one of the most complete thus far made,
and comprised a forecast and map-printing section, from which daily weather
maps were issued by the Chalk-plate process which was exhibited for the first
time.Telegraphs reports from a large number of stations were received daily
at the Exposition, and all the operations required in the preparation and
printing of the weather map were carried out, daily, in the presence of
visitors.Copies of the printed maps were distributed to those interested.In
addition to this interesting feature of the exhibition, a large collection of
charts were shown, giving the important climatic features of the United States,
such as the mean annual and seasonal temperatures, rainfall, pressure,
humidity, etc.Numerous enlarged photographic prints illustrated remarkable
cloud effects, lightning flashes, etc.</p>

<p>By way of illustrating the apparatus and instruments employed in making
meteorological observations, the exhibit comprised a complete collection of the
Standard self-recording instruments, all of which were properly connected
electrically with the necessary mechanism outside, producing thereby continuous
and automatic records during the entire period of the Exposition, of the
velocity and direction of the wind, the duration of sunshine, the amount and
rapidity of rainfall, and the temperature and pressure of the air.This
instrumental apparatus was supplemented by an exhibit of the Weather Bureau
kites recently employed for the purpose of securing automatic records of the
meteorological conditions prevailing at great heights in the free air.A full
size model kite, with the large reel and wire employed to flying the same, were
on exhibit, and the kite work was further illustrated by numerous photographic
enlargements of various forms of kites, instruments, etc.</p>

<p>Trained officials were in attendance for the purpose of fully explaining the
operations of the instruments and the work of the Bureau in general.</p>

<p>This exhibit was under the immediate supervision of Prof. C.F. Marvin, who
personally directed its installation.During the Exposition, Mr. L.A. Welsh,
Local Forecaster at Omaha, was in charge, assisted by Mr. A.B. Wallaber, and
Mr. Frank E. Pyne.</p>

<p>Division of Pomology.</p>

<p>The exhibit of fruit models made by the Division of Pomology was planned with
the view of furnishing information to observant visitors in regard to the
appearance and varietal characteristics of important fruits.One group
illustrated the principal commercial varieties of apples adapted to dessert and
home use in the same region, while another was composed of Russian varieties
and crabs.Still another group contained specimens of new and little-known
varieties of the apple from various portions of the United States.A
miscellaneous collection contained specimens of the leading commercial and
dessert fruits of the United States.</p>

<p>A large collection of water-color paintings, photographs, and descriptive
sheets illustrating the methods of fruit description practiced in the Division
was also shown.</p>

<p>A special feature of the exhibit was a collection of sun-dried and evaporated
fruits of the United States, illustrating the commercial grading and packing of
such fruits for market.This collecting contained about 200 specimen packages
and 32 commercial packages.The preparation of this exhibit was in charge of
Col. G.B. Brackett, assisted by Mr. Wm. A. Taylor and Mr. W.N. Irwin.</p>

<p>Division of Entomology.</p>

<p>In planning the exhibit of applied entomology, it was recognized that, while
visitors might be expected from all parts of the country, a majority of those
whose interests were directly connected with agriculture and horticulture would
come from the more immediate vicinity of Omaha.The exhibit was therefore
designed especially for this class of visitors, and the insect enemies of crops
peculiar to the cotton belt or of the sub-tropical fruits of our Southern
States and Pacific Coast were excluded, the entire space allotted to the
Division of Entomology being occupied with a collection of exhibits
representing the insects, and the nature of the injury caused by them,
characteristic of the great corn and wheat belt of the upper Mississippi
Valley.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the material, it was borne in mind that while farmers may
be familiar with the appearance of the principal injurious insects which affect
their crops in the stage in which their most serious depredations are
committed, yet comparatively few recognize these same insects in any other of
the different stages through which they pass in the course of their lives, a
knowledge of which is very important from an economic point of view, and
particularly in the matter of an intelligent application of the remedies.The
exhibit of each insect was therefore designed to illustrate its life history
and habits, and to contain examples so far as possible, of its different
stages.</p>

<p>In description of each exhibit, the common name as well as the scientific name
of the insect was given, and a brief indication of the remedies to be employed
against it, and also the references to the published accounts of the life
history and habits.</p>

<p>To facilitate a ready discovery of any particular species that might interest
the visitor, the various insects exhibited were grouped in accordance with the
different plants which they infest, and were minutely classified in accordance
with the part of the plant which they attack, whether the leaves, fruit, trunk,
or roots.</p>

<p>The growing importance of the sugar beet industry of the region specified, led
to the formation of a special exhibit of insects known to depredate this plant,
some fifty-two destructive species of insects being shown.In addition there
were exhibited colored engravings of the European insect enemies of the sugar
beet.</p>

<p>The scope of the exhibit is indicated by the following list of host plants and
insects, showing a total of 435 different insects attacking some 21 different
kinds of cultivated plants:</p>

<p>Food Plants,Numbers of kinds of Insects.</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Corn 128</span>
<span class="l">Sugar Cane 3</span>
<span class="l">Rice 4</span>

<span class="l">Apple 35</span>
<span class="l">Pear 6</span>
<span class="l">Peach 10</span>
<span class="l">Plum 4</span></span>

<p>In addition to the above there was exhibited a series of insects which are
common household pests, and four boxes devoted to the scale insect enemies of
fruit trees; the latter was specifically prepared to enable any one interested
to familiarize himself with the common scale insects and especially to
recognize the destructive San Jose scale and distinguish the latter from its
close allies.</p>

<p>The insects enemies of Indian corn naturally found a prominent place in the
exhibit, and a was model of a full grown hill of corn was used as an attractive
center piece and also to illustrate the work of the corn worm of boll worm, as
well as many other corn insects.</p>

<p>As supplementing the indication of remedies given under each insect, an exhibit
was made of the more important insecticides, each being accompanied with a
printed card giving full directions for the preparation and application of the
mixture.</p>

<p>This exhibit was prepared by Dr. L.C. Howard, Entomologist, and a corps of
assistants from the Division.</p>

<p>Division of Chemistry.</p>

<p>The space allotted to the Division of Chemistry was almost entirely devoted to
an exhibit illustrating the history, processes and products of the beet-sugar
industry in the United States.The historical collection included samples of
the products of several of the older factories, some of which are still in
operation, notably the factory at Alvarado, California, while others failed to
overcome the obstacles attending the conduct of a new enterprise. Photographs
of those earlier factories, as far as obtainable, as well as those of most of
the factories now active, were enlarged by the bromide process and exhibited in
suitable frames, supported on screens constructed for the purpose.</p>


<p>In addition to photographs of historical interests, the series contained many
illustrations of planting, thinning, cultivating, harvesting and other field
operations, necessary for the production of sugar-beets of a quality suitable
for the successful manufacture of sugar.</p>

<p>One of the indispensable adjuncts of the industry is the continued careful
selection of the beets which are to produce the seeds, from which future crops
are to be grown.This is important for the improvement of the quality of the
beet and is necessary in order that its quality may be maintained at its
present standard.Certain typical characters of standard varieties of beets
illustrated by the exhibition of carefully wrought models and by samples of
beets preserved in a solution of formaldehyde.The methods employed on seed
farms for the sampling and analysis of "mother beets" were illustrated by
photographs and by a collection of many of the forms of apparatus in use for
that purpose.</p>

<p>Another collection showed the appearance of the sliced beets; the best pulp of
residue remaining after the sugar has been extracted; massecuite; first and
second sugars; final molasses, and other products of the best-sugar factory. 
The machinery used in the manufacture of these various products was illustrated
by a series of photographs taken in the various factories of the United States.</p>

<p>One case of the exhibit was filled with standard forms of apparatus used in the
analysis of beets, the various factory products and the raw materials used in
the manufacture of beet-sugar.</p>

<p>A conspicuous feature of the exhibit was a large wall map showing ;the
locations of beet-sugar factories in operation in the United States and also
those proposed, many of which have since been built.The map also showed the
areas, probably suited by climatic conditions, for the successful growth of
sugar-beets.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous work of the Division was illustrated by a complete collection
of its publications, numbering at that time more than fifty bulletins and
circulars.</p>

<p>The exhibit was planned , assembled, prepared and installedby Dr. G.L.
Spencer, under the direction of Dr. H.W. Wiley, the Chief of the Division.</p>

<p>Bureau of Animal Industry.</p>

<p>The microscopic inspection of the Bureau was illustrated by a practical
demonstration of the manner in which this is conducted at the various packing
centers in the United States.Four assistant Microscopists were detailed from
the Bureau force at South Omaha, Nebraska, and were daily engaged in making
examinations of pork samples furnished them every day from packing houses at
South Omaha.The microscope and other appliances were like those used
elsewhere for this purpose.On one table a microscope with specimens of pork
infected with trichinae for inspection of visitors was shown, and another
Assistant Microscopist was designated to explain the preparation under the
microscope and tell how the work is performed.</p>

<p>Several models of vats for dipping sheep to rid them of the disease known as
scabies or sheep scab, were exhibited.One of them consisted of a circular
yard and vat attached, being a model of a form used in Australia for dipping
sheep, and is especially adapted to handling large bands or flocks containing
several thousand sheep.Smaller vats with draining yard attached, for dipping
small flock of sheep, were shown also an oblong vat arrangement for a double
swim.This arrangement does away with the expense of constructing a circular
vat and yet enables the operator to keep the sheep in the dip as long as he
wishes.In this space a model sheep dipping vat used at Chicago, Illinois, was
shown, this model being furnished by the courtesy of the Union Stock yard and
Transit Company of that city.The triple swim of this vat is an interesting
feature.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of the Fort Worth Stock Yards Company, W.E. Skinner, Manager, a
model of their vat and yarding pens attached for dipping cattle to free them
from ticks, was exhibited.</p>

<p>The exhibit of the Dairy Division consisted mainly of an object lesson in the
composition of milk and its products.A gallon of milk, a tub of butter and a
small cheese were shown, with the component parts of each, displayed in sets of
glass jars.Each set comprised the water, fat, casein, sugar, and mineral
matter contained in the subject named.Cream, skim-milk, butter-milk and
condensed milk, were treated in the same way.In addition, attractive samples
of the by-products of the dairy were shown, sugar-of-milk in different
forms--dried casein and beverages made of whey.Also a collection of packages
for marketing butter in various foreign countries, as well as in our own.</p>

<p>An exhibit of a hen with several chickens affected with gape-worm disease
showed the characteristic symptoms.Alcoholic specimens of the gape-worms in
position in the trachea and drawings of the parasites were shown in the same
connection.</p>

<p>A case containing models of horses' feet, with various kinds of horse shoes,
and pathological specimens of diseases resulting from improper shoeing, was
exhibited; also models of diseased organs as seen in animals affected with
certain infectious diseases, such as the lungs of cattle affected with
contagious pleuro-pneumonia, and nasal septum of a horse affected with
glanders, and several organs of cattle affected with rinderpest.</p>

<p>Numerous pathological specimens in alcohol of diseased organs and parts of
organs were exhibited, illustrating the lesions found in animals affected with
various diseases.Among them were tuberculosis, Texas fever and actinomycosis
of cattle, glanders and "leeches" of horses, and tuberculosis, hog cholera and
swine plague of swine.In hermetically sealed glass tubes were exhibited pure
cultures of several species of bacteria which are pathogenic for the lower
animals.These showed the characteristic growth of the colonies, their color
and general appearance.</p>

<p>Several toxins and anti-toxins prepared in the Biochemic laboratory of the
Bureau, with specimens of mallein and tuberculin used for the diagnosis of
glanders in horses and tuberculosis in cattle were exhibited.The instruments
used in injecting the black-leg vaccine prepared and distributed by the
Pathological Division of the Bureau were exhibited, with a quantity of the
vaccine in bulk, showing its appearance.</p>

<p>On the walls of the space devoted to the Bureau exhibit were photographs
illustrating the transportation of horses and cattle by ocean steamers from the
United States to foreign countries, and the manner in which they are received
and sold in such countries.This collection included a photograph of the
Animal Quarantine Station of this Department for the port of New York, located
at Garfield, New Jersey, where cattle, sheep and swine, imported from European
countries, are held in quarantine in accordance with the Department
regulations.The Texas fever district, or portion of the United States
permanently infected by that disease, was shown by a colored man with a line
drawn to represent the district from which no cattle can be transported during
nearly nine months of the year, except for immediate slaughter and under the
regulations of the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>A framed copy of the famous proclamation issued by the late Hon. J.M. Rusk,
ex-Secretary of Agriculture, on September 26, 1892, declaring the United States
to be free from contagious pleuro-pneumonia of cattle was exhibited.Since
that date no case of this disease has appeared in this country.</p>

<p>Dr. A.M. Farrington prepared this exhibit, and superintended its installation.
the dairy exhibit of this Bureau was prepared by Major H.E. Alvord, Chief of
the Dairy Division.</p>

<p>Division of Botany.</p>

<p>The Division of Botany confined its exhibit to two of the important lines of
the work which it is conducting, poisonous plants and pure seed investigations,
the largest part being devoted to the latter.</p>

<p>Poisonous plants were represented by about fifty pressed and mounted specimens
and several photographs of the most important poisonous plants of the United
States.These were all labeled with their common and technical names and
information in regard to their distribution, the character of their poisonous
effects and the best remedies.This exhibit was prepared by Mr. V.K. Chesnut
who has charge of poisonous plant investigations in the Department.</p>

<p>The exhibit devoted to pure seed investigations consisted of a standard
germinating chamber and samples of most of the apparatus used in the seed
laboratory for testing seeds, wax models (enlarged) of the most common
impurities, machines and illustrations showing some of the best types of seed
cleaning machinery in use in the United States and Europe.All if the articles
were plainly labeled with information in regard to their use or connection with
see investigations.</p>

<p>Mr. Leicester H. Dewey had immediate charge of the preparation and installation
of this exhibit.</p>

<p>Division of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology.</p>

<p>The mushroom exhibit of this Division consisted of collections of specimens,
models, drawings, paintings, and photographs illustrating the habits of growth
and appearance of the different genera and species of wild edible and poisonous
mushrooms.The growing and handling of mushrooms commercially was illustrated
by means of a cross section of a cellar showing two styles of beds, their
construction and preparation, the two kinds of spawn in general use and the way
in which the beds are spawned and later top-dressed with soil.Models of
mushrooms in different stages of development were shown as they appear in the
beds.The picking, packing, and marketing of the crops was illustrated by
means of apparatus models, drawings, paintings, and photographs.The bulletins
of the Department relating to mushrooms and their culture were also shown. 
This exhibit proved to be of special interest to large numbers of those who
visited the Exposition and was prepared by Mr. P.H. Dorsett, who superintended
its installation.</p>

<p>Division of Forestry.</p>

<p>The following is a catalogue of the exhibit of the Division of Forestry:</p>

<p>1.Monographic display of four important commercial timber species; White Pine
(Pinus strobus), Bull Pine (Pinus ponderosa), White Fir (Abies concolor),
Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga texifolia).Each monograph exhibited the
characteristic appearance of the tree trunk in a monster frame of the wood with
perfect bark attached.Five interior panels showed successively, (a) the
geographical range of the species; (b) its common and scientific synonymy, with
principal uses, character and quality of the wood, together with
photomicrographs of the magnified structure; (c) the botanical characteristics
by mature foliage and fruit; (d) appearance of the various cuts of finished and
commercial wood; and (e) rough sawn lumber and cross section of young and
mature trunks with bark intact.</p>

<p>2.Forest botanical display of representative North American forest trees,
comprising one hundred and fourteen species.Each species was illustrated by
mounted herbarium specimens of flowers, mature foliage and fruit; accompanied
also by a small map showing geographical range of the species and notes on the
characteristic features and important commercial uses of the wood.A small
block showed the general appearance of the wood and bark.</p>

<p>3.Models of a farm showed, (a) the devastation consequent upon indiscriminate
cutting and other destruction of farm forest cover; (b) the method of restoring
the forest cover where needed and recuperating the wasted soil;(c) rational
utilization and proper disposition of the farm forest.</p>

<p>4.Forest planting on the North Tract of the Exposition ground, West of the
Transportation and Agricultural Implement Building, comprised the Government
outdoor forestry exhibit, consisting of six plats of ground (48 by 56 feet). 
They illustrated by actual forest planting, the various methods of combining,
under forestry principles, useful tree species, in the planting operations
being carried on by the Department of Agriculture at a large number of
Experiment stations, especially in the treeless West and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The preparation and installation of this exhibit was in charge of Mr. George B.
Sudworth, Dendrologist of the Division.</p>

<p>Office of Fiber Investigations.</p>

<p>In this exhibit was presented the leading varieties of commercial flax and hemp
of the world, either grown in, of imported into the United States, particular
attention being called to the superb samples of flax from Pregon and the Puget
Sound region of the State of Washington.The exhibit was as follows:</p>

<p>Virginia flax, illustrating the household industry; Michigan commercial flax;
high-grade flax produced by the experiments of the Office of Fiber
Investigations in the State of Washington; fine flax produced by the
experiments of the Office of Fiber Investigations in the State of Washington;

<p>REPORT of the REPRESENTATIVE

of the

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION AND NATIONAL MUSEUM.</p>

<p>Under the authorization contained in the Act of Congress hereinbefore quoted,
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution designated Dr. F.W. True,
Executive Curator of the National Museum, to act as Representative of the
Institution and its dependencies on the Board of Management of the Government
Exhibit, and Mr. W.V. Cox, Chief Clerk of the National Museum, to take active
charge of the exhibits, at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>

<p>All the dependencies of the Institution were represented by displays at the
Exposition.</p>

<p>The space assigned to the Institution was located in the East Central part of
the Government building, and comprised about 4,000 square feet.The frontage
on the main aisle was about 84 feet, and the depth 42 feet.</p>

<p>The exhibit was planned to give a general idea of the scope and character of
the Institution and its several bureaus.For obvious reasons, the activities
of the National Museum were more thoroughly illustrated than those of other
bureaus, the majority of which are engaged in work whose character is scarcely
to be elucidated by displays of objects.</p>

<p>From the following brief account of the exhibit, it will be noted that the
exhibit was, as intended, more a representation of the nature of the work
carried on at Washington than an exhaustive collection of specimens, which
would have been impossible in view of the small area of space available.The
systems employed by the Institution in classification, mounting and labeling
and general installation were shown to the best possible advantage.Every
consideration was given to promote the facility of the publicin examining,
studying and comparing the articles presented; brief explanatory noted included
on each label; the best quality of plate glass was used exclusively to avoid
visual distortion and counter-reflection.The cases,--with the exception of
those specially built for the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution proper,
and the stationary wall cases,--were of uniform dimensions (units), and
finished in every instance in a substantial and attractive style; while a
pleasing color scheme was maintained throughout the entire display.</p>

<p>Smithsonian Institution Proper.</p>

<p>The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution proper, occupying a quadrant under
the dome of the building, was as follows:</p>
<p>
A complete set of the publications of the Institution and its bureaus.(In
special upright case.)</p>

<p>A case of the bronze tablet recently placed on the tomb of Smithson in Genoa,
Italy.(In front of the same case.)</p>

<p>Personal relics of Smithson:Photographic copies of the title-pages of his
more important papers; the seal of the Institution; a picture of the
Smithsonian building.(In a table case.)</p>

<p>Copies of the history of the first half-century of the Smithsonian Institution,
in different bindings; title page and illustrations for the same.(In table
case.)</p>

<p>The Hodgins Fund:Silver and bronze medals; copies of publications; portrait
of Thomas G. Hodgkins, who bequeathed the fund to the Smithsonian Institution
in 1891, for use in promoting researches in Atmospheric air.(In a table
case.)</p>

<p>Two large photographs of the Aerodrome of Professor Langley.</p>

<p>Framed portraits of the Secretaries of the Smithsonian Institution, Joseph
Henry, (1846-1878); Spencer Fullerton Baird, (1878-1887); Samuel Pierpont
Langley, (elected 1887).</p>

<p>The exhibit of the Smithsonian proper was selected under the direction of the
Secretary, by Assistant Secretary Richard Rathburn.</p>

<p>Bureau of American Ethnology.</p>

<p>This bureau exhibited three large panels of selected illustrations from its
annual Reports, showing the scope of the work.A set of the Bureau's Reports
were included in the case containing the publications of the Smithsonian
Institution and its dependencies.</p>

<p>The exhibit was assembled by Mr. W.J. McGee, Ethnologist in Charge, under the
supervision of Major J.W. Powell, Director of the Bureau.</p>

<p>At the Indian Congress held in conjunction with the Exposition, a miniature
Kiowa Indian camping circle was exhibited by the Bureau under the charge of Mr.
James Mooney, who collected the material for the same.</p>

<p>National Zoological Park.</p>

<p>The exhibit of the National Zoological Park consisted of a model of the Park
showing its topography, wooded areas, animal houses and enclosures, water color
and pen-and-ink sketches of animal houses and picturesque points in the Park;
and transparencies from photographs of characteristic features of the Park.</p>

<p>This exhibit was assembled by Dr. Frank Baker, Superintendent of the Park.</p>

<p>Bureau of International Exchanges.</p>

<p>This Bureau exhibited a map showing the distribution of its correspondents
throughout the world, and a graphic chart indicating the growth of the service
by decades since the year 1850.</p>

<p>The exhibit was prepared by Mr. W.I. Adams, Chief Clerk of the Bureau, under
the direction of the Secretary of the Institution.</p>

<p>Astrophysical Observatory.</p>

<p>The exhibit of the Astrophysical Observatory was selected and prepared under
the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.The following
objects were included.</p>

<p>Photographs of the exterior and interior of the Observatory building; the
bolometer, or electric thermometer, and instrument of extreme delicacy, and the
invention of Professor Langley; photographs of other instruments in the
observatory, such as the siderostat, galvanometer, and spectrometer; and
enlarged photographs of the spectrum of the sun.</p>

<p>National Museum.</p>

<p>In the organization of the exhibit of the National Museum, two principal
objects were kept in view:</p>

<p>First:To indicate the comprehensiveness of the scope of the Museum.</p>

<p>Second:To represent the manner in which series of objects are arranged,
labeled and displayed in the Museum building at Washington.</p>

<p>In carrying out the first idea, only an outline could be presented owing to the
lack of space.</p>

<p>As regards the second, it should be remarked that the cases, fittings and
labels employed were for the most part from the regular stock of the Museum and
were of exactly the same style as those in Washington.A few new methods,
regarded as improvements, were introduced.</p>

<p>The Museum is divided into three departments, each of which is again subdivided
into divisions and sections.The exhibits are here given by departments.</p>

<p>Department of Anthropology.--The exhibit of this department of the Museum was
planned and prepared by Mr. W.H. Holmes, Head Curator, assisted by Professor
Otis T. Mason, Curator, and Dr. Hough, Assistant Curator, Division of
Enthnology; Mr. J.E. Watkins, Curator, Division of Mechanical Technology, and
Mr. George C. Maynard, Custodian, Section of Electricity; Mr. Thomas Wilson,
Division of Prehistoric Archaeology; Dr. Cyrus Alder, Honorary Assistant
Curator, and Dr. I.M. Sassanowicz, Aid, Division of Historic Archaeology; and
Mr. T.W. Smillie, Custodian Section of Photography, Mr. Joseph Palmer, Modeler,
and Mr. T.W. Sweeney, preparator, assisted in the preparation and installation
of the exhibit.</p>

<p>The exhibit occupied nineteen cases nearest the rotunda of the Government
building.The principal functions of this department of the Museum are to
preserve and study the varied phenomena of man and culture, and especially to
present to the public by means of exhibits the leading facts of human effort
and progress.</p>

<p>Naturally, much attention was given to the native American peoples and culture,
and to our own national history, but a clear and symmetrical presentation of
race history calls for illustrations from the whole field of anthropology, and
all times and all races were to contribute.</p>

<p>The group of exhibits presented at the Exposition was intended to illustrate
the achievements of the race along a few of the more important lines of
activity.Each series of objects epitomized the subject treated, and presented
the leading steps of progress in the simplest manner.</p>

<p>The subjects were as follows:</p>

<p>Fire Making and Illumination.--The discovery of the use of fire and the making
of fire by artificial means was illustrated by a single series of objects.The
story began with the fire of volcanoes and lightning, followed by the kindling
and keeping of fire, and closed with the utilization of the electric spark. 
Illumination was represented in two series:(1) the torch, (2) the lamp.</p>

<p>Tools of General use.--The tools and utensils employed by men in the various
arts were arranged in series, beginning with the simplest and ending with the
highest forms.Tools of general use were illustrated in eight series, as
follows:The hammer, the axe, (American), the adz, the knife, the saw, the
drill, the scraper.</p>

<p>Weapons- Weapons have performed an important part in the history of man and
culture, and the steps that lead up from the stone and club in the hand to the
steel sword and machine gun were strikingly suggested in two series presented:</p>

<p>(1)weapons for use in the hand-piercing and slashing weapons.</p>
<p>(2)projectile weapons-the bow and arrow, the pistol and the gun.</p>

<p>Exploitative Industries.- Of the various exploitative or material acquiring
activities so necessary to the sustenance of the race, only one group--the art
of fishing--was illustrated. The four series shown were as follows:(1) the
dart, (2) the toggle, (3) the hook, (4) the sinker.</p>

<p>Domestic Arts--The domestic arts were represented by one series illustrating
the development of cooking arts and by three series showing the devices
employed in eating and drinking--the cup, the spoon, the knife and fork.To
these was appended the tobacco pipe.</p>

<p>Ceramic Art.--The great group of elaborative activities concerned in
manufacture was illustrated by three exhibits:the ceramic art, the textile
art and sculpture.Ceramics included four series- (1) implements and devices
employed in manufacture; (2) the vase; (3) glass; (4) enamel.Weaving has
three series (1) the spindle, (2) the shuttle, (3) the loom.Sculpture,
Stone-shaping.-Sculpture was represented by four series:(1) prehistoric stone
shaping (Europe), (2) aborignal American sculpture, (3) sculpture of civilized
nations, (4) implements employed in stone shaping.</p>

<p>The book-A small series was devoted to the history of the book, and the method
of assembling the several parts--the tablets or sheets of writing being the
feature considered.</p>

<p>Musical Instruments.--Four series were devoted to the development of as many
varieties of musical instruments:(1) wind instruments, (2) reed instruments,
(3) stringed instruments, (4) percussion instruments.</p>

<p>Photography.--Photography was represented by three interesting series showing
steps in the progress:(1) the camera, (2) the lens, (3) the picture.</p>

<p>Transportation, Marine.--The history of water transportation was epitomized in
four of its leading features; (1) the development of the hull, (2) methods of
land propulsion, (3) the wheel, (4) the screwpropellor.</p>

<p>Transportation, Land.--The subject of land transportation was partially shown
in three series (1) the burden bearer, and the sliding and the rolling lead,
(2) the wheeled vehicle, (2) the steam locomotive.</p>

<p>Electricity.--Electrical inventions, representing one of the youngest and most
marvelous branches of activity, were shown in three series:(1) experimental
apparatus, (2) transmitting apparatus, (93) recording apparatus.</p>

<p>Groups of Figures illustrating Practice of Primitive Arts: -Associated with the
development of exhibits were a number of life-sized figures modeled in plaster
and appropriately costumed, intended to illustrate the practice of the arts in
their primitive stages.They gave vivid impression of primitive processes as
contrasted with the methods and machinery of advanced civilization.The
subjects presented were as follows:</p>

<p>The Driller--An Eskimo man in reindeer-skin costume using a bow drill for
boring ivory.</p>

<p>The Flint Flaker--A Powhattan Indian roughing out stone implements.</p>

<p>The Hominy Huller-A Southern Indian woman pounding corn in a wooden mortar. 
Figure in plaster with costume restored form drawings made in Colonial times.</p>

<p>The Skin Dresser--A Sioux woman using a scraping or graining tool.</p>

<p>The Potter--Papago Indian woman modeling an earthen vessel, simple process.</p>

<p>The Metal Worker--A Navajo Indian making silver ornaments; process, probably,
in part at least, introduced by the whites.</p>

<p>The Belt Weaver--A Zuni girl with primitive loom weaving a belt.</p>

<p>Department of Biology.- The exhibit of this department of the Museum was
planned and prepared by Dr. F.W. True, Head Curator, assisted by Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger, Curator, Division of Reptiles and Batrachians; Mr. J.E. Benedict,
Assistant Curator, Division of Marine Invertebrates; Mr. Barton A. Bean,
Assistant Curator, Division of Fishes; Mr. W.H. Aahmead, Assistant Curator,
Division of Insects; Mr. C.W. Richmond, Assistant Curator, Division of Birds.</p> 

<p>Mr. Benedict supervised the installation of the whole exhibit of the
department.</p>

<p>The Department of Biology covers the entire field of zoology and botany.In
selecting a topic for illustration in the small space available, two ideas were
kept in view:first, to present a series of objects significant in itself, and
at the same time likely to be especial interest to visitors of the Exposition;
and, second, to have this series sufficiently diverse in character to show the
various methods employed in the department.</p>

<p>The exhibit comprised the characteristic animals of the salt and fresh waters
of North America, from the lowest to the highest forms, and the principal types
of seaweed.</p>

<p>Lower Invertebrates.- Three cases were devoted to the lower invertebrates, such
as crustaceans, worms, star fishes, and other echinoderms, jelly-fish, corals
and other coelenterates, and foramnifera and other protozoans.These were
arranged in zoological order, from the lower to the higher forms.The corals
and other low forms were in special cases near the side entrance.</p>

<p>Mollusks.- A floor case of the regular series was devoted to typical forms of
North American shells, chiefly marine.</p>

<p>Insects.- Aquatic and semi-aquatic insects occupied the adjoining wall.</p>

<p>Fishes.- A series of painted casts representing the principal families of North
American fishes occupied one-half of a long wall-case, about seventy families
in all were represented.Included with the casts were a small series of
skeletons of the lowest forms of fishes.</p>

<p>Reptiles and Batrachians.- The principal types of North American aquatic
reptiles and batrachians, such as the turtles, terrapin, water-snakes, frogs,
salamanders, etc., were exhibited in wall case.Casts of the larger
sea-turtles were exhibited on the wall directly above the case.These were the
leatherback turtle, the green turtle and the logger head.</p>

<p>Birds.- A large series included the principal aquatic birds of North America. 
They were arranged in zoological order as nearly as circumstances permitted in
the wall-case.</p>

<p>Mammals.- The following porpoises were represented by full-sized casts from
life.the harbor porpoise (Phocaene), the black-fish (Globicephala melas), the
grampus (Grampus griseus), and the dolphin (Delphinus delphis).</p>

<p>Seaweeds.- Aquatic plants were represented by seaweeds, a full series of the
principal American types of which were exhibited in two cases on the central
aisle.</p>

<p>Department of Biology.- The exhibit of this department was planned and arranged
by Dr. George P.Merrill, Head Curator, assisted by Mr. Charles Schuchert,
Assistant Curator, Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology; Mr. Wirt Tassin,
Assistant Curator, Division of Mineralogy; and Mr. F.A. Lucas, Acting Assistant
Curator, Section of Vertebrate Fossils.The exhibit was installed by Mr.
Schuchert and Mr. W.H. Newhall, Aid, Division of Physical and Chemical Geology.</p>

<p>The exhibit was planned and arranged to convey an idea to the public of the scope of the department.To this end the space was divided nearly equally
between the divisions of systematic geology, mineralogy, paleontology and
paleo-botany.</p>

<p>Division of Systematic and Applied Geology.- In this division were two cases
filled with examples of case deposits and concretionary structures, and five
cases containing minerals, rocks and ores of economic value, including a
characteristic series of the iron ores of the United States, and a systematic
series of the ores of minor metals, including those mercury, nickel, and
cobalt, antimony, bismuth and other rarer metals.Also a collection of
non-metallic minerals of economic importance including various salts used in
chemical manufacture, abrasive, fictile materials, asbestos, mica, mineral
pigments, graphite, coal and other natural hydrocarbon compounds.</p>

<p>Division of Mineralogy.- The exhibit of this division treated of the systematic
arrangement and chemical classifications of the several representatives of the
mineral kingdom.</p>

<p>The series was grouped under two classes - elements and compound of elements. 
The compounds of the elements were further divided in accordance with chemical
laws and grouped under certain prominent types according to, and which take
their names from their negative constituents, as follows:Compounds of the
halogena, fluorides, chlorides, bromides and iodides.Compoundsof sulfur,
selenium, and tellurium; also arsenic, antimony and bismuth including sulfides,
selenides, and tellurides; arsenides, antimonides; also sulphosalts, oxygen
compounds, including oxides and oxygen salts, borates, aluminates, chromited,
ferrites, magnites, selenites, and tellurites, carbonates and tantalites,
nitrates, vanadates, phosphates, arsenates, selenates, and tellurates,
chromates; molybates, tungstates, iodates, and urandates.Each of these groups
was proceeded by a descriptive label giving the name of the type and a brief
description of its more prominent character.Following the descriptive label,
arranged in order from left to right, were several representatives of the type
selected, so far as possible to illustrate the character of the group as a
whole.</p>

<p>Section of Invertebrate Fossils.- In one case was shown the largest American
ammonites, a group of chambered shells related to the living pearly nautilus. 
Another case was devoted to crinoids, a group of animals related to the
starfishes.The following two cases were occupied by trilobites, crustaceous
animals which became extinct shortly after the great coal series of the
Mississippi Valley had been formed.Still another case was devoted to
lamp-shells or brachiopods.The interior structure of some of these shells was
illustrated by models, showing among the characters, the spiral skeleton for
the support of the arms.</p>

<p>The crinoids, trilobites, and brachiopods were arranged according to their
structural rank into orders, families, etc., each of which was proceeded by a
descriptive label.All of these fossils were exhibited attached to buff
encaustic Floring tiles, a method of installation recently introduced in the
National Museum.</p>

<p>Section of Vertebrate Fossils.- In this section were shown series of specimens
of some of the earlier known forms of fishes, and series of teeth and spines of
carboniferous sharks.</p>

<p>These two series were accompanied by illustrations showing the forms of fishes
when restored and the position of the spines and their relation to the fins. 
Specimens of the fishes form the oecene formation of the Green River, and of
mosasar reptiles form the chalk formation of Western Kansas were also
exhibited.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment is made of the valuable assistance rendered the Representative
by Mr. W.V. Cox, Chief Clerk of the National Museum and Chief Special Agent for

<p>REPORT of the REPRESENTATIVE

of the

Commission of Fish and Fisheries.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Act of Congress, approved June 10, 1896, on June 27th
following W. de C. Ravenel, the assistant in Charge of the Division of Fish
Culture, was appointed Representative of the Commission of Fish and Fisheries
on the Board of Management of the United States Government exhibit, at the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, and, upon the organization of
the Board in September the Commission was allotted $20,000 and 5,027 square
feet of floor space in the Northwest corner of the Government building. 
Subsequently all allotments were changed owing to the passage on December 18th
of a joint resolution of Congress reducing the appropriation for the Government
exhibit form $150,000 to $137,000, so that the amount available for the
Commission was $18,333.In August, 1898, when the re-apportionment of the
funds was made the Commission was authorized to expend $2,500 additional,
making its total allotment $20,822.(#)In the re-assignment of space, the
Commission was granted 115 square feet additional.</p>

<p>As the live fish exhibit at previous expositions had proved the most attractive
feature, it was decided to devote the bulk of the money and 4,000 square feet
of the space to the erection of an aquarium for showing the important food and
game fishes of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries, besides the
important species proagated by the Commission and a series of marine fishes
from the New England coast.</p>

<p>The Aquarium:The plans and specifications for the aquarium were prepared by
Mr. Geo. A. Schneider, of the Commission, who also superintended its
construction.The aquarium was a grotto-like structure, 140 feet long by 26
feet wide, arranged thus:______________
with arranged entrances at the short arms______________
and rotundas at the turning points.The entrances were semi-circular arch-ways
supported on colonnades, embellished with ornamental work, soffit and face, and
flanked on each side by wings in a rich pilaster treatment of the renaissance
style.An ornamental semi-circular grill, with the seals of the United States
and the State of Nebraska, was inserted in the arch, the top of which
terminated in imitation shell-work, while over the key- stone was represented a
youthful posidon taming an aquatic monster.</p>

<p>Surmounting the entablature of the wings were two allegorical figures
representing fisher maids catching and planting fish in the waters of the
country.The exterior portions of the entrances were finished in imitation of
a roughly blasted tunnel, and depending from its roof were numerous stalactites
of a pale greenish hue.The aquaria, of which there were 25, were each 7 feet
long, 3 feet high and 5 feet wide at the top; they extended along the sides of
the interior of the grotto, and were decorated inside with rock and aquatic
plants, and so arranged that all light entering the grotto first passed through
them. Eight of the aquaria were used for showing such salt water fishes as
could be</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>(#) See statement of reapportionment and transfers of funds.</p>

<p>obtained off the New England coast near Woods Holl, Massachusetts, and the
balance were filled with a species indigenous to the Mississippi River and the
various fishes propagated by the Commission.In each of the rotundas were
large oval pools so arranged as to be illuminated from below with electric
lights.The salt water was circulated by means of two nickel pumps, located in
the basement of the building and driven by electricity.A large filter was
also provided for filtering fresh water, and an eight-ton Remington ice machine
and air pump.The details of construction of the aquaria and grotto including
water and air pipes, machinery, and supply and reservoir tanks are shown in the
accompanying plans.</p>

<p>In the rectangular space formed by the short arms of the grotto were exhibited,
as indicated on the accompanying plan, the material used for illustrating the
work of the three Divisions of the Commission.The methods employed in the
fish cultural work were practically demonstrated by the hatching in regulation
troughs of rainbow and black-spotted trout, and grayling eggs, which were
shipped by express from Colorado and Montana during the Months of June and
July.In August no work of this kind was attempted, though the methods were
illustrated by artificial eggs, but from September 18, to the close of the
Exposition the troughs were kept filled with quinnat salmon eggs shipped at
intervals from Baird Station, California.This feature of the exhibit was one
of the most interesting and instructive, and received close attention
throughout the period of the Exposition.As it was impracticable to secure
semi-buoyant eggs, like the shad, whitefish and pike perch, and floating eggs,
like the cod, pollock and flat-fish, the methods adopted in the hatching of
these were illustrated by means of artificial eggs made of rosin.In addition
to the practical illustrations models of the various forms of apparatus used
were exhibited, including a model of the trout station at Leadville, Colorado, 
The process of taking eggs was shown by a lay figure of a spawn-taker with
quinnat salmon in his hands, in the act of stripping the eggs.The work of
distribution was illustrated by photographs, drawings, and a working model of
the Commissioner's car No. 3, recently constructed by Harlan and Hollingsworth. 
In addition to this, three of the cars belonging to the Commission were on the
grounds from time to time with loads of fish, serving as a practical
illustration of this feature of the work.The results of fish culture and the
scope of the work accomplished by the Commission during the fiscal year 1896-97
were shown by large charts and numbers of photographs and drawings.</p>

<p>The scientific functions and work of the Commission were set forth by models
and photographs of the exploring vessels "Albatross" and "Fish Hawk", by an
assortment of seines, dredges and nets, and by the deep-sea sounding apparatus
used in making collections in fresh and salt water.In this section there was
also displayed a full collection of oyster shells, illustrating their sizes at
different ages, peculiarities common to various regions, materials used for the
attachment of spat, various objects to which young oysters, adhere, influence
of the bottom on the oyster's growth, and enemies and injuries caused by each. 
Among the objects of the American fisheries on exhibition were the following: 
Mounted groups of Northern fur-seals, Stellar's sea lions, casts of cetaceans,
140 casts of food-fishes (colored form living or fresh specimens)and painted
casts if edible frogs.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Messrs. Tiffany &amp; Company, of New York, a collection of
pearls, and pearl-bearing mollusks was shown, consisting of specimens of white,
pink and brown, copper-colored and fancy-colored pearls; a set of pearl bearing
shells and instruments for opening the same, a water telescope for finding the
mollusks, and illustrations of pearls.

<p>In the fisheries section, the various forms of nets, traps, weirs, pound nets,
seines, pots, dredges, tongs, etc., used in the capture of fresh-water products
were fully shown; together with characteristic types of fishing craft employed
in the American fisheries, among them the swift New England schooner, the
Florida smackee, the Chesapeake Bay Oyster pungy, the shad boat of the North
Carolina sounds, and the San Francisco market steamer.In addition to these
were numerous large photographs, portraying the methods adopted in the
important commercial fisheries of the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coats and the
Great Lakes, and a series of crayon pictures illustrating the Alaskan fur-seal
fishery.The fisheries of the United States were presented by states on a
large chart.</p>

<p>This model represents the most modern type of car in use by the Commission.It
was built by the Harlan and Hollingsworth Company, of Wilmington, Delaware, in
November, 1897.It is 67 feet 10 inches long, 9 feet 6 inches wide and 13 feet
10 inches high.The car is equipped with Pullman trucks and Allen paper
wheels, and provided with all modern appliances for travel found on passenger
trains.In one end of the car is an office which is furnished with sleeping
accommodations for two men; an ice box with a capacity of one and a half tons,
and a 500-gallon water tank.In the other end of the car are the kitchen and
machine rooms, containing a 5-horse power boiler and water and air pumps which
are required for the transportation of fish.The fish are transported in cans
and square tanks which are carried in two compartments extending along the side
of the car from the office to the machine room.These compartments are 30 feet
long, 3 feet wide, and 25 inches deep.A constant circulation of water and air
is maintained by the use of the pumps, the water being taken from a tank which
is carried beneath the car between the trucks, of a capacity of 600 gallons,
and pumped from this lower tank to the pressure tank above referred to, from
which it passes by gravity into the cans, then again back to the lower tank,
etc.In the center of the car, over the transportation compartments, are four
berths together with a number of lockers and closets for the use of the crew. </p>

<p>Model of Commission of Fish and Fisheries Hatchery at Leadville, Colorado</p>

<p>This station is located in Lake County, Colorado, six miles west of Leadville,
on a Government reservation of 1,935 acres.It was established in 1889, for
the purpose of propagating the black-spotted and other native varieties of
trout, and the introduction of species from Eastern waters.The hatchery is
built of red sandstone, and is equipped with a sufficient number of troughs to
hatch over 6,000,000 eggs.The water supply is obtained from Rock Creek and
from springs on the reservation.The temperature of the water throughout the
year varies from 37 to 46 degrees.During the past season over 5,000,000 brook
trout eggs were collected form the waters of Colorado and handled in this
hatchery as a result of this introduction of this species into the Colorado
waters.</p>

<p>LIVE FISH DISPLAY.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Exposition on June 1, the aquarium contained a large
variety of fresh and salt fishes, together with a number of aquatic
invertebrates.The fresh-water fishes comprised the brook trout, rainbow
trout, black-spotted, yellow fin trout, lake trout, steelhead trout,
large-mouth and small-mouth bass, crappie, strawberry bass, sunfishes, and the
characteristic native fishes of the Mississippi Valley, including the largest
obtainable specimens of sturgeon, catfish, and paddle-fish, several cat-fish
weighing forty pounds and over.These large specimens, with a number of
ornamental species like gold-fish, tench and golden ide, were displayed in oval
pools under the rotunda and proved a most attractive feature.Aquatic reptiles
were represented by living specimens of mud puppies, terrapin, edible frogs,
etc.In the salt-water tanks about 50 varieties of food, game and bait fishes,
of the Atlantic coast were represented by specimens of various ages, including
log-fish, skates, sea-bass, king-fish tautog, chogset, sculpin, scup, toadfish,
sea robin, pollock, cod, hake and flounders.Lobsters, crayfish, crabs and
various kinds of mollusks were also exhibited.</p>

<p>As anticipated, the water for the aquarium and hatching troughs which was
furnished by the Exposition Company and taken from the Missouri River proved
unsuitable for keeping alive the salmon and trout during the summer months, and
it became necessary to utilize the Remington Ice Machine early in June for
reducing the temperature of the water.It furnished an abundance of cool
water, not only for the tanks in which the salmon were kept, but also for the
hatching troughs.During the months of June, July, August and September, the
temperature of the water in the trout tanks did not exceed 60 degrees, though
it varied form 51 to 60 with an average of 55 degrees.In the tanks in which
the native fishes were kept, the temperature ranged during the month of June
from 63 to 86 degrees, reaching a maximum of 91 in August.All the water was
filtered before being used in the Aquarium or hatching troughs, but its
condition was very poor, many injurious parasites being abundant and fungus
developing very rapidly.During the latter part of June, the losses from
fungus were so heavy that it appeared as though it would be necessary to
abandon certain parts of the fresh water exhibit.Many remedies were tried,
including a weak solution of alcohol, but the results were not satisfactory. 
The only remedy that proved efficacious was the ordinary Turk Island salt which
was used in large quantities, as much as one and a half sacks being used daily. 
Where the disease had secured a strong foot-hold in the aquarium, the water was
drawn down until only about eight inches remained, when several gallons of salt
were thrown in, the water becoming so salt that the fish would turn over on
their backs, but they recovered as soon as fresh water was introduced, and were
in most cases cured.</p>

<p>Collections of Fishes;</p>

<p>The majority of the native fishes exhibited were collected from the Mississippi
River, under the direction of Dr. S.P. Bartlett, the superintendent of the
Quincy, Illinois, Station.Supplies were also received from Manchester, Iowa;
Neosho, Missouri, and from the Fish Commission Station at Lincoln.The
black-spotted, yellow fin, rainbow, lake steelhead, and loch leven trout were
furnished by the Commission Stations at Leadville, Northville, Manchester, and
Neosho.The marine species, embracing about fifty varieties of important food,
game fishes of the Atlantic Coast were collected under the direction of Mr.
E.F. Locke.At Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and transported in one of the
Commission cars to Omaha.</p>

<p>The salt-water exhibit did not prove as satisfactory as was anticipated or as
it had at previous expositions, many of the best specimens dying within a few
weeks after the opening of the Exposition.This was due not only to injuries
received in transit, but also the high temperature of the water, which varied
from 64 to 76 degrees in June.In order to successfully exhibit marine species
in cities like Omaha, where the temperature becomes very high in summer,
arrangements will have to be made so that the water can be kept at a
temperature of 65 to 68 degrees.The salt-water exhibit was finally abandoned
in August and fresh-water fishes substituted.

<p>Mr. R.J. Conway, assisted by Mr. W.P. Sauerhoof, to whose untiring energy and
attention much of the success attained was due, was in charge of the aquarium
and general management of the exhibit.

Valuable assistance was also rendered the Representative by Dr. H.M. Smith and
Mr. Sauerhoof in collecting and preparing articles for exhibition; also by Mr.
L.G. Harron, the superintendent of the aquarium in Washington, in the
installation of the aquarium and during the opening days of the Exposition;
also to Station Superintendents, Frank N. Clark, E.A. Tulian, H.D. Dean, E.F.
Locke, R.S. Johnson, S.P. Bartlett, and G.H. Lambson, for collections of fishes
for the aquarium.</p>

<p>The Commission again desires to tender its thanks to the Union Tank LIne
Company of New York, for the loan of two tank cars for transporting salt-water
from Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to Omaha, also the Michigan Central; the
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul;The Omaha, Kansas City and Eastern, and the
Union Pacific Railroad Companies, for free transportation of cars with
fresh-water fishes; and to the Michigan Central Railroad Company for the
transportation of Car No. 4. with salt-water fishes from Buffalo, New York to
Chicago; and to the Missouri Pacific Railroad COmpany for the movement of all
cars of the Commission to and from the Exposition grounds free.

We are also under obligations to the Nebraska State Fish Commission for fishes
furnished the aquarium and for assistance rendered in making collections from
various lakes and rivers in the state; to the Smithsonian Institution and
United States National Museum for the loan of various forms of apparatus and
other articles exhibited; to the Exposition COmpany for the water furnished for
the aquarium and electric power for the operation of the salt-water pumps and
ice machine.</p>

<p>THE INDIAN CONGRESS.</p>

<p>(By Mr. W.V. Cox, Secretary of the Government Exhibit Board.)</p>

<p>Among the many congratulatory remarks made in reference to the unqualified
success of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, an apt one, made
by Mr. James Mooney, the ethnologist, is that "such a showing in a town whose
citizens only thirty years ago were called upon to barricade their homes
against an attack of hostile Indians, well illustrates the rapid growth and
tremendous energy of the West, and the grit and determination of the exposition
managers."</p>

<p>What a change there has been in the sentiment and interest pertaining to the
Indian in the past thirty years!When these same western people, who then were
over fearful of "an attack of hostile Indians", came to plan a great display in
1898 of their achievements as pioneers and of the natural wealth of the
territory they had developed, they sought early to arrange as a prominent
feature of their exposition an assemblage of the "red skins" of all tribes, to
exhibit their past and present conditions, their customs and accomplishments,
in brief all that should indicate their degrees of savagery and civilization,
then and now.</p>

<p>The project was one in which the whole American people became interested, for
but recently the Indian hold sway throughout this region.There had also been
manifested for some years a growing public attention to the science of
anthropology, and it was hoped to make the exhibit of the Indians follow an
ethnologic plan, although later this had to be largely abandoned.</p>

<p>In December, 1897, at the instance of the management and friends of the
exposition, a bill was introduced in Congress providing an appropriation of
$100,000 to carry out the project as a part of the exposition.Although the
bill passed the Senate in an amended form, with some prospects for its passage
by the House of Representatives, before it could come up for final action, the
preparations for the war with Spain so monopolized legislative attention, with
the consequent scaling down of appropriations all along the line, that it was
found impossible to effect the passage of the measure as contemplated.Later
an item for the same purpose, carrying $40,000 was incorporated as a paragraph
in the Indian Appropriation Bill.Unfortunately, this bill did not become a
law until July 1, 1898, a full month after the opening of the exposition; and
the enacted legislation took the work out of the control of the exposition
management, while no time was left for adequate preparations.</p>

<p>Despite the limits of the appropriation and of the time to prepare for the
encampment, and notwithstanding the necessity of largely abandoning the making
of an ethnologic exhibit, the project resulted most satisfactorily,
particularly to the exposition management for nothing like it had ever before
been presented at any exposition, nor, in fact, had there ever been attempted
in this or probably in any other land so extensive an ethnologic exhibition. 
It was the strangest, most original, most interesting special feature of the
exposition.</p>

<p>Omaha being within easy reach of the large Indian reservations, it was possible
to bring together families aggregating 500 individuals, and representing 35
different tribes.The exhibit was designated as the Indian Congress, and it
occupied a plot of four or more acres within that portion of the exposition
grounds known as the North Tract.</p>

<p>It was realized by the Government authorities in charge of the exhibit that the
people at large held little interest in the educated Indian of the time.They
wanted to see him in his wild state, in his blanket and aboriginal tepee.They
were curious to witness the foot races, the fire dances, the native games of
the Indian of savagery, and cared little to see him if not wrapped in a blanket
of primitive weaving and decked out with paint and feathers.The authorities
endeavored to meet these ideas, but of course the Indian of the people's fancy
had passed away.</p>

<p>The Congress was visited daily by thousands of persons, who found it to be a
novel, entertaining--even a thrilling exhibition.To those of the visitors who
gave it more than passing attention, it presented an unusual opportunity for
studying the American Indian.The war dances, the ceremonials and the sham
battles given by the Indians attracted large audiences, completely absorbed at
the time with those unique and picturesque spectacles.</p>

<p>The Congress was ably managed by Captain W.A. Mercer, of the 8th U.S. Infantry,
under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs acting on behalf of
the Secretary of the Interior.</p>

<p>In his annual report for the year ending June 30, 1898, (pages 27-30), the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs says, in part: </p>

<p>"As showing the purpose and scope of the proposed congress of Indian tribes, I
quote the following from a letter of instructions sent to Indian agents in
regard to securing the attendance at the congress of representatives of various
tribes.</p>

<p>"It is the purpose of the promoters of the proposed encampment or congress to
make an extensive exhibit illustrative of the mode of life, native industries,
and ethnic traits of as many of the aboriginal American tribes as possible.To
that end it is proposed to bring together selected families or groups from all
the principal tribes and camp them in tepees, wigwams, hogans, etc., on the
exposition grounds, and their permit them to conduct their domestic affairs as
they do at home, and make and sell their wares for their own profit.</p>

<p>"It is represented that the Indian tribes are rapidly passing away or modifying
their original habits and industries by adopting those of civilization; that
there are yet many tribes within our borders whose quaint habits and mode of
life, which have remained practically unchanged since the days of Columbus, are
little known to the majority of our own people, and that an assemblage of this
kind proposed would not only be beneficial to the Indians participating, but
would be extremely interesting, as well as profitable, to the large body of
people in attendance.</p>

<p>"The first step will be to select the families or groups of Indians who are to
represent their respective tribes at the encampment.It is desired that the
encampment should be as thoroughly aboriginal in every respect as practicable,
and that the primitive traits and characteristics of the several tribes should
be distinctly set forth.This point should be constantly kept in view in the
selection of the Indians and in the collection of material.</p>

<p>"The Indians chosen to attend must be full bloods, and should be good types of
their respective tribes, consisting preferably of leading men or chiefs and
their families.The latter should be made up of man, wife, and one or two
(never more than three) minor children. While it is desired that family groups
and family life should be portrayed, it would be preferable that at least a
majority of the delegation consist of adults.</p>

<p>"Only Indians of good morals and habits should be selected, and most important
of all they must be strictly temperate.</p>

<p>"They should bring native dress if possible.They should also bring their
native domiciles or the materials with which to make them.They should also
bring the necessary articles with which to furnish and decorate their tepees or
other domiciles.As this will be a most interesting part of the exhibit the
furnishings should be as attractive and complete as possible.The necessary
materials for carrying on their native arts should also be brought, so that
they may engage in making articles for sale on the grounds. Where this can not
be done they may bring things illustrative of their craft in reasonable
quantities for sale.Necessary cooking utensils should be brought, and these
should be as primitive as possible.</p>

<p>"A collection of the implements and emblems of warfare would also be extremely
interesting, and where it can be arranged with any degree of completeness it is
suggested that such collection be brought.Articles to which a historical
interest attaches for any reason should also be brought if practicable.

"The Indians will not, of course, be at any expense for transportation to or
from the Exposition or for expenses for living while in attendance there, and
they will be well cared for."</p>

<p>"July 11, 1898, the Department (of the Interior) detailed Capt. W.A. Mercer,
U.S.A., acting agent of the Omaha and Winnebago Agency, Nebr., to install and
conduct the congress of Indian tribes at the Exposition, and on July 13, 1898,
granted Mr. J.R. Wise, a clerk in this office, leave of absence without pay and
appointed him as assistant manager to aid Captain Mercer at Omaha. . ."</p>

<p>Report of Capt. Mercer.</p>

<p>Captain Mercer's preliminary report, submitted to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs only six weeks after the Congress opened, is summarized in the
Commissioner's annual report, but the following is the full text of the same:</p>

<p>"The Indian Appropriation Act for the current fiscal year contains the
following provision:</p>

<p>"That the Secretary of the Interior be, and is hereby, authorized to cause to
be assembled at the city of Omaha, in the State of Nebraska, at such time and
for such period as he may designate, between the first days of June and
November, anno Domini eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, representatives of
different Indian tribes, as a part of the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition, to be held at the city of Omaha, in the States of Nebraska,
pursuant to an Act of Congress, entitled, "An Act to authorize and encourage
the holding of a Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition at the city of
Omaha, in the States of Nebraska, in the year eighteen hundred and
ninety-eight", approved June tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, for the
purpose of illustrating the past and present conditions of the various Indian
tribes of the United States, and the progress made by education, and such other
matters and things as will fully illustrate Indian advancement in civilization,
the details of which shall be in the discretion of the Secretary of the
Interior.And for the purpose of carrying into effect this provision the sum
of forty thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby
appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated; but
the Secretary of the Interior is hereby prohibited form making or causing to be
made, any expenditure or creating any liability on behalf of the United States
in excess of the sum hereby appropriated.</p>

<p>"In accordance with the foregoing provisions Capt. W.A. Mercer, U.S.A., Acting
Indian Agent of the Omaha and Winnebago Agency, Nebraska, was detailed to
install and conduct such Indian Congress.His detail was made by the Secretary
of the Interior on July 11th and it was about a week later that the active
installation of the Indian tribes was begun.The Exposition having opened on
the 1st day of June the work of installing the Indians was prosecuted with as
much expedition as possible and on August 4th, 1898, the Indian Congress was
formally opened, and although not nearly all of the Indian tribes which it was
originally intended to have present were on the grounds the Indians in
attendance and in the parade on that day numbered about four hundred and fifty. 
The 'Opening Day' was a complete success in every sense and everyone in
attendance was delighted with the showing and expressed words of praise for the
encampment.The attendance on 'Indian Opening Day' had only been exceeded once
during the progress of the Exposition and that was on July 4th.</p>

<p>"There were present for that occasion about one hundred and fifty Indians of
the Omaha tribe and about forty-five of the Winnebago tribe, all from the Omaha
and Winnebago Agency.These were not intended as permanent delegations for the
Congress and they returned to their reservations after remaining about ten
days.</p>

<p>"The Indians comprising the permanent delegations at that time numbered about
two hundred and twenty-five, representing about fifteen tribes and eighteen
reservations.The work of procuring and installing delegations from other
tribes was prosecuted without interruption and up to the present time,
(September 15th), the following tribes have sent delegations from reservations
and in numbers, including children, indicated in the table hereto annexed:</p>

<p>"Included in the band of Apache prisoners of war from Fort Sill are Chief
Geronimo, the famous Apache warrior and his able lieutenant Nachie; also a
large number of prominent men in the various delegations from the several
agencies.</p>

<p>"Many difficulties were encountered in the work of preparing and installing the
Indian Congress and in making it what it was originally intended by the
Department that it should be, namely, a Congress of the several Indian tribes
of the United States at which their native customs, habits, modes of dress,
domestic life, dwellings, etc., should be portrayed.The greatest difficulty
lay in the fact that Congress delayed the appropriation for the purpose so long
that insufficient time was allowed to properly select, equip and prepare the
several delegations. Again, many of the Indian Agents either lacked interest,
or else failed to appreciate the significance of the Congress in its broadest
sense.The Indians, too, in many cases were distrustful or hesitated, giving
the many excuses which only an Indian can conceive of for not wanting to come
to the Congress.This was especially true of some of the oldest and best types
of Indian tribes, the ones that were really most desired as delegates.As a
rule no difficulty was experienced in obtaining any number of half breeds or
partially civilized representatives, which for many reasons were the least
desired.</p>

<p>"It required renewed and repeated efforts and much persuasion to get Indians of
the class really desired.Some of the tribes failed to send delegations, owing
to the various reasons above outlined.</p>

<p>"Among such tribes might be mentioned the Utes, the Bannocks, the Shoshones,
the Nez Perces, the Osages, the Navajos and the Northern Cheyennes. After
having been at the Indian Congress camp a few days after having seen the
Exposition and its surroundings no difficulty would have been experienced in
getting delegations of any size desired including the best men, from the tribes
already represented.</p>

<p>"The delegations present are on the whole well equipped as to dress and camp
outfit and are most excellent types of their several tribes, and the Indian
camp affords an opportunity for the student of aboriginal Indian life never
heretofore presented.</p>

<p>"It was soon found from experience, however, after the Indian camp had been
installed, that this feature of it was of comparatively little interest to the
average visitor, who, having seen one or two camps had seen them all.In other
words, the real differences and characteristics of the Indians were of very
little interest to the average visitor.A scientific exhibit appeals to but a
small percentage of the Exposition visitors.The greater portion of the people
coming to the Exposition visit the Indian Congress, and invariably express the
fullest satisfaction.However, what they really desire is amusement; they
prefer to see the Indians in their full Indian dress on parade, conducting
their ceremonies, their dances, or participating in sham-battles.All of these
are being provided so far as practicable, to the delight of the eager crowds
which are often larger than the grounds can comfortably accommodate.</p>

<p>"The Indian Congress is not without interest to the Indians themselves and
those in attendance must necessarily be immensely benefited by their two or
three months sojourn at the Exposition, while the incidents and information
they will have to repeat to their people on their return to the reservation
will add further to the good accomplished by the Congress.</p>

<p>"Not one of the least interesting and beneficial results of the Indian Congress
is the opportunity it affords to the Indians of the several tribes to mingle
with, and make the acquaintance of, one another.This was one of the things
that was not fully appreciated prior to the installment of the Indian Congress,
but is really very significant.The Indians in attendance had probably never
seen and made the acquaintance, at most, of more than five or six other tribes,
and the privilege of making the acquaintance of people of their own race here,
representing twenty-eight or thirty different tribes, will certainly be an
event in the tribal history of all Indians represented.The sociability of the
Indians in the camp is a very marked feature and all the tribes mingle with and
visit among one another, with the greatest freedom and apparently the utmost
satisfaction.It is believed that this feature of the Congress alone is worth,
from the standpoint of the Indian, all that it cost the Government.It is an
Indian Congress indeed.</p>

<p>"In spite of the many difficulties and drawbacks encountered, the Congress of
Indian tribes is a success in its fullest sense.The visitors give expression
to remarks showing full satisfaction upon visiting the camp, while the
Exposition management is more than satisfied with the results."</p>

<p>In his letter transmitting the above report, Captain Mercer makes this
statement:</p>

<p>"In connection with said report, I think it proper to add in justice to myself
and to the Indians in attendance, that the weather has been trying in the
extreme nearly all of the time since the encampment was opened. Most of the
time we have had extreme heat accompanied by dry, hot winds, which rendered
camp life anything but pleasant, the conditions being rendered somewhat worse
by our location.

<p>"Following close upon the heated period we have just had a week of cold, heavy
rains which made the camp and life in it more disagreeable even than it was
during the hot spell.</p>

<p>"The weather has cleared now, the camp has taken on new life and inspiration,
and with favorable conditions I feel fully justified in predicting that the
Indian Congress will meet and even surpass the most sanguine expectations. 
Even with the unfavorable conditions which have existed we have had most
flattering notices from the Press, and everyone speaks in the most favorable
terms of the exhibition of the Indians and of the Indian life presented here on
the grounds at the expense of the Government."</p>

<p>Such ethnologic results as were obtained in the Congress were the work of Mr.
James Mooney, an expert of the Bureau of American Ethnology, a dependency of
the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, who was detailed at the special
request of the exposition management.In the American Anthropologist for
January--March, 1899, (vol. 1, no. 1, new series) Mr. Mooney has given an
interesting account of the Congress from the viewpoint of the ethnologist, from
which the following is taken:</p>

<p>Mr. James Mooney on the Congress.</p>

<p>"...The first Indians arrived in August, when the exposition was already half
over, and they continued to come in by delegations and singly until the close. 
Some went home after a short time, but the majority remained to the end.The
number contemplated in the estimates was 500, the actual number present varying
from about 400 to about 500.Filtered water for drinking was supplied to the
camp, and daily rations were issued nearly equivalent to the regular army
ration.There were three deaths--a Sauk warrior, who was buried in full Indian
dress, and two babies.Two infants were born during the encampment.</p>

<p>"Omitting several delegations which remained but a short while there were
represented about twenty tribes, viz:Apache, Arapaho (southern), Assiniboin,
Blackfoot, Cheyenne (southern), Crow, Flathead, Iowa, Kiowa, Omaha, Oto, Ponka,
Potawatomi, Pueblo (of Santa Clara), Sauk and Fox, Sioux, Tonkawa, Wichita, and
Winnebago.The Apache were in two delegations, the Chiricahua now held as
prisoners at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and the San Carlos delegation, coming
directly from Arizona.With the latter were several Mohave.The Flathead
delegation included also some Spokan and Kalispel.The Kiowa were properly
Kiowa Apache, practically a part of the Kiowa in everything but language. 
There were several delegations of Sioux, mainly from Rosebud and Pine Ridge
agencies in South Dakota.The Wichita delegation included one or two
individuals of the nearly extinct Kichai, while with the Tonkawa, themselves of
the verge of extinction, was a single woman of the broken tribe of the Lipan.</p>

<p>"...Four-fifths of the Indians thus brought together represented but a single
type, the ordinary tipi tribes of the plains.The wood carvers of the
Columbia, the shell workers and basket makers of Oregon and California, the
Navaho weavers, the Pawnee--aboriginal owners of Nebraska, --the tribes of the
gulf states, now living in Indian Territory, and the historic Ioquois of the
long-house were unrepresented.</p>

<span class="lg list"><span class="l">"Linguistically, the tribes are classified as follows:ALGONQUAN</span>
<span class="l">STOCK--Arapaho, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Potawatomi, Sauk and Fox; ATHAPASCAN</span>
<span class="l">STOCK--Chiricahua Apache, San Carlos Apache, Kiowa Apache, Lipan; CADDOAN</span>
<span class="l">STOCK--Wichita, Kichai; SALISHAN STOCK--Flathead, Spokan, Kalispel; SOQUAN</span>
<span class="l">STOCK--Assiniboin, Crow, Iowa, Omaha, Oto, Ponka, Sioux, Winnebago; TANOAN</span>
<span class="l">STOCK--Santa Clara Pueblo; TONKAWAN STOCK--Tonkawa; YUMAN STOCK--Mohave.</span></span>

<p>"We shall now speak in detail of some of the tribes, beginning with the one of
the most interesting.The Wichita, with their confederates, the Waco,
Tawakoni, and Kichai, numbering now altogether only about 320, belong to the
Caddoan stock, and reside on a reservation in southern Oklahoma.The first
three are practically one people and speak a dialect of the Pawnee language,
the Tawakoni particularly claiming close relationship with the Skidi division
of the Pawnee.The Kichai, reduced now to about 60 souls, are the remnant of a
tribe from eastern Texas, with a distinct language of their own.The Wichita
call themselves Kitikitish, meaning literally, 'raccoon eyelids', but
understood to signify 'tattooed eyelids', from a former custom among the men of
tattooing lines upon the eyelids.The women tattoo lines upon the chin, and
some of the older ones have their breasts covered with tattooed designs.From
this custom the Wichita derived their French name of Panis Piques.The common
name of the tribe has been variously explained, but may be connected with wits
or wets, their own word for 'man'.</p>

<p>"Within the historic period, which in their case dates back more than three
centuries, they have ranged from central Texas to Arkansas river, and there is
evidence that at one time a part of them at least lived farther eastward in
Arkansas and Louisiana.They are identical with the people of the ancient
Quivira, with whom Coronado, in 1541, found 'corn and houses of straw.At the
beginning of their official relations with the government the Waco and Tawakoni
were in Texas, about the present Waco city and Tawakoni creek, while the
Wichita and Kichai had their permanent village in the Wichita mountains, on the
upper Red river.Driven out of Texas by the whites, they were collected on the
present reservation in 1850, but had hardly gathered their firstcrop when they
were again scatted by the outbreak of the civil war, and fled north, remaining
about the site of the present city of Wichita, Kansas, until the struggle was
over, when they returned to their homes on the reservation.They have never
been at war with the whites.</p>

<p>"Like all the tribes of Caddoan stock, the Wichita are an agricultural people,
and even before the coming of the white man raised large quantities of corn,
which they ground into meal upon stone metates or in wooden mortars, or boiled
in pottery of their own making. Their surplus supplies were deposited in
cistern-like caches lined with bark.</p>

<p>"Their permanent houses are of unique construction, being dome-shape structures
of grass thatch laid over a framework of poles, with earth banked up around the
base.From Catlin we have a picture of such a village, as he found it, on
upper Red river in 1834, but, as is the case in the other of his drawings, with
the forms somewhat idealized.It may be mentioned that the circular
embankments on this village site were plainly to be seen when the writer
identified the location a few years ago.In making up the Wichita delegation
for Omaha a typical grass house was bought from the owner, on the reservation,
with the understanding that it should be taken down and the materials
transported in Indian wagons to the railroad, thirty miles away, thence to be
shipped to Omaha, to be again set up on the grounds of the Indian congress. 
The contract was faithfully carried out.The grass house was taken down,
transported by wagon and rail, and again set up in the original materials at
Omaha, the rebuilding requiring the labor of several women about one week.</p>

<p>"The inside support was a substantial square framework of stout logs, about
eight inches in diameter, planted upright in the ground, supporting
cross-pieces of the same size laid in crotches at the top.Over these
cross-pieces were bent long, flexible, half-round timbers having their bases
planted in the circular trench which formed the circumference of the structure,
while their tapering ends were brought together at the top and bound firmly
with elm bark to form rafters.Smaller flexible poles of perhaps an inch in
diameter were then bound across these at regular intervals from the ground to
the top.Over this framework the long grass was laid in shingle fashion in
regular rounds, beginning at the bottom, each round being held in place by
light rods fastened with elm bark to the supporting framework and cleverly
concealed under the next round of grass.Near the top, but at the side instead
of in the center was a smoke-hole.Doorways were left at opposite sides to
allow the breeze a free sweep, and detached doors were made of grass over a
framework of rods.Around the inside were high bed platforms, and in the
center was a fire-hole with a support from which to hang the pot.There was
also a grass-thatched arbor built in the same fashion, with a sweat-lodge of
willow rods.A curiously painted Indian drum, which they brought with them,
hung on the outside, the mortar and the metate near the doorway, and the
bunches of corn and dried pumpkin, with the Indian owners themselves, made the
Wichita camp altogether perhaps the most attractive feature of the congress.</p>
<p>
"At the close of the exposition the grass house, with the mortars and metates,
was purchased for the National Museum, and the materials transmitted to
Washington to be again set up in the National Park, where future visitors may
have opportunity to study the structure of the 'straw houses' of old Quivira.</p>

<p>"The Wichita delegation numbered thirty-eight, of whom fifteen lived in the
grass house, while the remainder occupied several canvas tipis adjoining.The
party had been carefully selected, and included several noted runners
distinguished in the ceremonial footraces of the tribe, two Kichai women, still
retaining their peculiar language, and one of them with the old-style tattooing
upon her face and body, and a mother with an infant in a cradle of willow rods. 
Physically the Wichita are dark and generally of medium size, with flowing hair
inclined to waviness.They were accompanied by their chief, known to the
whites as Tawakoni Jim, a man of commanding presence and fluent eloquence, and
in former years a scout in the service of the government.</p>

<p>"Another interesting southern tribe represented was that of the Kiowa Apache,
now numbering about 220, on a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma, adjoining
the Wichita.Although closely associated with the more numerous Kiowa, they
are of Athapascan stock, coming originally from the far north.They call
themselves Nadiishan-Dina, and are mentioned under their Pawnee name of Gataka
in a French document of 1682, being then in the same general region where they
became better known at a later period, participating with the Kiowa in all
their raiding wars until assigned their present reservation in 1869.Until
within a few years past they have been a typical plains tribe, without
agriculture, pottery, or basketry, depending entirely on the buffalo for
subsistence, and shifting their skin tipis from place to place as whim or
necessity guided.They hunted and fought on horseback, carrying the bow, the
lance, and the shield (and more recently the rifle), and joined with the Kiowa
in the great annual ceremony of the sun dance.Physically they are tall and
well made, with bold, alert expression.</p>

<p>"Every man and woman of the delegation came dressed in full buckskin,
beautifully fringed and beaded.They set up their canvas tipis adjoining the
Wichita, enclosing one of them with a circular windbreak of leafy willow
branches after the manner of the winter camps of the plains Indians. Suspended
from a tripod in front of the same tipi was a genuine, old-time 'buffalo
shield', the last shielding remaining in the tribe.It is now the property of
the National Museum.</p>

<p>"It may be in place here to describe the tipi, the ordinary dwelling of the
plains tribes.The name tipi, 'house', is from the Sioux language and has now
almost entirely superseded the former term, lodge.</p>

<p>"The tipi is a conical structure, formerly of dressed buffalo hides, but now of
cow-skins or canvas, sewn together with sinew, over a framework of poles of
cedar or other suitable wood, tied together near their tops and spread out at
the ground to form a circle of about twenty feet diameter.An average tipi
occupied by a family of about six persons has twenty poles in the circle and
stands about fifteen feet high to the crossingof the poles.Three--or with
some tribes four--particularly stout poles form the main support of the
structure.One of these is at one side of the doorway, which always faces the
east; another, to which is usually tied the 'medicine-bag' of the owner of the
dwelling, is nearly opposite the doorway, while the third is on the north side. 
These three poles are first tied together about two feet from their upper ends
with one end of a long rope, and are then raised in place by the women and
firmly planted in the earth.The other poles are next sorted out according to
length and leaned against them in such a way that when set up the tipi's
longest slope will be toward the front.The formula is:three main poles; two
sets of five longer poles each, one for each side and extending around to the
doorway; two sets of three shorter poles each, for the back; one pole which
fastened to the tipi covering at the back and serves to lift it upon the
framework.There are also two outside poles for the flaps.As each set of
poles is put in place another turn of the rope is taken around them at the
crossing, and when all are up the loose end of the rope is wound around one of
the main poles and firmly tied.The covering being lifted upon the framework,
the two ends are brought together in front and fastened with a row of wooden
pins running upward from the door, which may be a simple hanging flap, a coyote
skin, or something more elaborate.About twenty pegs fasten the edges down to
the ground, grass and wild sage being used to fill in any spaces which might
admit the cold air.The opening where the poles cross allows the smoke to
escape.On each side of the opening is a flap, held in place by two other
poles on the outside of the tipi, by means of which the draft is regulated as
the wind changes.</p>

<p>"The fire is built in a shallow hole dug in the center of the tipi.Behind and
on each side of the fire are low platforms, set close against the wall of the
tipi, which serve as seats by day and beds by night.The frames are of small
poles, supporting mats of willow rods, usually looped at one end in hammock
fashion, and covered with skins or blankets.Above the beds are canopies set
so as to catch the stray drops which come in through the smoke-hole during
rainstorms.The clear space of ground immediately about the fireplace, where
the women attend to their cooking operations, is sometimes separated from the
bed space by a border of interwoven twigs.The tipi is painted on the outside
with heraldic designs and decorated with buffalo tails, streamers from the
poles, or similar adornments.In summer it is set up on the open prairie to
escape the mosquitoes.In winter it is removed to the shelter of the timber
along the river bottom, and surrounded with a high fence or windbreak of willow
branches neatly interwoven.</p>

<p>"Such was the dwelling until recently in constant use by all the
buffalo-hunting tribes from the Saskatchewan to the Rio Grande, and for apart
of the year also by the semi-sedentary agricultural tribes, such as the Roe,
Pawnee, and Wichita.No other structure met so well the requirements of the
nomad hunters of the plains, as no other is so easily portable and so well
adapted by its shape to withstand the stormy winds of the timberless region. 
This is shown by the fact that it furnished the model for the Sibley tent.It
is still in use by all the plains tribes, with no change from the former
methods of construction excepting in the substitution of canvas for buffalo
hides and in the general inferiority of ornamentation and workmanship.</p>

<p>"Of the Kiowa Apache delegation the most prominent member was the hereditary
chief, White-man, now nearly seventy years of age, a kindly, dignified
gentleman, who has twice represented his people at Washington.In spite of
years he sits his horse as firmly and bears his lance as steadily as the
youngest of his warriors.In former days he was one of the two war leaders
deemed worthy to carry the beaver-skin staff which pledged them never to avoid
a danger or turn aside from the enemy.Another notable man is the captive,
Big-whip, whose proper name is Pablino Diez, and who jokingly claims kinship
with the distinguished president of the sister republic.He is one of a
considerable number of captives still living among these southern tribes, which
formerly made Mexico and the Texas frontier their foraging grounds.Unlike
most of these unfortunates, Pablino retains the knowledge of his name and his
Spanish language, and remembers vividly how he was taken, when about eight
years of age, in a sudden dash by the Apache upon the town of Parral in
Chihuahua.</p>

<p>"With some modification of detail the description of the Kiowa Apache will fit
the other plains tribes represented at the congress; the Dakota, Assiniboin,
Crows, and Blackfeet of the north; the Omaha, Ponka, and Oto of the central
region; and the Cheyenne and Arapaho of the south.With the exception of the
Omaha and Ponka, who are practically one people, they were all roving buffalo
hunters, fighting and hunting on horseback, dwelling in skin tipis, practicing
no agriculture, using the same weapons, and having similar military
organizations and tribal ceremonies.Most of them seem to have been
unacquainted with the clan system.The Omaha and Ponka had corn and
earth-covered lodges, both of which they probably obtained originally from
their allies, the Pawnee.All wore the prairie moccasin, breech-cloth, and
buckskin dress, differing only in length of fringe or color of decoration.The
men wore the scalp-lock, usually having the rest of the hair braided and
hanging down in front on each side of the head.With the Crows, and sometimes
the Blackfeet, it was pushed up or reached over the forehead.Excepting in the
substitution of cloth for buckskin, the majority of these Indians are but
little changed in appearance from the time when they were first put on
reservations. They are all of fine physical type, as might be expected in a
race of warrior and horsemen.The build is sinewy and the features thin and
clear-cut, excepting the semi-agricultural Omaha and Ponka, who show the effect
of a partial grain diet in rounder faces and portlier figures.The Blackfeet
and Crows are especially tall, with the Cheyenne and Arapaho not far behind. 
The Dakota are notable for their auiline noses and light complexion, the
Cheyenne also being much lighter in color than their neighbors.
"The Sioux, who call themselves Dakota or Lakota, 'allies', number about 25,000
souls, being the largest tribe or confederacy in the United States.They
formerly owned the greater portion of both Dakotas, with about one-half of
Minnesota, and are now gathered on reservations within their ancient territory. 
Although well known linguistically and in the pioneer history of the west, they
have yet to be studied form the ethnologic point of view.Their language was
reduced to writing some sixty years ago and has now a considerable literature. 
Nearly all the men of the tribe are able to conduct personal correspondence in
their own language.They have a special fondness for parade, and eagle-feather
war-bonnets are practically particularly numerous in this delegation.Among
those in attendance were several men of prominence, but no generally recognized
chiefs.Their tipis, some of which are tastefully decorated, were set up in a
circle, following the old custom of the plains tribes.The Watopana,
'paddlers', or Assiniboin, are an offshoot from the Yankton Dakota and speak
their dialect.Their range was north of that of the Dakota, extending across
the Canada boundary.They now number about 1400, gathered on two reservations
in Montana, besides a small number in Canada.They brought with them a fine
specimen of the old-style heraldic tipi.</p>

<p>"The Crows (Absaroko), numbering now about 2100 on a reservation in Montana,
occupied the Yellowstone country , west of their heralditary enemies, the
Dakota.Although predatory in habit, they have never been at war with the
whites, but on the contrary have usually furnished a contingent of scouts for
the government service in the various Indian campaigns of that region.They
have marked tribal characteristics, which would well repay study, as they are
practically unknown to the ethnologist.The most prominent man of the
delegation was White-swan, a former scout and the sole survivor of the Custer
massacre in 1876, in which notable engagement he was shot and hacked almost to
pieces and finally left for dead, but managed to save his life by covering
himself with the blanket of a dead Dakota.With his hearing destroyed by blows
of the tomahawk, his hands crippled by bullets, and his whole body covered with
enduring scars, he is still able to tell the story in fluent sign language.</p>

<p>"The Siksika, or Blackfeet, known to ethnologists through the researches of
Grinnell, are an important tribe numbering about 6000, in various sub-tribes
and bands, formerly ranging over the whole country from the Yellowstone to the
North Saskatchewan.Nineteen hundred of them are now gathered on a reservation
in Montana, the rest being in the adjacent Canadian province.Associated with
them are two smaller tribes, the Arapaho Grosventres and the Sarsi.In
physique the Blackfeet are among the finest men of the plains, tall and well
built, with erect pose and steady countenance.Those in attendance at the
congress belonged to the Piegan division, and brought with them an old-style
ornamented skin tipi.</p>

<p>"The Omaha, Ponka, and Oto, closely related Siouan tribes, numbering,
respectively, 1170, 820, and 350, originally had their settlements along
Missouri river in eastern Nebraska, under the protection of the powerful
Pawnee, who claimed the whole Platte region.Occupying thus a subordinate
position, they have never been prominent in tribal history, although in
ethnology they are among the best known tribes of the west, owing to the
extended researches of Dorsey, La Flesche, and Miss Fletcher.The Omahan, or
Omaha, have given their name to the exposition city.The word signifies 'up
stream', as distinguished from cognate tribes formerly living farther down the
river.They are also the originators of the picturesque Omaha dance, now
common to most of the plains tribes.They reside on a reservation about sixty
miles northward from Omaha and within the limits of their original country. 
Most of them now live in frames houses, but others still prefer their oldtime
earth-lodge.Some of the Ponka also are on a reservation in northeastern
Nebraska, but the majority with the Oto, have been removed to Oklahoma.</p>

<p>"The allied Cheyenne and Arapaho, who call themselves, respectively, Dzitsistas
and Inuna-ina, both names being about equivalent to 'our people', were
represented by a large delegation from Oklahoma.Typical buffalo hunters of
the plains, they yet have traditions of a time when they lived in the east and
planted corn.The Cheyenne number in all nearly 3500, of whom 2000 (southern)
are on a reservation --now thrown open to settlement--in western Oklahoma, the
remainder (northern) being on a reservation in Montana, excepting a few living
with the Dakota or Sioux.Their tribal 'medicine' is a bundle of sacred arrows
in the keeping of one of the southern bands.They are a proud, warlike people,
who have left a strong impress on the history of the plains.The Arapaho,
numbering in all about 1800, are also in two divisions, the larger body living
with the Cheyenne in Oklahoma, while the northern division resides with the
Shoshoni on a reservation in Wyoming.The Grosventres of Montana, formerly
associated with the Blackfeet and numbering now about 700, are a detached band
of Arapaho.Unlike their allies, the Arapaho are of accommodating temper,
disposed to pattern from our civilization, while the Cheyenne are strongly
conservative.Their 'medicine' is the 'flat pipe', in the keeping of the
northern division.As yet there has been no extended study of either of these
interesting tribes, although some good linguistic work has been done among the
Cheyenne by the Mennonitemissionary, Petter.The two tribes are devotedto
the ghost dance and are considered the most expert sign-talkers on the plains.</p>

<p>"From their reservation in western Montana came a delegation of Flatheads
(Selish), the historic tribe of De Smet and Ravalli, accompanied by several
Spokan (Sihqomen) and Coeur d' Alene (Kalispiel), the three tribes being
closely associated and cognate, speaking nearly similar Salishan dialects and
having the same dress and general appearance.Despite their name, the
Flatheads do not, and never did, have flat heads.This paradoxical statement
is explained by the fact that the Indians of the Columbia region, most of whom
formerly compressed the head by artificial means, considered their heads thus
treated as pointed, and contemptuously applied the term 'flat-heads' to their
neighbors in the mountains, who had not the custom, but allowed the skull to
retain its natural shape.The early travelers adopted the name without
understanding the reason of its application, and thus it came that the one
tribe which despised the practice was supposed to be above all others addicted
to it.</p>

<p>"The men wear their hair turned up from the forehead, somewhat after the manner
of the Crows.Their color is not the coppery brown of the eastern Indians, but
rather the creamy yellow sometimes seen among the Pueblos, which might be
described as Mongolian were not that term so liable to misconstruction.In
temper they are good-natured and fond of pleasantry, here again resembling the
Pueblos rather than the stern warriors of the plains.They formerly occupied
the tangle of rough mountains at the extreme head of Missouri river, subsisting
more by roots and berries than by hunting, as they were cut off from the
buffalo country by their powerful enemies, the Blackfeet.They had houses of
bark and reeds, as well as the skin tipi.In 1841 the heroic De Smet began
among them that work which continues to be the most successful in the history
of our Indian missions.In 1855 they were gathered on a reservation, where the
confederated tribes now number about 2000, besides about 670 Spokan and 500
Coaur d' Alene on the Colville reservation in Washington.</p>

<p>"The Hochunkara, or Winnebago, formerly having their territory in southern
Wisconsin about the lake that bears their name, were represented by a
considerable delegation under a sub-chief, Blackhawk.They speak an archaic
and strongly marked Siouan language, but had their alliances with the
Algonquian tribes rather than with their own kindred to the westward.In dress
and physical characteristics also they resemble the eastern Indians, wearing
the turban, the beaded garter, and the short breechcloth, and having the
compact heavy build of the agricultural tribes of the timber region.Living
remote from the buffalo country, they subsisted principally on corn, wild rice,
fish and small game.Their houses, still in common occupancy on their
reservation, are of the wigwam type, of woven rush mats upon a framework of
poles, much resembling the wigwam of their former neighbors, the Sauk. 
Friendly, but conservative, they have a rare mass of ethnologic lore which yet
remains to be studied.They number now about 1150 on a reservation adjoining
the Omaha in northeastern Nebraska.</p>

<p>"The historic Sauk and Fox were well represented by a large delegation from
Oklahoma and a smaller party from the band now living in Iowa.These two
tribes, calling themselves respectively , Sagiwuk and Muskwakiuk, names of
somewhat doubtful interpretation, are practically one people, speaking closely
related dialects of one language and having been confederated from a very early
period.They were prominent in every Indian movement of the lake and upper
Mississippi region from the beginning of the French and Indian war until their
power was broken by the result of the Black-hawk war in 1832.Their territory
lay on both sides of the Mississippi, in Iowa and northern Illinois, having the
cognate Potawatomi and Kickapoo on the east, the Winnebago and Dakota on the
north, and the Iowa on the west.With all of these, excepting the Dakota, they
maintained a friendly chief of the Black-hawk war, and Anamosa in the same
state commemorates an heroic mother of the tribe who swam the Mississippi with
her infant tied upon her back to escape a massacre in which nearly two hundred
men and women, and children of the Sauk fell by the bullets of 1600 American
troops.The younger daughter of Anamosa accompanied the delegation.</p>

<p>"The Sauk have always been agricultural, and they wear the turban and
characteristic moccasin of the eastern tribes.Their beaded work is especially
beautiful, and like the Winnebago they weave fine mats of rushes with which
they cover the framework and carpet the floors of their long, round-top
wigwams.They brought with them sufficient of these mats to set up several
wigwams, which are entirely different in shape and structure from the conical
tipi of the plains tribes.In person they are tall and strongly built, with
faces indicating they hold fast their forms, legends, and complex social
organization, and are today probably the most interesting study tribes of the
whole existing Algonquian stock.They have a syllabic alphabet, apparently the
work of some early French missionary, by means of which they keep up a
correspondence with friends on their various scattered reservations.The same
vehicle could doubtless be used in recording their songs and rituals.The two
tribes now number together about 970, of whom 500 are in Oklahoma, nearly 400
in Iowa, and a small band in Kansas.Some work has recently been done by Prof.
W.J. McGee in the Iowa band, which is composed chiefly of Muskwaki, or Foxes.</p>

<p>"With the Sauk there came also several of the cognate Potawatomi (Potowatmik),
and four Iowa (Pahoche), the latter being a small Siouan tribe, now reduced to
260, formerly living, in alliance with the Sauk, in central Iowa, which derives
its name from them.</p>

<p>"The Pueblos were represented by a delegation of about twenty men from Santa
Clara pueblo on the upper Rio Grande in New Mexico.As is well known, the
Pueblos substitute one of our most distinct and interesting native types, but
owing to the fact that the agent who made up the delegation was instructed to
send only men, it was impossible to make any showing of such characteristic
industries as bread making, pottery making, or basket weaving.As Santa Clara
is one of the smallest of the pueblos, and only a short distance from the
railroad and the town of Espanola, its inhabitants have been so modified by
contact with white civilization that they have almost forgotten their
aboriginal arts and ceremonies.Being unable to carry on any of their native
industries or to participate in the ceremonials of the other tribes, the Santa
Clara men confined their effort chiefly to disposing of some cheap pottery of
the sort made for sale to tourists at railway stations.</p>

<p>"The 26 existing Pueblo towns of New Mexico and Arizona, with some transplanted
settlements near El Paso, Texas, have altogether a population of about 11,000
souls, representing, according to our present knowledge, four different
linguistic stocks.Three pueblos have more than one thousand souls each, while
Santa Clara has but 225.The type is too well known, from the researches of
trained investigators, to need any extended notice here.The Santa Clara
Indians belong to the Tanoan stock.They call themselves Owino, and their
village Ka'pa, a name which seems to contain the root pa, water.They are
aware of their relationship to the people of the Tuaayan village of Hano, which
some of their old men have visited.Nearly all have Spanish names in addition
to their proper Indian names.They elect a governor, or chief, every year. 
Their present governor, Diego Naranjo, with the last ex-governor, old Jose de
Jesus Naranjo, accompanied the party, the former bearing as his staff of office
an inscribed silver-headed cane presented to the pueblo by President Lincoln in
1863.</p>

<p>"A small but notable delegation was that of the Tonkawa, who call themselves
Tichkan-watich, 'indigenous people', a title arrogated by half the
insignificant little tribes known to ethnology.Although the mere remnant of a
people on the verge of extinction, the Tonkawa are of peculiar interest from
the fact that, so far as present knowledge goes, they constitute a distinct
linguistic stock, and are the only existing cannibal tribe of the United
States, while historically they are the sole representatives of the Indians of
the old Alamo mission, whose most tragic incident had its parallel in the
massacre that practically wiped out their tribe.</p>

<p>"Living originally in southern Texas, the Tonkawa experienced all the
vicissitudes that come to a vagrant and outcast people until they were finally
gathered, in 1859, on what is now the Kiowa reservation, having their village
on the south bank of the Washita, just above the present Anadarko.The other
tribes, which hated them for their cannibal habit and for the assistance which
they had given the troops in various border campaigns, took advantage of the
confusion resulting from the outbreak of the rebellion to settle old scores,
and joining forces against the Tonkawa, surprised their camp by a night attack
on October 23, 1862, and massacred nearly half the tribe.Since then their
decline has been rapid, until there are now but 53 left alive, on lands
allotted to them in eastern Oklahoma.Some excellent studies have been made
among them by Gatschet, who determined their linguistic isolation.Their
chief, Sentele, alias Grant Richards, a former government scout, accompanied
the party.</p>

<p>"The celebrated tribe of Apache, who call themselves Nde, 'men', was
represented by two delegations, numbering together about forty persons, viz: 
some White Mountain Apache from San Carlos reservation in Arizona, and some
Chiricahua from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where they are now held under military
restraint. With the former there were also some Mohave, a distinct tribe of
Yuman stock.</p>

<p>"From their connection with the border wars of the southwest and through the
researches of the late Captain Bourke, the Apache are so well known as to
require no extended notice here.A part of the great Athapascan stock, they
have fought their way through hostile tribes from Yukon river to the Rio
Grande, finally establishing themselves in the mountain region of southern
Arizona and New Mexico, whence they made unceasing forays in all directions
until their name became the synonym of all that was savage and untamable.Form
the nature of the country in which they lived, and their inherited capacity for
enduring hardship, they proved the most dangerous foes against whom our troops
were ever forced to contend.Since their final subjugation , and since a
native intelligence and solidity of character that bid fair to place them in
the front rank of self-supporting tribes.It will be remembered that they are
first cousins of the Navaho, the most successful stock raisers and most expert
weavers in the United States.They number nearly 5000, all now on San Carlos
reservation in Arizona, excepting the Chiricahua band of about 300, held as
prisoners of war at Fort Sill.They have no central organization, but are
subdivided into a number of bands, each under its own chief.</p>

<p>"The White Mountain delegation was under command of the hereditary chief,
Go-zhazh, 'Jingling', known to the whites as Josh, of pleasing features and
manly air.They wore the dress of their tribe, with flowing hair, red turban,
close-fitting buckskin legging, and characteristic turned-up moccasin.The
women have their hair cut across the forehead.Nearly all the men had tattooed
upon their foreheads resembling the rain and cloud symbol of the Hopi.The
Mohave had the same dress and general appearance.They brought with them their
native baskets and dance costumes and set up their round-top canvas wikiups
after the style of those on the reservation.</p>

<p>"The Chiricahua, the last Apache band to go on the warpath, were finally run
down and compelled to surrender to General Miles in 1886.As the people of
Arizona protested against allowing them to remain longer in that territory,
they were deported bodily to Fort Marion, Florida, thence after some time to
Mount Vernon barracks in Alabama, and at last to Fort Sill, on the Kiowa
reservation, Oklahoma, where under a few years of good management they have
developed from miserable savage refugees to prosperous farmers and stock
raisers, quite a number being enrolled and uniformed as United States Scouts. 
The delegation was a picked one, and included Naichi, 'Meddler', the hereditary
chief of the band, a man of soldierly air and figure; Geronimo, the old war
captain, a natural leader of warriors, but withal a most mercenary character,
with one or two foot-racers and experts in native arts, and several women, with
two infants in cradles.Being under military control, they were housed in army
tents.The exiles devoted their time to good advantage, making baskets, canes,
and beaded work for sale, and found much pleasure in meeting their old friends
from Arizona and exchanging reminiscences.</p>

<p>"Some tribal ceremonies were arranged, but were discontinued...Among those
given were the noted ghost dance of the plains tribes, the mounted horn dance
of the Wichita, and the unique and interesting war dance and devil dance of the
Apache, the last being performed at night by the light of a fire, with a clown
and other masked characters, after the manner of the Hopi or Moki dances. 
There were also foot-races by picked runners from several tribes.</p>

<p>"The Kiowa camp circle--a series of miniature heraldic tipis in buckskin, with
the central medicine lodge and all the necessary shields, tripods, and other
equipments to make it complete--was brought from Washington and set up within a
canvas corral of eighty feet diameter.This presentation of the old camp
circle of the plains tribes is a complete reproduction, on a small scale, of
the last great sun-dance camp of the Kiowa Indians, just previous to their
signing of the historic treaty of Medicine Lodge in 1867, by which they gave up
their free life and agreed to be assigned to a reservation.It is the property
of the National Museum, and was prepared on the reservation under direction of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, every miniature tipi and shield having been
made by the hereditary Indian owner of the original.</p>

<p>"Under an arrangement between the exposition management and the Bureau of
American Ethnology a special fund was appropriated for securing portraits of
the Indian delegates.The work was done by the exposition photographer, under
the supervision of a member of the Bureau, according to a systematic plan, the
Indians being photographed in costume in tribal groups and singly, in bust,
profile, and full length, resulting in a series of several hundred pictures
forming altogether one of the finest collections of Indian portraits in
existence.The negatives are now in possession of the Bureau.At the same
time the Indian name of each individual was obtained, with its interpretation,
and some points of information concerning the tribe, with brief vocabularies of
each language.</p>

<p>REVIEW.</p>

<p>The plan for the holding of an Exposition at Omaha is one that was not the
product of an inspiration, nor was it a suddenly conceived and hurriedly
launched scheme.For some years people of the west had talked of the value of
such an enterprise, the practical and lasting benefits to be secured, etc., but
in most cases it was not more than talk.</p>

<p>The seed of the matter was, however, sown in the success of the World's
Columbian Exposition at Chicago, and it was destined to grow and bloom forth at
some time and at some place in the west.The men who had helped to build up
the great west were not of the timber to forever neglect to utilize such an
opportunity.The great financial panic which swept over the whole country in
1893, paralyzing all industries and avocations and spreading disaster and want
all over our fair land, halting all progress, staying all plans for continued
development of the resources of, particularly, the region west of the Missouri
and Mississippi Rivers; followed, as it was by the disastrous crop failures,
caused by drouth, in the years 1894 and 1895, caused people to bend every
effort toward self support and to endeavor to preserve all that was possible to
save from the wreckage caused by the financial panic and crop failures and
thought and effort toward advancement and development were for that time quiet
and still if not dead.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1894, the matter of the location of the Nebraska State Fair
for the ensuing five years was being considered, and the Commercial Club of
Omaha realizing that something must be done to arouse Omaha's people from the
lethargy that held them, proposed that an effort be made to secure the location
of said fair at Omaha.The effort was made, it was successful and the State
Fair was duly located at Omaha, this was under the agreement upon the part of
Omaha to provide suitable grounds, buildings, etc., etc., for such purpose.To
carry out this agreement the Omaha Fair &amp; Speed Association was organized and
incorporated and the work of fulfilling the agreement was proceeded with.</p>

<p>It was found that to fully comply with all requirements the sum of $_________
must be raised.It was said by the many to be impossible, that it could not be
done, that our people already distressed by hard times,could not possibly
provide such a sum for the purpose, nor was it right that they should be called
upon or asked to do so.Omaha's credit was, however, at stake under its
contract, and the effort had to be made, it was successful and all requirements
of the contract were fully met, except as to transportation facilities, which
failed lamentably, but which was the fault only of the street railway company.</p>

<p>The success coming to the efforts in this case was convincing evidence that
Omaha could do anything it fully resolved to do, and was the direct cause of
the confidence that Omaha could take up the Exposition scheme and carry it to a
successful termination.It was also the primary cause and basis of the
determination to proceed with the exposition scheme and exploit it fully.</p>

<p>Much of the preliminary work was supported by those prominently active in the
other work referred to, and the first Board of Directors of the Exposition was
mostly the same men who comprised the Board of Directors of the Omaha Fair and
Speed Association and to whom much of the credit of the final success is due,
by reason of their careful and judicious planning and early active work.</p>

<p>The proposition to hold a great Exposition at Omaha, conditioned upon U.S.
Government recognition and participation, yet involving upon Omaha the
necessity of raising, at least $300,000.00 and probably $500,000.00 was
regarded by many of our very conservative citizens as, at least, ill-timed, if
not fanciful and foolish.As every city has it croakers, so it was in Omaha,
and there were those who freely predicted that the effort to secure
subscriptions amounting to $300,000 was sure to fail.When finally not only
this sum, but a greater one was subscribed, then it was said, it is one thing
to subscribe and another to collect, in these times and under existing
conditions, the subscribers cannot pay.Well the Ways &amp; Means Department
report in this relation, shows that they did pay, but the report does not show,
as it might, the refulgent credit due the subscribers who paid.Only those who
by bitter self denial and prideful self sacrifice kept their pledges and paid
their subscriptions can know what it cost them to do it and how difficult the
task was.The collection of the subscriptions was made mainly in 1896 and
1897, and the Trans-Mississippi Territory never should again experience the
closeness in financial matters that prevailed during the years of 1893 to 1898. 
All honor to those who so patriotically pledged themselves to the support of
the Exposition and who so heroically stood by their pledges and through self
denial and self sacrifice liquidated their pledges to the full.</p>

<p>It has lately been said, retrospectively, that the people of Omaha, being at
the time in desperate straits, took hold of and supported the Exposition in the
belief that desperate situations justified desperate chances, and so believing
took chances on the exposition proving the vehicle, so to speak to "Pull them
out of the hole".There is much truth in this view of the situation.</p>

<p>Like other similar projects, as the work of exploitation and development
proceeded the plan and scope broadened and as doubting states and interests
discovered that the enterprise was not a mere advertising scheme, but was
surely to be, as planned, a Trans-Mississippi Exposition, recognized approved
and participated in by the U.S. Government, they desired to be represented
therein, and their wants and needs with the impulse thereby given, caused
further broadening which in time required more financial support, and while the
"load " of success or failure was primarily with the Board of Directors, yet it
was mainly and always resting heavily on the Executive Committee, whose
members, with the President, gave daily their best thoughts and attention to
the affairs pressing upon them.The matters of finance caused most concern,
and it was very difficult to float the enterprise, when the rocks in the stream
of cash were so constantly in evidence, constant shifting of the helm was
needful, and one time in the winter of 1897, when one of the principal
contractors knocked on the door of the room in which the Executive Committee
sat and sent in word that unless his estimate for $12,000.00 already delayed
several days, was paid within 30 minutes, he would call off his men and publish
his reasons therefor, it was realized that the craft had bumped a some
considerable rock, the situation was canvassed, the cash in the treasury was
much less than $1,000 and coming in slowly, a crisis was at hand,- but happily
it was averted by the chairman of the Executive Committee, and the President,
who advanced the money and held the voucher for some time until the treasury
was so replenished that the payment could be made.This will serve as an
illustration of the many complex and critical situations confronted and of
which the Board of Directors and the stockholders could not be advised, because
to do so would cause publicity, and publicity in such cause would work great
harm and detriment.</p>

<p>In November and December 1897, and in January 1898, the outlook for the
exposition was very favorable.The Exhibits Department was in a quandary as to
how to care for the increasing exhibits per applications for space, and the
management were seriously considering a way to provide more space by annexes to
the various buildings.</p>

<p>The promotion Department with the President had planned, to have large and
numerous encampments of soldiers and military on the grounds, and it was
believed that much benefit and patronage would result by reason of this
attraction, but in February came the breaking out of hostilities with Spain,
and the thought attention and energies of the people was occupied by this great
issue and consequently, lesser issues must suffer.The encampment of soldiers
were not longer to be hoped or planned for.Cancellation of applications for
exhibit spaces came in plentifully by every mail.The newspapers of the
country gave all space to the news of and about the war to the almost entire
exclusion of notice of our proposed exposition.The outlook for our success
became less favorable, the clouds hung heavy and low over our prospects; some
of the Directors advised postponement to 1899; others counseled abandoning the
project, and but few indeed favored proceeding and making best and most of the
situation.The President, Executive Committee and a few braves of the
Directory considered carefully the situation.To abandon meant disaster, dire
and humiliating; to postpone meant failure for the reason that the extra
financial burden incident to postponement would sink the ship before ;the
harbor of the postponed date was reached, and thus it was concluded that the
only thing to do was to proceed, carefully, wisely yet bravely and confidently,
strong in grit and determination to win success in spite of all adverse
circumstances.Each and all took new resolution and devoted their energies
more closely; economy was practiced in all departments, and the success, of all
kinds, that eventually came to the enterprise, is no doubt attributable in no
small degree to the adversities and discouragements of the period prior to
opening days.</p>

<p>The general story of the Expositionis well told in the preceding report of
proceedings and reports of departments officers and superintendents.Yet there
are some sidelights and actions not there related, that belong to a historical
relation, and of value to any future exposition.</p>

<p>While in the main the exposition affairs were most admirably managed and
generally the right thing was done, yet there were mistakes made, a few of
which caused discredit and loss to the Exposition and its treasury.In the
Ways &amp; Means Department, owing to the feeling of economy that possessed the
management, the office force was so small as to cause a behind-handedness in
some of the work, which later afforded the expert accountant employed to
investigate all the departments of the exposition, basis for criticism to some
extent, on the simplicity of the accounting and recording methods, they not
being of the approved and many times recorded and checked methods, so favored
by lovers of systems requiring great routine, many books of record and a large
clerical force to keep the work up to the hour.The system used was simple and
direct, yet efficient, and fully satisfactory to those having direct control of
events, and not a penny of money was received that was not fully and
satisfactorily accounted for.Weekly and often daily, statements of receipts
from all sources, and of disbursements both by departments and by requisition
were rendered to the Executive Committee and President, and monthly to the
directors.In the Department of Publicity &amp; Promotion a mistake was made at
the time of organization by selection of a newspaper publisher as the chief of
that department.The enmities and jealousies of the publishers of the two
principal newspapers of the city resulted in such criticism and such strenuous
defense as to detract from that unanimity of purpose and concentration of
energy so vital to securing success. The publication of criticism and defense
regarding plans of issue of complimentary admission to the Press were the cause
of much injured feelings and impaired results in the publicity of the
Exposition and its features.The attacks of the Omaha Bee on the honesty and
integrity of the management and principal employees of the Exposition were not
only unjust and uncalled for, but caused suspicion, distrust and diminution of
energy and zeal to the great loss of the Exposition.An investigation
committee was under these charges, appointed, and their report at meeting of
directors, June 30, 1902, shows the lack of basis for the charges made and
published.</p>

<p>The attack made by the same paper in October, upon the Bureau of Awards,
charging collusion, gross dishonesty and crime upon those prominently connected
with the work of the Awards Bureau, as likewise unfounded and later
investigation, full and complete, fully justified this conclusion.These
charges were telegraphed broadcast over the United States, finding publicity in
the great newspapers of the country, and cast discredit and contumely upon the
work of the Awards Bureau and further resulted in loss of thousands of dollars
to the Exposition treasury, through loss of sale of duplicate awards, diplomas
and awards medals.The newspapers of an Exposition city wield a potent power
over the good will of an Exposition and it would be well if, in a city holding
an Exposition, the example of the many newspapers of Buffalo, N.Y. in relation
to the Pan-American, be followed .Whatever their differences were in regard
to plan, policy or procedure, and there were many such, they did all such
business sub rosa, and to the reading public and the outside world they
presented a harmonious front, heartily supporting, commending and applauding
the work of the Exposition management.A like support from the newspapers of
Omaha would have resulted in much gain, particularly in finance to the
Exposition.</p>

<p>The Publicity Department of an Exposition should be in charge of a good
business man, who is not a publisher of a newspaper.The Press generally will
then aid in the work more heartily and more earnestly.</p>

<p>The Buildings &amp; Grounds, Exhibits, Concessions and Transportation Departments
have their stories well set out in the reports on said departments.</p>

<p>That part of the President's duties which can well be told, is given in report
on special days and features, in which he was ably assisted by the General
Manager, Mr. T.S. Clarkson.</p>

<p>Criticism has sometimes been made upon the form of organization of the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition, and the judgment given that better results could
have been secured under a different organization, with a Director-General as
the official heal of the operating departments.When considering this subject,
it must be taken into account that a Director-General is looked to for all
things, and that the days are generally too short for him to give proper
attention to all the things that come before him.Under our organization, each
member of the Executive Committee was, ineffect, the Director General of the
affairs of his special department, advising in weighty affairs, with the full
committee and the President, constituting the full advisory Board of the
Exposition.Thus the best advice and counsel was secured and the execution of
all affairs was in charge of excellent business men, hence, when all argument
is exhausted, it will be conceded, that, granting the selection of able,
successful, reputable and responsible men of affairs as members of the
Executive Committee, and the selection of an able, discreet, politic man of
affairs as President, there cannot well be a better organization than was this,
to promote a venture and guide and control it to a final honorable success.</p>

<p>Early in 1897 the Executive Committee, with the President, prepared an estimate
of probably receipts from all sources, and probable requirements for
disbursement of funds for all the necessities of the exposition.In preparing
this estimate the President and Executive Committee gave very careful
consideration to the subject and it is with satisfaction and pleasure they now
view this estimate in comparison with ascertained and certain results.It is
probable that but few, if any, estimates have been made by any management of
enterprises of such problematic character and temporary establishment as this
Exposition, that so favorably compared with ascertained results.This estimate
was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Subscriptions and Donations,................$600,000.00</span>
<span class="l">Less Discount and Loss,..................... 100,000.00</span>

<span class="l">Available for Buildings &amp; Grounds,...........$950,000.00</span>

<span class="l">Estimate for cost of Buildings..............$550,000.00</span>
<span class="l">Estimate for Grounds including
power, light, etc.,....................$250,000.00</span>
<span class="l">$800,000.00</span>
<span class="l">Margin of safety,............................$100,000.00</span>

<span class="l">Estimate of operating expenses during period of
Exposition, 150 days at $2,000 per day,...........$300,000.00</span>
<span class="l">Estimate of receipts from the Departments of 
Exhibits and Concessions &amp; Privileges,............$400,000.00</span>
<span class="l">Margin of Safety,............................$100,000.00</span></span>

<p>The ascertained results are as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Received from subscription,............................$553,415.20</span>
<span class="l">Received from paid admissions,.........................$801.515.47</span>
<span class="l">Expenses up to opening day other than 
Building and Grounds,.............................$218,308.00</span>
<span class="l">Cost of Buildings and Grounds Buildings,... $592,867.00</span>
<span class="l">Grounds, Including Power &amp; light,.......... $272,000.00</span>
<span class="l">$864,867.00</span></span>

<p>Cost of operation June 1st to Nov. 1st</p>

<span class="lg list"><span class="l">Daily average in round figures,...................$2,000.00</span>
<span class="l">Receipts from Exhibits &amp; Concessions

<span class="l">Concessions &amp; Priv.,....293,946.47</span>
<span class="l">$494,056.95</span></span>

<p>Comparison of estimate of expenses for stated purposes against the certain
results shows that the estimates were based upon good and safe judgments:and
that the management held strong control over affairs, thus holding the expenses
generally within the estimated amounts and increasing the receipts in all cases
over the estimates.The net money results are greater than the estimates in
the sum of $215,812.62</p>

<p>For the operation of the Exposition a large number of employees were required. 
The October pay-roll, which fairly represents the requirements, shows as
follows by divisions:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">President,.................................. 4</span>
<span class="l">Ways &amp; Means-
Secretary's Office,...................... 15</span>
<span class="l">Bureau of Music,.........................2</span>

<span class="l">Other Employees,.........................231--444</span>
<span class="l">Exhibits,...................................19</span>
<span class="l">Concessions &amp; Privileges,...................91</span>
<span class="l">Transportation,............................. 2</span>
<span class="l">Total,............................745</span></span>

<p>Distribution of assets were ordered to paid-up stockholders as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">November 4th, 1898 (4 days after close of Exposition),................... 75 per cent.</span>
<span class="l">April 1st, 1899,....................... 12-1/2 per cent.</span>
<span class="l">June 26th, 1899,.......................2-1/2 per cent.</span>
<span class="l">Total refund to paid-up stockholders,. 90 per cent.</span>
</span>

<p>The Exposition sold and transferred to the Greater America Exposition all its
buildings, appurtenances, engines, apparatus, materials and furniture for the
sum of $17,500.00 and the assumption by the purchasers of all the obligations
to the owners of lands leased for the purposes of the Exposition.</p>

<p>In this connection it is pertinent to note that this Exposition is the only one
in America to promptly open its gates to the public on a completed show on the
day and hour originally designated,- the first to open free from mortgage or
pledge of all or some portion of its gate receipts, the first to make money
each and every month of the exposition, and the first to re-pay to its
stockholders any considerable portion of the funds advanced by them upon which
to base and build the enterprise.In these respects the Trans-Mississippi &amp;
International Exposition stands without a rival.</p>

<p>The Exposition was of great value to Omaha, whereas, at its organization,
dullness and stagnation of business interests ruled, at its close there was
found a proud satisfied people.Proud of the results achieved, a return of
confidence in our present and future, a fresheningof purpose, a renewal of
energy, new resolving of strength for advancement; satisfied that Omaha's
declaration and purpose to hold a great Exposition had been carried out to the
full, and in a most highly commendable and honorable way.</p>

<p>The coming of the Exposition forced the issue of new railway passenger
stations, for which twenty years of effort had hitherto proved fruitless.It
was the most potent cause of the coming of the Illinois Central Ry. to Omaha,
and the planning and decision of the Chicago Great Western System to do
likewise.It caused a widening and broadening of street railway transportation
facilities and comforts, and these things were only a few of the visible
benefits resultant form the denials, sacrifices and labors of those who
assisted in making the Exposition the success it was.</p>

<p>In closing it is but just to call attention to the fact that the success of the
Exposition was due to the feeling general among our people, that it was their
Exposition; that they each had a proprietary and prideful interest in it.This
was supplemented by the care, attention, and assistance of the Board of
Directors.After all, however, the success attained could not have resulted
except for the energetic, untiring, unceasing care and attention given to the
enterprise by the business men comprising the Executive Committee.The real
work, the load of responsibility rested upon them, and to them a very large
share of the credit for results attained should be given.For more than two
years much of their time was given, together with their business knowledge,
experience and judgment, for the best success of the project, and altogether
without emolument or recompense of any sort.</p>

<p>During this period 478 meetings of the executive committee were held, holding
from two hours to five hours each, and at these meetings only the concrete
results of their labors for the Exposition in their business offices were
presented, considered and determined.</p>

<p>In these meetings, for deliberation and decision of the momentous interests of
the Exposition, and at all times, the executive committee was ably assisted by
advice and counsel of the president, whose great interest in and valuable aid
to the enterprise was much appreciated and contributed largely to the results
achieved.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>A fitting conclusion of the affairs of the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition, in connection with and following the final meeting of the Board of
Directors, and carrying out the directions of said meeting was the meeting of
the President and all members of the Executive Committee with the committee
appointed by the directors to secure and present suitable Gold Medals to the
President and members of the Executive Committee.The meeting was held in Room
130 of the Millard Hotel at noon of Wednesday, September 10th, 1902.In this
room some hundreds of meetings of the Executive Committee had been held and it
was chosen because of this fact for the place of formal presentation of the
medals authorized in recognition of their long, faithful and unremunerated
services to the Exposition.There were present Mr. Gurdon W. Wattles,
President.The Executive Committee as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Mr. Zachary T. Lindsay, Chairman.</span>
<span class="l">Mr. Edward Rosewater</span>
<span class="l">Mr. Freeman P. Kirkendall</span>
<span class="l">Mr. Edward E. Bruce</span>
<span class="l">Mr. Abraham L. Reed</span>
<span class="l">Mr. William N. Babcock,</span></span>

<p>and the medals Committee, as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Mr. John A. Wakefield, General Secretary.</span>
<span class="l">Mr. Gilbert M. Hitchcock, Director.</span>
<span class="l">Mr. John C. Wharton, Director.</span></span>

<p>A formal luncheon was served, after which, Mr. G.M. Hitchcock as a one time
member of the Executive Committee arose and addressed the medal recipients as
follows:</p>

<p>Mr. Ex-President and Gentlemen:</p>

<p>I suppose we may properly term ourselves ex-directors of the late
Trans-Mississippi Exposition and I am sure no corporation ever dissolved in the
city of Omaha more happily and more creditably than the one which we closed at
the last meeting of the Board of Directors.At that meeting after listening to
all reports and reviewing the situation, the Board of Directors assigned to Mr.
Wakefield, Mr. Wharton and myself the very pleasant duty of securing and
presenting to the President and each member of the executive committee, a medal
in recognition of distinguished and honorable service to the Exposition and to
Omaha.</p>

<p>In fulfilling this agreeable duty, I believe I can properly say that this
committee represents, not only the Board of fifty directors of the Exposition,
but also the six thousand stock holders, and over and above them the whole
people of this community.These directors, these stockholders and this
community generally tender to you, Gentlemen, in this little souvenir a slight
recognition of your honorable, able and self-sacrificing services, covering a
period of several years.</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Exposition was the product of serious conditions.At the
time the Exposition idea was incubated, and at the time this community formed
the resolution to hold an Exposition, Omaha was suffering from the effects of
the panic of 1893, the crop failure of 1894, as well as the depression of 1895,
and it was the effort to recover from these misfortunes which led the people of
Omaha to resolve to hold an Exposition.At that time Omaha called upon her
best citizens as a state calls upon its soldiers in time of war.You,
Gentlemen, responded.President Wattles and each member of this committee who
became the head of an important department of the Exposition, laid down for a
time the burdens and ambitions of private life and took up the burdens and
responsibilities of public service.You came to the relief of this community
when men of courage and ability were needed, and patiently, persistently, in
the face of discouragements, and in spite of the greatest obstacles, You, as
the responsible officers of this great undertaking, worked it out,- not to an
ordinary success, but to a miraculous achievement.When the Exposition was
closed, viewed in the light of all past Expositions, it had been a wonderful
success, financially and artistically, but in the light of more recent events,
particularly in the light of the sad experience of the Buffalo Exposition, the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition has been magnified until its success, by
comparison with the Buffalo failure, seems almost a miracle.</p>

<p>It would be invidious and serve no good purpose, and it would be also somewhat
presumptuous for me as the spokesman for this committee to attempt comparisons
or to raise distinctions as to the respective value of your services.Each of
you was the head of a great department of this large enterprise.Each of you,
at one time or another, bore the brunt of the struggle.At one time it fell
upon the department of Exhibits; at another time upon the department of
concessions and privileges; at another time upon the department of
transportation; at another time upon the department of buildings and grounds;
at another time upon the department of publicity and promotion; and we
painfully remember how frequently it fell upon the department of ways and
means.Each officer sustained his part and fulfilled his duties individually,
and when the ExecutiveCommittee met and the heads of all departments were
united, the committee spoke as one man and exercised the great powers of the
Exposition with substantial harmony and effect.Had any single department
failed, or had the head any single department faltered, the great enterprise
would have been seriously damaged.But the patience, persistence, ability and
energy displayed by each and all combined to bring about the splendid result.</p>

<p>I am sure, however, that no member of the Executive Committee will question for
a moment the propriety of my remarks when I particularly specify the great
services of the president of this Exposition, who met constantly with the
executive committee, and shared in the labors of the head of each department,
and fulfilled the duty of each in his temporary absence and who, in season and
out of season, subordinated and sacrificed his personal interests and his
private affairs that a great Exposition of which he was the head, might
succeed.Had failure come, we cannot question that upon the shoulders of the
president would have been placed much of the responsibility for disaster simply
from the fact that he occupied first place in the organization, and in the day,
therefore, of its great and final success and in the awarding to your,
Gentlemen, of these mementos of the long fight and great triumph, it is but
proper to give first place to the president who worked with you so effectively.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I now call upon Mr. Wharton to make proper delivery of the medals
ordered for you by authority of the Board of Directors.
occupied first place in the organization, and in the day, therefore, of its
great and final success and in the awarding to your, Gentlemen, of these
mementos of the long fight and great triumph, it is but proper to give first
place to the president who worked with you so effectively.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I now call upon Mr. Wharton to make proper delivery of the medals
ordered for you by authority of the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Mr. John Wharton spoke as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. President, and Gentlemen of the Executive Committee:</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure that we gather round this festal board to day, not
only to partake of the delectable viands set before us, but also to perform the
pleasing duty enjoined by the Board of Directors of the Trans-Mississippi
Exposition, of presenting golden medals to you, Mr. President and Gentlemen
constituting the Executive Committee of the Board as an expression of their
high appreciation and that of the public as well, for the faithful, unselfish
and efficient services rendered by you in carrying to a successful culmination
the mighty and stupendous enterprise known as the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition in the Year of Our Lord, A.D. 1898.</p>

<p>The magnitude and the importance of your Herculanian efforts grow upon us as we
contemplate the adverse circumstances under which you undertook the enterprise,
and the environments which enthralled you as the work progressed.But by your
genius and tenacity you brought order out of chaos, producing the "White City"
situated upon either bank of the tranquil and placid waters of the lagoon,- a
marven of beauty and symmetry, the like of which has never been equaled in the
Exposition world.</p>

<p>Omaha, situated as she is, the gateway of the great Northwest, determined to
demonstrate to the world her strategic position and to produce in beautiful
profusion the products of this vast agricultural area which lies west of the
Mississippi River.After this resolution had been made, the memorable panic of
1893 came upon us, with its blighting effects paralyzing the industries of the
country to such an extent that dearth and stagnation in business were
everywhere manifest.Following in close succession came the drouth of 1894 and
1895 causing still further disaster and calamity to the marts of trade and the
cessation of business enterprises.But, Sirs, you went nobly on, nothing
daunting your courage or impeding your efforts, bringing forth that splendid
exhibit of the products of the Northwest, arranged with such delicacy and
perfection of design, housed in buildings of such marvelousarchitectural
beauty and lighted with such a refulgent blaze of electricity that the millions
who beheld it involuntarily exclaimed.- "Oh, what a dream of beauty!"Yes
indeed, it was "a dream of beauty," the memory of which can never be effaced.</p>

<p>The victories of peace are as great as those of war.Grant had his Appomattox
and Rear Admiral Dewey his Spanish fleet, but their sacrifices, patriotism and
loyalty were not greater than your sacrifices, or the patriotism that you
exhibited in bringing to perfection the mighty and stupendous enterprise
committed to your hand.You labored long and well.You sacrificed your own
business interests, leaving the management of your banking and financial
institutions, wholesale houses and cosmopolitan journals; demonstrating to the
people your patriotism and loyalty for the public good, and with universal
accord the people have viewed the results of your labors and have said,- "Well
done, thou good and faithful servants."</p>

<p>It has been the custom of nations and people to bestow medals and degrees of
honor upon those who have rendered valiant, heroic and distinguished services
to their country, or because of sacrifices have become benefactors of their
race.We approve and commend the practice, and in conformity with that
established custom, and by direction of the Board of Directors of the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition, I have the pleasure of presenting to you,
President Wattles and to you,Messrs. Lindsey, Rosewater, Kirkendall, Bruce,
Reed and Babcock, these beautiful gold medals, (handing to each his respective
medal) as a slight token of our high appreciation of the faithful efficient and
heroic services rendered by you in bringing to such a glorious culmination the
industrial Exposition of 1898.Your success was not merely an artistic one,
but it was a financial one as well, returning as you did ninety cents on the
dollar to every stockholder who invested in the enterprise, and that too when
industrial paralysis and financial depression were sweeping over the commercial
world like the Simoon from Desert, blighting industry and deadening enterprise
like a pall, dearth and depression rested upon us.Yet in the midst of all
this you triumphed,- triumphed because of the personal sacrifices you made,-
because of your unswerving honesty in the management of the undertaking, and
your unalterable determination to crown with glorious success this enterprise,
conceived in weakness and brought forth in such marvelous beauty and
excellence.As time shall roll on and the Macauley of Future years shall
record the history of industrial Expositions, he will render even greater
praise to you for your loyalty, your discerning thought and mature judgment and
your honest management of this Exposition.</p>

<p>We present these medals, not for their intrinsic value but as a testimony of
our regard and appreciation.Let them be kept by you and your posterity as
souvenirs, reminding you and them of the faithful services rendered by you in
connection with the Industrial Exposition of 1898.</p>

<p>The medals, beautiful products of the goldsmith's art, are 14k gold, about four
inches in length by one and three quarters inches wide.The face of the medal
bears a figure of victory with wings and arms outstretched, standing at the
portals of the Hall of Fame, in its uplifted right hand a horseshoe wreath of
Laurel leaves, in the extended left hand a scroll, having engraved thereon this
sentence,- "Gloria action-es cinxit" (Glory surrounds his conduct.)At the top
of the medal in raised letters appear the words, "Omaha" and below the figure,
in blue enameling, the words, "Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.
1898."On the reverse side is engraved in script the words, "Unanimously voted
by the Board of Directors in appreciation of Honorable and Self-sacrificing
Services to the Exposition.The medal proper hangs pendant below two bars, on
the topmost of which appears the name of the recipient and on the second the
words, "President" or "Executive Committee" as the case required.</p>

<p>After a brief season of inspection of the medals and pleasant comment thereon
and thereabout, Mr. Lindsey, Chairman, called upon President Wattles to make
response to the presentation addresses.With deep feeling and evident emotion
Mr. President responded in these words:</p>

<p>Gentlemen of the Presentation Committee, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the
Executive Committee:</p>

<p>A feeling of sadness comes over me as we meet for the last time in this
familiar room to receive these beautiful medals and listen to the words of
praise and commendation so lavishly expressed by the Presentation Committee. 
For myself and for the Executive Committee, I thank you most heartily, and
through you, I thank the Board of Directors for this appropriate expression of
their esteem and appreciation.We will each of us value these beautiful medals
beyond price, and through our lives they will be preserved as reminders of the
confidence and good will of our fellow workers in the enterprise fraught with
many difficulties but crowned with unparalleled success.</p>

<p>It was almost seven years ago that the first steps were taken in the
preliminary work of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, and
those first efforts were difficult in many respects.Many prominent business
men in the community not only refused their support but ridiculed the
enterprise and those connected with it.Those were dark days, and it took
great moral courage to pull against the tide of public opinion, which seemed to
hesitate at so great an undertaking.</p>

<p>It was nearly five years ago that this Executive Committee was organized and
began its meetings in this room.Here has been the scene of many heated
arguments, and here have been settled many of the vital questions which meant
so much for the success or failure of the enterprise.How well these questions
were settled the final success tells the story.As I look back on the many
differences of opinion and on some of the unpleasant experiences, I sometimes
wonder if they were not all for the best, and I believe but for these
differences we might have made many mistakes we avoided.I have heard our plan
of organization criticized, and at times during the Exposition I questioned
whether or not it was the best.This plan of dividing the responsibility among
several heads of departments was proposed by myself, as I was willing and
anxious to distribute the burdens and I am now willing to divide the honors
equally between myself and the members of this committee.The only additional
credit I claim is on account of longer service.I took up the work as a public
duty and simply did my best at all times and under all circumstances.Each
member of the Executive Committee did the same, and as I now look back on what
was accomplished, I do not think the plan of organization could have been
improved.</p>

<p>As we meet for the last time as a committee to receive these honors so
generously bestowed, I can say with a heart filled with gratitude to this
Presentation Committee, that we thank you again for your kind words and for
these beautiful medals, and to the members of the Executive Committee, I wish
you one and all prosperity and happiness throughout your lives.</p>
