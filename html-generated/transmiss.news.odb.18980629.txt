<p>NOTED EDUCATORS CONVENE</p>

<p>Some Interesting Information About People Who Are Participating in the Great Teachers' Meeting.</p>

<p>W. W. Stetson, Ph. D., state superintendent of the schools of Maine, is one of the best known educators of New England. Mr. Stetson was born at Greene, June 17, 1849. He began teaching at the age of 15, and has taught some' part of every year since. He commenced in the district schools of Maine, and in 1868 went to Illinois, where he taught in district, normal and high schools, and finally attained to the position of superintendent of schools. In 1884 he returned to Maine, and in March, 1885, took charge of the Auburn schools, which position he held for ten years.</p>

<p>As a superintendent of schools he enjoyed an enviable reputation for executive ability, a broad grasp of what should be taught, and great fertility in devising methods of instruction. He was noted for not only being abreast of the times on educational subjects, but as an explorer in new fields. His annual reports, in which he elaborated his theory of education, have received the hearty endorsements of leading educators and have been widely noticed in the press. In the line of school work Mr. Stetson always has been prominently connected with educational associations. In Illinois he served as an officer in the Principals' association, and in the State Teachers' association, and was especially instrumental in founding the Northern Illinois State Teachers' association, and was its president for several terms. He has been actively connected with the Maine Pedagogical society. He was its president in 1890-91, when the largest meeting in its history was held at Waterville. He is also an active member and constant worker in the county institutes of the state. He was president of the American Institute of Instruction in 1894, and was appoined state superintendent of the schools of Maine in 1895.</p>

<p>Ex-Secretary of Agriculture Hon. J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska City is known far and wide as the "father of Arbor day," which is now universally observed in the public schools. He is one of the leading authorities on forestry and his address on "The Preservation of Forests and Arbor Day" is on the line of his pet theme. Added to a long record of public honors and of a persistent advocacy of sound money upon which he passed through several campaigns, President Cleveland honored the Nebraskan and the state itself by calling Mr. Morton. to his cabinet as secretary of agriculture. The position was held from March 7, 1893, to March 6, 1897. The following sentences best express, perhaps, more than a review of the Nebraska statesman's public acts, his characteristics with reference to his success in the cause of education: "I find more satisfaction in the results which I have aided in accomplishing by the institution of Arbor day in 1872, and by constantly encouraging tree-planting and forestry in Nebraska and throughout the union, than I do in the recollection of complimentary nominations bestowed or political prominence achieved. There ought to be more patriotic pride in accomplishing, as a private citizen, something useful and desirable for the common-wealth than in having the commonwealth distinguish one by exalting him to continuous office-holding. It is better to be useful to the state as one of its efficient citizens in private life than it is to acquire distinction as a mere recipient of the favors of the state."</p>

<p>Miss Maud Summers, principal of Kinzie school, is regarded as one of the ablest school principals of Chicago. She has had large experience in addressing teachers and others upon educational topics, and has taught successfully in teachers' institutes. Miss Summers recently spent a year studying in Europe. She is a member of the Chicago Woman's club and kindred organizations. She was chosen to address the National Educational convention as a representative of Chicago Women's club, but was compelled to decline on account of being called to the Drake university summer School of Methods in July.</p>

<p>President George A. Gates of Iowa college, Grinnell, has for the last eleven years been at the head of this eminently successful institution of learning. He is a Vermonter by birth, graduating from St. Johns-bury academy in 1869, Dartmouth college in 1873, and Andover seminary in 1880. He spent two years traveling abroad observing the educational methods of the great seats of learning. He became a minister, and was pastor of the Congregational church in Upper Montclair, N. J., from 1880 to 1887, since which time he has been at Grinnell. Grinnell college is this year celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of its existence, and it is due in some measure to Prof. Gates' efforts that it has made such favorable progress. The president achieved some notoriety through a fight in the courts over a publication of his anent the American Book company. The case was lost, the judge ruling it out of court on legal grounds, maintaining that the pamphlet was not libelous, as was charged. President Gates is a man with the courage of his convictions, and he still maintains that the book was needed.</p>

<p>Albion W. Small, head of the department of sociology in the University of Chicago, has become widely known in that position since he accepted the chair in 1892.

He spent a year at the University of Berlin and a year at the University of Leipsic. Ile is the editor of the American Journal of Sociology. Through his writings Prof. Small has be-' come known to the great educators the country over. The professor created some excitement at the meeting of the National Educational association at Milwaukee last year by an address, in which he maintained that the school systems, notably that of Chicago, legally paralyzes teachers' power to make pupils learn that there are laws which all must respect and obey whether they want to or not. Such systems, he maintained, are doing their best to make anarchists instead of good American citizens.</p>

<p>Major Aaron Gove has been at the head of the schools of Denver for twenty-five years and has earned an enviable reputation as an educator. He is considered an authority on the financial management of schools and has built up the system in Denver to a high grade of efficiency He was graduated A. M. from Dartmouth in 1876, and L.L.

<p>Mrs. Ella F. Young, assistant superin tendent of the schools of Chicago, Is $ prominent educator. She has spent her professional life in the Chicago public schools. Though limited to the schools of one city, her experience has been as broad as that city offers. She has been an elementary school teacher, a high and a normal school teacher, a principal of a grammar school, with a membership of over 1,500 pupils, and an assistant superintendent. In her present position she has thirty-two schools, containing over 20,000 children, and between 500 and 600 teachers

His changes have all been promotions that have come to him unsought. He has taught in more than twenty-five normal institutes, has been president of the Iowa State Teachers' association and of many smaller educational conventions and has been a frequent contributor to the educational journals of the country. Perhaps his best work was done at Harlan, Ia., where he was superintendent of schools for eleven years.

He was elected in 1895 to represent the Fortieth senatorial district in the assembly. Having taken much interest in school matters and delivered a paper before the State Teachers' association on the subject, "What Can the Legislature Do for Our Schools," which greatly pleased the educational people of the state, they urged -upon Lieutenant Governor Milliman to make him chairman of the committee on schools. This position was filled by him during the regular session of the Twenty-sixth, and also the session of the Twenty-seventh General assembly. The school laws were thoroughly revised and many new and important features were introduced.
In the Twenty-seventh General	assembly there was considerable agitation of the question of state
publication of school books.

In university courses and before some of the brainy audiences of the entire country Major Merwin has lectured to their intense delight and edification. His presence at the Transmississippi convention is a great card and those who anticipate an intellectual treat are not going to be disappointed in the least. J. W. Henninger, superintendent of the Jacksonville, Ill., schools, wrote this: "It was indeed an inspiration to hear the masterly analysis and the eloquent resume of the orator as the world's greatest poet passed in review before us. It was a presentation of a great subject by one who had brought to the occasion the insight of a lifetime of wide reading, extended travel, careful study and world-wide experience."</p>
