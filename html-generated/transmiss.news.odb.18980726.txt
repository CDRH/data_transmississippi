<p>May Get the Mexican Band.</p>

<p>A proposition has been received from the Mexican band to begin an engagement August 10, when Phinney's band will leave, It is announced that it will be accepted provided that an arrangement can be made by which the band can be brought here without a collision with the United States law which prohibits the Importation of foreign labor under contract. Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department telegraphed to Secretary Gage of the treasury last night in regard to the matter and subsequent negotiations with the band will depend largely on the nature of his reply.</p>
