<p>PREFACE</p>

<p>FROM the moment the success of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition of 1898 was assured, there was manifested a popular desire that a history of the great project be published. Every officer and nearly every director felt that a permanent record of the grand achievement should be made, not only to preserve a faithful portrayal of its artistic triumphs, but also to contain a chronicle of the deeds of the men of the West who planned, fashioned and conducted to its consummation one of the greatest public enterprises known to the annals of the Trans-Mississippi region.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Board of Directors, October 7, 1898, Gen. Charles F. Manderson offered a resolution, which was adopted, providing that material for a history of the Exposition he collected and that the sum of $10,000 be appropriated with which to defray the expense of publication. The resolution authorized the President to appoint a Committee on History, composed of three members of the directory. This committee was empowered to employ a suitable person as historian: to disburse the fund as needed; to approve the manuscript and illustrations prepared for publication, and to fix the quality of binding. It was provided, further, that a copy of the history be placed in the Omaha Public Library; one in the library of the University of Nebraska; one in the library of the Omaha High School, and one in the library of Creighton College.</p>

<p>President Wattles appointed to membership on the Committee on History three directors, viz., Gen. Charles F. Manderson, Chairman; Charles W. Lyman and Isaac W. Carpenter. The committee entered upon the discharge of its duties, but was soon restrained from further action by a writ of injunction based upon the claim that the articles of Incorporation did not specifically grant authority to publish a history. The claim was contested, but the court issued a writ of permanent injunction.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors met June 30, 1902. Chairman Lindsey of the Executive Committee made a report showing a small cash balance remaining on hand; that the Executive Committee recommended that said balance be paid to the Secretary as additional compensation for services rendered, and for the preparation of a "statement of the organization, operation, management and results of the Exposition, which statement shall be submitted by him to a committee consisting of Gen. Charles F. Manderson, Chairman; Isaac W. Carpenter, Charles W. Lyman. Carroll S. Montgomery and Edward Rosewater, to be revised and approved by said committee." The report of

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.014.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.014.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.014.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the committee was unanimously adopted. Secretary Wakefield made a compilation of the salient facts of the subject consisting largely of a series of reports of departmental managers, transcripts of reports of proceedings of the meetings of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors, and a chronicle of the events incident to the programs of special days. The compilation proved invaluable in the preparation of this history.</p>

<p>A determination to publish a history of the Exposition was not reached until the fall of 1907—nine years after the close of the gates. The matter came up in an incidental way at a complimentary dinner at the Omaha Club tendered by President Wattles to the directors of the Exposition. Very naturally, the guests indulged in a recital of anecdote and reminiscence relating to the Exposition season, which led to many expressions of a desire that a history be published. General Manderson, Chairman of the Committee on History, was asked to take the preliminary steps in arranging for the preparation of a history, leaving to individuals the option of subscribing funds with which to meet the necessary expense. Upon request, James B. Haynes formulated an outline of proposed chapters, which was submitted to the committee, the sketch being approved. Pursuant thereto the history was written. An important part of the work was written by George E. Bidwell, a director, who had been appointed to the vacancy in the Revision Committee caused by the death of Edward Rosewater. Mr. Bidwell wrote Chapters II and III and he also compiled Part II. The chapter on Architecture was largely prepared by C. Howard Walker and Thomas R. Kimball, Architects-in-chief of the Exposition. The remaining chapters were written by Mr. Haynes, who planned the entire work. Most of the photographs were furnished by Frank A. Rinehart, who was official photographer of the Exposition. About a dozen of the illustrations were made from photographs kindly loaned by E. L. Lomax, General Passenger Agent of the Union Pacific Railway; a few small cuts were made from photographs taken by E. E. Muffitt, by whose courtesy we were permitted to use them.</p>

<p>PROGRESS OF THE WEST</p>

<p><em class="hi">"The mission of the Exposition is to communicate to mankind
the impulses to which it owes its origin."</em></p>

<p>—John J. INGALLS.</p>

<p>DURING the prosperous years antedating the Chicago World's Fair, when the West made unexampled progress, there was an oft-expressed desire that an interstate exposition might be held in Omaha. The suggestion contemplated only a sectional exhibit of the products and industries of Nebraska and adjoining States, and was born of a knowledge of the wealth-producing power of this region, and of an urgent call for the spreading of that knowledge throughout the East. The World's Fair of 1893 was a revelation to the people of the nation. Its unprecedented success inspired leading men of population centers in the West to project similar enterprises in spite of the depressing effects of a financial panic then felt throughout the whole country. California erected a mid-winter exposition, a State enterprise, which opened its gates in San Francisco in January, 1894. Kansas City began to advocate the holding of a mid-continent exposition. Denver proposed to hold a Western States' exposition, and raised a large fund for the purpose, but upon further consideration postponed work to a future date, intending to celebrate the purchase of Louisiana Territory from France. Texas planned to have a Western and Southern States' exposition at Galveston. Minneapolis and St. Paul contemplated a Northwestern States' exposition. and had begun the work of a promotion.</p>

<p>Public-spirited men of Omaha took note of the progress of the agitation for a Western exposition, and determined to protect Omaha's interests in the matter. In the fall of 1894 the Trans-Mississippi Congress held its annual session in St. Louis, composed of representative men of Western States, who

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.018.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.018.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.018.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>
                
assembled to discuss measures designed to promote the commercial and material interests of the region they represented. Its delegates held credentials from governors of States and from mayors of the larger cities. The Nebraska delegation in that Congress presented a formal invitation to the Congress to meet in Omaha the following year, which was accepted. Late in November of 1895 the Congress assembled in Omaha. The Nebraska delegation named a committee of five to prepare proposed resolutions to be presented to the Congress, the object of which was to obtain official approval of the proposal to hold an exposition at Omaha intended to measure the progress of the Trans-Mississippi States. Hon. William J. Bryan, chosen as the spokesman of the committee, introduced the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted:</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Monarch of the Plains</p>
 
</div>

<p>"WHEREAS, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the States west of the Mississippi River, made at some central gateway where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth-producing States, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi States. but to all the homeseekers in the world; therefore,</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the United States Congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha during the months of August, September and October, in the year 1898. and that the representatives of such States and Territories in Congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in carrying out this enterprise."</p>

<p>In the assembly which adopted the resolution after debate there were delegates from Minnesota, Missouri, Colorado and Utah. Returning to their respective homes they reported the adoption of the resolution, which was enough to check the efforts then being made in some of those States to gain recognition for an exposition city. Thus the Trans-Mississippi Congress paved the way for the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition which was held at Omaha from June to November, 1898.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.019.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.019.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.019.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The Bryan resolution set out in broad terms the object and scope of the proposed exposition. Later on, upon the organization of the corporate body, the projectors reiterated the purposes of the enterprise and expanded the limits of territory which it was intended to represent "to any State or Territory in the United States," and contemplated exhibits by the federal government and by foreign States, "for the purpose, particularly, of exhibiting to the world the products, industries and capabilities of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi River."</p>

<p>President Wattles, in a public address, referring to the objects of the exposition, said: "The Commercial Congress which authorized this exposition wisely conceived its object to he the advancement of the commercial interests of the West. It is a demonstration of the marvelous resources of the great West."</p>

<p>In his oration, which marked the ceremonies of the opening day of the exposition, John N. Baldwin made use of these words: "The purpose of this exposition is to display the products, manufactures and industries of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi River. The territory embraced is two-thirds of the area of the Union."</p>

<p>The first occasion for a ceremonial was the laying of the cornerstone of the Arch of States' entrance, originally intended to be a permanent structure built of stone from each of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories.</p>

<p>Thus from the record we are enabled to see the original scope of the Exposition, and while Eastern and Southern States and foreign nations, together with our newly-acquired insular possessions, being invited to participate, installed exhibits and erected buildings, yet the prime object of the projectors was "to demonstrate to the world the products, industries and civilization of the States west of the Mississippi River." In furthering such object the people of the whole West soon made known their willingness to participate, and in every way possible to aid the men who had assumed the enormous burden involved in building the Exposition. The West, conscious of its strength and of its wealth-producing resources not yet developed, was of one mind as to the wisdom and necessity of making an extraordinary effort to attract the attention of the people of the East by a colossal object-lesson of the marvelous development of the natural resources of the country between the Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountains since the close of the Civil War.</p>

<p>President McKinley, in his telegram to the Exposition builders on the opening day, gave evidence of his sympathy with the objects sought to be attained. He said: "The events of the memorable half-century which the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition commemorates are interwoven with the history of the whole nation and are of surpassing importance.

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.020.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.020.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.020.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

The mighty West affords most striking evidence of the splendid achievements and possibilities of our people. It is a matchless tribute to the energy and endurance of the pioneer, while its vast agricultural development, its progress in manufactures, its advancement in the arts and sciences and in all departments of education and endeavor have been inestimable contributions to the civilization and wealth of the world."</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>William McKinley</p>
 
</div>

<p>Our President realized, as did the projectors of the Exposition, that its mission was to illustrate the achievements and possibilities of the people of the West. The completed Exposition gave indisputable evidence that its mission was successful.</p>

<p>It would be interesting and profitable in this connection to make a brief study of influences and forces which operated for more than a generation in

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.021.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.021.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.021.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

fixing the foundations of greatness; in promoting the growth and upbuilding of the West, and in facilitating the march of progress of its people. It may be worth while to glance at the prime factors which entered into the development of Nature's storehouse, by which were produced conditions making an Exposition possible, for in the last analysis the unrivaled success of the Omaha Exposition is found to be due primarily to the accumulated wealth of Western States which was derived from natural products of the earth in one form or another. Chronicles of the West confirm the fact that the beginning of every settlement depended upon the success of efforts to till the soil. Pioneers from Eastern States ascended the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries, bringing horses, plows and seed-corn, venturing all they possessed upon the chance of success of the first crop ever planted in those fertile valleys. That eminent Nebraskan, the late J. Sterling Morton, who was the foremost patron of agriculture in the West, discussing the part played by tillers of the soil in laying the foundations of this State, said: "All wealth and true capital must arise from agricultural development. Out of the soil alone is all true and substantial independence to be derived. Agriculture is the basis upon which the superstructure of commerce is reared. Everywhere throughout the West were brawny arms lifted up to strike the earth, that a stream of plenty and contentment might flow forth and bless the country."</p>

<p>In all of the prairie States the breaking-teams with the big sod-plows were in the van of industry. Thousands of men, attracted by the reports of discoveries of gold and silver in the mountains, traversed and examined the plains, finding that much of the land lying within the boundaries of the so-called Great American Desert was tillable. In this way the historic migration of pioneers to Pike's Peak, following Col. William Gilpin's discovery of gold on Cherry Creek (Denver) in 1858, revealed to the world the limitless possibilities of agriculture west of the Missouri River. Missourians began to settle in Kansas, where they devoted all their energies to plowing and planting corn. Their success was heralded throughout the East, where companies were organized to form colonies. and their success in Kansas led to the organization of many similar companies in the Northern States. Many of these colonists settled in Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska, and by the close of the war there began a mighty inrush of discharged soldiers and other ambitious men into the prairie States. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills in the early '70's caused another notable migration of men, which attracted the attention of the country to the vast reaches of farming land in the Dakotas and in Nebraska. So it was when silver and gold were discovered in the mountains of Montana. The precious metals have proved to be magnets which drew the people into remote sections of

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.022.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.022.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.022.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the wilderness, invariably resulting in the discovery and settlement of large
areas of farming lands in various sections of the West. It may be important
to note the fact, in passing, that the men who pioneered the West in whatever
pursuit were native Americans who had inherited from their forefathers the
true national spirit. They wrested Texas from Mexico only to turn it over
to the protection of the American flag, as they did in the conquest of
California. They braved the dangers of the Oregon trail and established
settlements on the lower Columbia, where they planted the American flag
on territory over which Great Britain had asserted a right of sovereignty for
nearly fifty years. So it was with the early history of every Western State.
Invariably the founders of these new commonwealths were native Americans
determined to take part in the great movement of territorial expansion in
the region west of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Coincident with the rush of settlers into the West from nearly all of
the Eastern States in the years during and after the close of the Civil War,
came liberal homestead laws passed by Congress under the policy of "free
homes for the million." These laws, together with the advent of the railroads
west of the river, gave a fresh impetus to immigration. The Government
awarded land grants to the pioneer railroads in some of the prairie States,
which led to an era of unexampled railroad building and consequent development of agricultural resources. After the pioneers had given testimony to
the men of the East that the possibilities of development of natural resources
were beyond computation, it would seem that the energy and power of the
whole nation were exerted to provide the means of settling the region whose
wonderful progress was illustrated by the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. No
factor in this era of marvelous progress was comparable with that of the
railroads. In 1860 there were but 2,100 miles of railway west of the
Mississippi, and less than thirty miles of completed track west of the Missouri
River. In 1870, in seven States between the Great Lakes and the mountains,
there were 10,466 miles of track. In 1898 the mileage of railroads west of
the Mississippi River was over 80,000, costing over two billion dollars.</p>

<p>The new lands of America have, from the year of the completion of the
first railroad, waited for transportation facilities, which, when they came, 
seemed to run in advance of material progress. Development of the land
depended largely upon the railroad, which not only increased the population,
but afforded a means of reaching the best markets for the products of the
farm. The railroads induced foreign emigrants to settle in the West, showed
them the land and convinced them of its possibilities, in many cases furnishing seed-wheat and choice breeding stock free. The railroad, at this early

stories of the fertility of the soil. The railroads were extended out into the
uninhabited prairie or the trackless forest, inviting population to follow,
assuming the role of immigration agent, sending out far and wide into the
highways and byways of America and Europe, bidding the people to come
in and settle upon the lands that had thus been opened up to them. The
story of the work of the railroads, in developing the wheat industry of Minnesota and the Dakotas, is of itself a chapter of absorbing interest, for it is typical of the part played by every railroad in the West in fostering and developing the agricultural resources of the country.</p>

<p>AGRICULTURE</p>

<p>One of the chief objects of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition was to show
the progress of the development of agriculture. The extraordinary exhibits
of productiveness were intended to convey a clear idea of the wealth-producing
power of the farms and ranges attained up to the year 1898.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

<p>Estimates based upon the most reliable returns available place the annual value of products of the area described at a thousand million dollars, derived from cultivated
farms, aggregating sixty-seven million acres. These broad prairies, at one time said to be incapable of cultivation, in 1898 produced twelve hundred million bushels of corn, three hundred and fifty million bushels of wheat, two hundred and twenty-three million bushels of oats and thirty million tons of hay, in value aggregating six hundred million dollars. Other products raise the grand total of $755,200,242. There were nine million
horses and mules, thirty-two million cattle, fifty-one million hogs and sheep,
the value of the annual product of live stock being twelve hundred million
dollars. The annual wool product was estimated at seventy million pounds.</p>

<p>In considering the chief factors which contributed to make the prairie
States the granary of the world, it is necessary to mention the self-binding
reaper and harvester which appeared in 1876, for it is said to have advanced
the frontier line of civilization many miles each year. It is not too much to
say that the successful introduction of the reaper into the grain fields of this
country added millions of dollars to the value of our annual harvest by
enabling us to secure the whole product and to enlarge the area of our wheat

fields with certainty of being able to gather the crop. The introduction of
labor-saving farm machinery of every description had tremendous influence in increasing total production of grain. The same may be said of the scientific experiments made by the Government, as illustrated in its splendid exhibit at Omaha. In 1862 Congress granted land to each State, proceeds of sale of which to go to agricultural and mechanical colleges. These institutions have had their part in promoting agriculture.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

<p>Up to the year 1890 the value of farm property had reached fabulous proportions. Government statisticians reported the aggregate value of farm property in twenty States and Territories west of the Great Lakes at $7,185,588,223. The figures for 1900 show an increase in ten years of over 25 per cent. Perhaps tit would be fair to add 20 per cent to the above sum in order to reach an estimate of the total value of farm property at the date of the Omaha Exposition, which would give us the colossal sum of $8,622,705,867. This is more than the total of farm property in all the States and Territories in 1860.</p>

<p>MINING</p>

<p>A large share of the rapid progress of the West within the era outlined
at the beginning of this chapter is due to the development of mineral resources.
As was the case in California in '49, the discovery of rich deposits of precious metals in the Rocky Mountain States attracted thousands of prospectors and miners, who began to lay the foundations of the mining industry, which has grown to enormous proportions.
The Western States produce practically  all of the precious metals found in the United States. In 1860 so few people were living in these mountain

States that the census takers did not count them. The rush of prospectors into Colorado had begun a year or two before, but little had been done in
founding the mining industry. in that State, which is the largest producer
of minerals among the States and Territories. Little was then known of the
valuable mineral deposits of Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Idaho and South
Dakota, although a few prospectors had by that time located claims and some
sensational discoveries had been made. Note has been taken of the first
discovery of gold in Colorado in 1858, but the inrush of prospectors was
delayed until the following summer. The world-famed placer diggings of
Alder Gulch, Montana, were discovered in 1859, destined to produce, all told, gold valued at sixty-five million dollars. Some years later the Mormon 
settlers in Utah began to prospect for gold and silver with great success, attracting thousands of emigrants, some of whom joined prospectors from Montana and penetrated the mountains of Idaho, where rich mineral deposits were found.

</div>

Early in the '70's gold was discovered
in the Black Hills of South Dakota, which attracted the attention of the whole
country for a time. These several discoveries produced an immense migration
into those regions, and by 1870 they contained a population of 145,000.
From that time the growth of the mining industry in the West has been
phenomenal. The aggregate amount of wealth produced is so large that it

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.027.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.027.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.027.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

almost challenges belief. Progress made in Colorado is illustrated by the
fact that in 1891 the total revenue derived from the mines was thirty-three
and a half million dollars. In 1899 the State produced gold and silver
valued at $$5,284.327. At that time the total bullion produced was over
three hundred million dollars. Utah produced in 1877 gold, silver, copper
and lead valued at $7,237,833; in 1891 the output had grown to $12,265,112,
and in 1898 the total production of those materials in Utah was valued at
$9,347,826. The oldest mining camp in that State has produced fifty million
dollars in gold, silver and lead. The value of gold and silver produced in
Montana in 1899 was $25,571.090 Up to 1892 Butte alone had produced,
all told, gold, silver, copper and lead valued at over two hundred million
dollars. During the Exposition year Idaho produced gold and silver valued
at $6,869,105; South Dakota $6,657,751; California about seventeen million;
Oregon and Washington nearly three million; Arizona nearly five million
and Nevada over three million.</p>

<p>Every one of the mining States produces a large variety of valuable
minerals, one State having 208 different kinds. All produce coal in greater
or less quantity. One State has the greatest onyx mine in the world; another
has the largest deposits of marble; another embraces a region of country
in the hills, a hundred miles square, which is the richest in the world, containing the largest and most easily worked mass of low-grade ore yet discovered;
another State has a mountain of iron ore, the largest single deposit in the
world.</p>

<p>In 1899 the total product of gold in the States west of the Mississippi
River was valued at $71.053.400; and of silver $70,806,626. Those States
produced that year coal weighing two hundred and twenty-seven million
tons, iron ore weighing nearly twenty-five million tons and over fifty-seven
million barrels of petroleum. The value of the coal was over thirty million
dollars and the value of copper and other minerals produced that year was
about one hundred million dollars.</p>

<p>MANUFACTURES</p>

<p>It was inevitable that the vast storehouse of materials needed by the
people would give rise to a great manufacturing industry throughout the
West, especially in those States having an abundant supply of fuel. The
wonderful development of natural resources ushered in a remarkable era of
manufacturing west of the Great Lakes, due partially to the discovery of
new sources of metals, coal, petroleum, and to the vast forests north and
south, which produced an unlimited amount of building materials; and due
in some measure to the rapid growth of transportation facilities by, rail and

by water, and to an ambition to become
independent of the East in the production of 
many articles of common use. Therefore,
since the Civil War, the center of manufacturing has steadily moved westward.
For twenty years prior to the Omaha
Exposition there had been great industrial
expansion in the West, and the increase of
population was so rapid that consumption
kept pace with the annual product, while the
number of persons employed in manufacturing, 
mechanical and mining industries had
increased materially. The period cited was
most prolific of inventions, which gave
an unprecedented impetus to the manufactures.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate the rapid growth of industries of the twenty years ending with
1900, the value of the annual product of a number of representative Western cities is given as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list"><span class="l">1880. 1900.</span>
<span class="l">Denver .............................. $ 9,367,749 $ 41,368,698</span>
<span class="l">Des Moines .............................. 4,220,709 10,488,189</span>
<span class="l">Kansas City ............................. 6,382,681 36,527,391</span>
<span class="l">Minneapolis .......................... 29,973,476  110,943,043</span>
<span class="l">Omaha ................................... 4,280,866 43,168,876</span>
<span class="l">St. Louis ........................... 114,333,375, 233,629,733</span>
<span class="l">St. Paul ............................... 10,268,363 38,541,030</span>
<span class="l">Salt Lake City ........................... 1,610,133 6,109,409</span>
<span class="l">San Francisco ......................... 77,801,949 133,069,416</span></span>

<p>In twenty States and Territories west of the Great Lakes the aggregate
value of manufactured products had reached fabulous proportions in 1900,
the increase in ten years being about 75 per cent. No other part of
the country enjoyed so large a percentage of increase. The figures of the
United States census afford a basis for a fair estimate of the total value of
manufactured products in the region outlined for the year 1898, the State of
Illinois leading all the others. The territory embraced extends from the
Gulf to the Lakes and westward to the Pacific Coast. This vast domain
produced, during the exposition year from native raw materials, manufactured
articles aggregating in value the sum of $2,535,159,961.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.029.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.029.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.029.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>These figures are indicative of the limitless resources of the country and
the great possibilities of the future. To exploit these facts and to disseminate
them throughout the world, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition was projected.
They tell a marvelous story of progress and development never before attained 
in this or any other country.</p>

<p>AGGREGATE WEALTH</p>

<p>Some years ago a Nebraska statesman said: "We are riding upon the
head wave of American enterprise, but our descendants, living here a century
hence, will he in the center of American commerce—the mid-ocean of our
national greatness and prosperity." There is nothing more interesting in
the world of modern effort than the solid achievements of the men who are
building up the West and who are making of it a great empire. It was
Americans and sons of Americans who first settled up the West and put
their stamp upon its institutions. Invariably the foreigner came in later and
together they took up the work of producing wealth. The results of their
labors can not be measured in dollars and cents alone, but in that branch endeavor
they have made wonderful progress. Soon
after the year of the Omaha
Exposition was
gathered the facts figures for the federal census of 1900, and the best statistics obtainable are thus given: In twenty-two States
and Territories of the West the aggregate 
value of real property
was $17,176,560,181, 
while the value of all
property reported had
reached the colossal sum 
of $29,082,817,660. 
This exceeds the total
estimated wealth of the

whole country as reported in the census of 1870. It was produced and
accumulated by a population of 21,404,103.</p>

<p>In passing, it may be well to make brief reference to the preponderance
of values of agricultural products over and above the aggregate value of the
products of the mines. While these are the prime sources of wealth and the
West owes its greatness to both, it is interesting to observe that the part
played by the prairie States in the production of wealth is much larger than
that of the mining States wherein agriculture was not yet fully developed.
Covering the territory for which these estimates are made. the aggregate
value of the products of the farm during the year of the Exposition was
$755,200,242; while the mines produced $271,859,026.</p>

<p>From these evidences of material progress the reader may derive an
insight into the wealth-producing power of the country which projected the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition. While the province of an exposition is to
illustrate the resources of the region it represents, it must show also the
capabilities of the people in the arts and industries, and illustrate in many
ways the state of civilization attained by the people who developed the conntry,
It must show what had been done in the field of science. invention. education,
religion, culture, society, fine arts, music, etc. Perhaps the thousands of
visitors who viewed the educational exhibits did not realize the fact that the
Exposition represented one hundred and twenty-one universities and colleges,
sixty-two thousand school houses and nearly six million school children.
There was no exhibit on the grounds which made evident the fact of the
existence of forty-five thousand religious organizations with a membership
of three and a half million worshipers, who had erected forty-four thousand
church edifices in the Western States, yet these figures give the true measure
if of the progress of religion and education since the advent of the pioneer
missionary, whose virtues are extolled in the annals of the founding of
civilization west of the Great Lakes. Interesting as were the exhibits of the
work of the pupils of the public schools as indicating the character of instruction, the showing made of the work done in the colleges in teaching horticulture and agriculture was one of highest importance, as it illustrated the
value of scientific instruction as applied to the practical work of agriculture,
fruit-growing and forestry. These items are given in order to throw a new
light upon the Western farmer, who had for years devoted his spare time to 
the study of scientific methods of tilling the soil. The work accomplished
by Western agricultural experiment stations was set forth in the exhibits
to great advantage, as was that of a vast number of agricultural societies
and farmers' institutes, which for twenty years had grown rapidly in number
and influence.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.032.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.032.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.032.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>One of the most important lessons of the Exposition was that which
taught the masses the great value of the application of art to the products
of industry. A great deal had been written about industrial art, but there
was little to be seen in the way of its product. In the Exposition enough
was shown to emphasize the importance of cultivating artistic knowledge
in industrial callings. The exhibits illustrated the fact that art played an
important part in promoting industrial development, and gave proofs that
Western people were keenly alive to the value of instruction in the fine arts,
and appreciated the influence of art as applied to the products of industry
generally.</p>

<p>The spirit of the West has ever been manifest in all the great undertakings of the people. The constant effort seemed to be to build firm foundations for future greatness, and while the chief concern of all was the development of natural resources in order that wealth and strength might be gained, yet there has ever been present in the minds of men who laid the beginnings of communities and fostered the growth of States, an expressed desire to encourage every agency for the cultivation of good morals and the
refinement of society. The history of frontier mining camps confirms this
salient fact, for the better element of men invariably gained the ascendency
in every settlement, however remote, with the result that the rough and
dissolute characters who dominated the camps in early days were either 
subdued by hemp or forced to move on. The annals of Virginia City and
Leadville need only to be cited to illustrate the certain tendency of Americans
to compel observance of the laws of well-ordered society, and to pave the
way for the civilizing influences of the East, under which they were reared.
As a consequence of the national spirit of the people, the West founded a
great system of education through laws which set apart a portion of the
public lands for purposes of endowment of universities, high and common
schools, mechanical and agricultural. colleges. These means of affording
classical, technical and primary instruction were provided for, as a rule, in
one form or another, at the earliest practicable day in the life of new
communities. Some of the mountain States founded schools of mining with a
degree of success no less marked than that of the agricultural colleges of
the prairie States. It is not too much to say that the intellectual life of the
West kept pace in point of development with agencies employed in the pursuit
of wealth, and while the Exposition may not have illustrated in full degree
the advancement of society in moral and spiritual attainments,it did display
many exhibits which made evident the fact that the people of the West had
a due appreciation of the value of intellectual development; of art in various
forms of expression; of the growth and encouragement of religion; of every

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.033.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.033.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.033.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

means of social culture and refinement: of fostering benevolent and charitable
institutions, and the Exposition sought to make these facts apparent, not only 
by the display of exhibits, but by means of numerous congresses and conventions, each of which contributed its share of testimony to prove the deep interest felt by the people in all efforts made to improve moral and educational standards.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition was located on a plateau of ground with an area of one hundred and eighty-four acres, irregular in shape, and well within the city limits of Omaha, twelve minutes from the business center of the city by either of three lines of electric trains. It was made up of three tracts, known as the Kountze tract, a parallelogram, two thousand five hundred and ninety feet in length, six hundred and eighty feet in width, area forty-three acres, its longer axis being east and west, bounded on the east by Sherman Avenue with its electric car line, on the north by Pickney Street.  On this tract was located the Grand Court, embracing the main exhibition buildings. Adjoining this tract on the east was the so-called Bluff tract, with area of thirty-eight acres, three thousand four hundred and forty-seven feet in length, nine hundred and fifty feet in width near its southerly extremity, tapering to a point at its northerly extremity, its longer axis being at right angles to the Kountze tract, bounded on the east by the main line of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company; on
the west was the so-called North tract, irregular in shape, with an area of eighty-seven acres, its longest axis both north and south and east and west being about two thousand feet in length—bounded on the east by Sherman and Commercial Avenues, with their electric car lines; on the north by Ames Avenue, with its electric car line, and on the west by Twenty-fourth Street,

with its electric car line. On this tract were located the Live Stock Exhibit, the West Midway and various concessions. The contiguity of these three tracts being broken, various smaller tracts of a total area of sixteen acres were acquired to provide avenues of communication between them.</p>

<p>This aggregation of grounds included an extreme length north and south of a trifle over a mile, and an extreme width east and west of about three-quarters of a mile, yet the grouping of the various classes of buildings and exhibits, and the location of the various classes of entertainment with the Grand Court and the Government building as the radiating center of attraction, were such that the visitor was conscious of no weariness in seeking to avail himself of every opportunity to surfeit himself with knowledge and amusement.</p>

<p>As will appear elsewhere in this history, and in a more appropriate
setting, the Trans·Mississippi territory of the United States, while at the
zenith of its marvelous development of empire, had suffered a grievous set-back during the years immediately preceding the inception of this great
Exposition by reason of unprecedented drouth and failure of crops. The
State of Nebraska, which had stood in the foremost rank with the States in
development. also appeared to be the central zone of adversity. Its metropolis,
Omaha, to whose destiny fell the creation and carrying out of the exhibition
of the marvelous development of the first half·century of the existence of the
Trans-Mississippi territory, seemed to be the center of adversity of her State.
The upwards of two millions of persons passing through the gates of the
Exposition and viewing from every standpoint the grandeur of the creation
as an entirety, could have had no conception of the actual conditions prevailing when the genius of its management first took hold of the enterprise. The historian must be true to his trust. It was then regarded as a melancholy
fact that the blocks of beautiful city lots which became the site of this great
Exposition had been. during the years of depression, relegated to the culture
of corn, that their owners might tide themselves over the financial shoals to
the new era of prosperity and advancement which the true Westerner could
always see behind the darkest clouds. And from these fields of corn the
transformation into the beauteous scenes of the Exposition took place.</p>

<p>To prepare the reader for a proper conception of the various elements
which contributed to the grandeur and beauty of the entire scene, it may be
stated here that a radical departure was made from the almost universal
practice in the creation of previous expositions in many details. The concentration of the groupings of the various features of exhibits and amusements has just been referred to. An element of uniformity in height of buildings and the rectangular form of the main buildings, without detracting from the widest field for display of genius in details of facade and ornamentation,

contributed not a little to the glory of the scene as an entirety. In the field
of electric illumination the radical departure from the use of the arc light
to that of the incandescent lamp added greatly to the success of the creation.
Other equally radical departures from former practice were made with great
risk and much concern, but out of it came cordial congratulation, and the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition has become a recognized
model for emulation. Be it remembered that local Omaha genius was very
largely the source of the originality which prevailed in every department of
the Exposition.</p>

<p>The main entrance to the Exposition grounds was through the Arch of
States, located at the intersection of Twentieth Street with the north line of
Pinckney Street, being midway of the south line of the Kountze tract. The
original conception of this Arch of States was to construct it of materials
contributed by each of the Trans-Mississippi States, but from various causes
the carrying out of this plan failed, though it was one of the most noticeable
in the group of structures. It was fifty feet in width, twenty-five feet in
depth and sixty feet in height to the top of the parapet. In form it was
that of a triumphal arch. the opening being twenty feet in width and thirty-five feet in height to the keystone. It was decorated with a frieze composed of
the coats-of-arms of the Trans-Mississippi States, the whole being surmounted
by sculptured figures bearing the shield of the United States. The gay effect
of streamers flying from the top of this arch formed a brilliant object, which
attracted attention from points of view throughout a wide area.</p>

<p>Entering the grounds through this arch, the visitor found himself transported to a fairyland of splendor far beyond any conception of his childhood days. While modern ingenuity had produced many spots appropriately termed fairylands, Venice being the crowning ideal of most travelers in home and foreign lands, yet there were those who had looked upon them all who
expressed the opinion that this creation surpassed in beauty of setting and
harmony of outline anything hitherto achieved. From a vantage point of
view above the south viaduct over Sherman Avenue, looking west, immediately in the foreground one saw the Grand Court. in the center of which,
longitudinally, was set the canal or lagoon. This was the arena which the
architects chose for a display of the highest artistic effects. The canal was
is two thousand feet in length. one hundred and fifty feet in width at its east
end and through the major portion of its length, broadening at its west end
into a trefoil or three-lobed lake of four hundred feet across. The east end was known as the Harbor, whence passengers embarked in Venetian gondolas
of picturesque style of construction, propelled by typical gondoliers, who
perfected the transposition into fairyland by adding the music of their native
songs to the rhythm of their swaying bodies in the manipulation of the

propelling oars, The descent from the level of the Grand Court to that of the havens of the gondolas was by means of steps of masonry. The canal was spanned by an artistic bridge across its longitudinal center, forming an avenue of communication between the north and south sides of the Grand Court, with arches for the passage of the gondolas navigating the water beneath. Swans and other water fowls added to the picturesque beauty of this lagoon.</p>

<p>The west end of the lagoon was known as the "Mirror." In the center of the "Mirror" was an electric fountain designated "Nautilus." An unknown writer has described it as "Neptune sitting on high, viewing his realm with regal dignity. Before him riot his captive waters in holiday attire, assisted by the rainbow subjects of a rival sovereign. Innumerable sprays of vari-colored crystal fluid dart forth in rapid sequence, now bursting into flaming red, then quieting to subdued mother-of-pearl, and again offering a bouquet of myriad shades to the water-god."</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Government Building</p>
 
</div>

<p>Cutting off the horizon of vision to the west, the stately Government building stood, facing the "Mirror." It, like any of the Exposition, would, if set down by itself in almost any spot in the world, attract attention for its grandeur, stateliness and architectural beauty. It was constructed of the Ionic order of architecture, arranged in three sections, the center or main section having a frontage of two hundred and eight feet, flanked on either side by a side section with a frontage of one hundred and forty-eight feet, constituting an entire frontage of five hundred and four feet. The main section was fifty-eight feet in height to top of balustrade over cornice and fifty feet in depth. The side sections were one hundred feet deep and forty-four feet in height to top of balustrade. The main entrance was flanked on  either side by pavilions capped by richly decorated domes. The main building was surmounted by a colossal dome capped by an heroic figure representing "Liberty Enlightening the World," the torch of the figure being one hundred and seventy-eight feet above the ground. It was confessedly the finest exposition building the United States Government had ever constructed.</p>

<p>One of the happy features of the architecture of the Exposition now
presents itself, as our line of vision radiates eastward from the Government
building disclosing a system of vine-shaped columns treated in the Pompeian
manner connecting all the main buildings surrounding the Court of Honor,
providing visitors with a restful protection from the heat of the summer sun
as well as from the discomfort of rainy weather. These colonnades lead us
from the Government building in a graceful curve parallel to the lobes of

</div>

the "Mirror" on either side to the Palace of Agriculture on the north side
and to the Palace of Fine Arts on the south side of the Court.</p>

<p>The Palace of Agriculture was four hundred feet in length, one hundred
and forty-feet in width, and forty-eight feet in height. It was of the Renaissance or classic style of architecture, the decorations and ornaments, modeled from the agricultural products of the Trans-Mississippi territory, being festoons of corn and other cereals, and even the common market-garden products being given proper place in the decoration.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the Palace of Agriculture and also facing the lagoon
stood the Palace of Fine Arts, in shape a parallelogram, two hundred

forty feet in length, one hundred and twenty-five feet in width, and thirty-nine feet in height. Its architecture was unique in detail but in perfect harmony with the general lines of all the main buildings. It took the form of two separate, symmetrical, domed buildings,connected by a peristylium or open court surrounded by colonnades. The sculptor again crowned the pediments and flanking buttresses with groups and figures representing the various arts, and holding out for those who won them the emblems of success.</p>

<p>Next adjoining the Palace of Fine Arts on the east was the Arch of
States, already described. Directly opposite the Arch of States and on the
north side of the Court of Honor was the Administration Arch, connected
with the Palace of AGriculture on the west by a continuance of the Pompeian
Colonnade, which had its beginning at the Government building on either
side. The Administration Arch was fifty feet square and one hundred and
fifty feet in height. It formed a central figure in the group of buildings
facing the canal by reason of its height. Like all other buildings grouped
around the Grand Court, it was designed in "free classic," but the French Renaissance stood out more prominently in this building than any other. An open space between the roof and the main cornice formed a point of observation above the roofs of the other buildings.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Administration Arch on the east and connected with it
by a continuance of the Pompeian colonnade in graceful and restful curves
was the Palace of Manufactures. It was three hundred feet in length, one hundred and twenty-five feet in width and forty feet in height. The Greek
Ionic style of architecture characterized its lines. The order of heroic proportions was carried out with great artistic care in every detail. The principal feature of the canal facade was a circular dome one hundred and fifty feet in circumference, rising to a height of seventy-five feet, which was supported on a  circular row of Fluted Ionic columns, the space enclosed by them being open, forming a grand, open, domed vestibule for an approach to the building. The inner dome was richly designed with ribs and panels, and was highly decorated, while the outer was formed by a series of steps rising in the form of a cone to the apex, which was crowned by a richly decorated base for a
flagstaff. The outer row of dome columns was detached and the entablature
was broken around them at the base of the dome, while over each column was a statue and pedestal having as a background the stylobate of the dome.
This treatment was very monumental in effect, and while in good taste and
harmonious with the architectural style, it was, at the same time, like so much
of the genius displayed in the Exposition, original and interesting. Over
the doorway leading from the vestibule into the building were three large
panels between the pilasters to receive paintings emblematical of the character
of the exhibits displayed therein. Flanking the central dome were beautiful

Ionic colonnades which formed covered ways along the entire facade, terminating at the corner towers. Over these colonnades were balconies, capable of receiving large numbers of people, and opening from the interior galleries of the building, affording a fine point from which to obtain an elevated view of the canal and the beauties of the Grand Court.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the Palace of Manufactures and facing the south side
of the Grand Court was the Palace of Liberal Arts. This building was
two hundred and eighty feet in length, one hundred and twenty-five feet in
width and thirty-six feet four inches in height. Its design was of the French
Renaissance school of architecture, its harmony and proportion being regulated
by the other main exhibit buildings surrounding the Grand Court. Above
the pediments at each corner of the building were octagonal bases on which
stood groups of statuary, each group composed of four heroic figures, the

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>West End Colonnades</p>
 
</div>

main one representing the Liberal Arts supported by two kneeling figures
suggesting industrial art, while in front of all was a smaller figure supporting
a shield on which the attributes of pottery and wrought iron were inscribed.
The frieze all around the building was ornate, supported by colonnades of
Ionic type and contained the names of patrons of the Liberal Arts.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the Palace of Manufactures on the east and connected with
it by a continuation of the Pompeian colonnade was the Palace of Mines and
Mining. It was of the Greek Ionic style of architecture, four hundred feet
in length, one hundred and forty feet in width and forty-eight feet six inches
in height. The principal feature of the lagoon facade was a circular dome
one hundred and fifty feet in circumference, rising to a height of seventy-five
feet. The facade was accentuated at the center and on the ends with pavilions
sixty-four and forty feet respectively, thereby obtaining sufficient variety of
mass. The solidity of these pavilions and their strong perpendicular lines
and shadows gave a strong contrast of light and shade. The center entrance
was twenty-four feet wide and thirty-four feet high, very rich in decoration,

<p>ARCH OF THE STATES AND FINE ARTS BUILDING</p>

flanked on either side by coupled columns and their accompanying pilasters,
standing six feet from the walls. The main cornice broke around a projection
of columns supporting pedestals for groups of statuary twelve feet high.
The center of the pavilion was crowned by a colossal group of statuary.
Single statues were also placed between columns resting on stylobate, which
was projected out to receive them. The spandrels above the arch were
decorated with bas-reliefs. The end pavilions with their entrances were
crowned with shallow domes.</p>

<p>Directly across the Grand Court and facing the north side of the canal
was the Palace of Machinery and Electricity, connected with the Palace of
Manufactures by a section of the Pompeian colonnade. This palace was
three hundred feet in length, one hundred and forty feet in width and thirty-
one feet eight inches in height. The design was governed by the general
conditions requiring harmony with the other buildings. The architecture
was modern Renaissance. There were triple entrances on the main floor level
in the center of the main front, and similar groups in the centers of the east
and west fronts, with four emergency exits in the north wall. In front of
the building, flanking both sides of the main entrance. was an open portico
sixteen feet wide along the front elevation of the building. The center
entrance feature projected beyond the portico, thus forming the grand entrance
vestibule.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Palace of Machinery and Electricity on the east, and
situated in the northeast corner of the Kountze tract, was the Boys' and 
Girls' building, so called by reason of the cost of its construction having been paid from funds contributed by the school children of Trans-Mississippi
territory. It was not one of the main exhibit buildings, but was given a
place in the Grand Court as a worthy tribute to the sacrificing and enthusiastic loyalty of the children, on whose shoulders would rest in their generation the great responsibility of carrying on the development of science, industry and art, which this Exposition was to exhibit, as the result of the development of the two generations who had brought out of the "Great American Desert" what we were now to behold. The Boys' and Girls' building was of most
pleasing design, the ground plan being in the form of a letter T. the stem
of the letter forming the rear portion of the building. The main portion
of the building was one hundred feet in length and fifty feet in width, the
stem running fifty feet to the rear.</p>

<p>In the southeast corner of the Kountze tract and adjoining the Palace
of Mines and Mining on the east was the Auditorium or Music Hall. It
was one hundred and fifty feet in length, one hundred and fifteen feet in
width and thirty-seven feet in height. Architecturally. it was in keeping with
the general style of the buildings surrounding the Grand Court, but no attempt

at elaborate display of art or decoration was made, its purpose being to furnish
accommodation for concerts, congresses of various kinds, and other public
meetings. Its seating capacity was eleven hundred.</p>

<p>We have now, in our view from the vantage point above the south viaduct
over Sherman Avenue, taken immediately upon entering the Exposition
grounds, covered so much of the beautiful scene as came within the view to
the west, which could only include the Grand Court. Let us change our
view and look to the east. We have thus far feasted our vision upon a scene
incomparable in beauty and almost beyond adequate description, but as we
turn and bring within the horizon of our vision the scene toward the east,
though we lose sight of the splendor of the Grand Court, we gaze upon
another rare scene entirely different in every detail but hardly less difficult
of description. We now look upon the so-called Bluff tract as the foreground, and beyond the picturesque valley of the mighty Missouri River, reaching to the horizon to the north and to the south, and beyond the river the bluffs of the State of Iowa, where the councils with the tribes of Indians who possessed the territory fifty years ago were held. Our view at the present time, however, must be confined to the transformation wrought within the boundaries of the Bluff tract.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this history it will be recorded that the transformation of
the Bluff tract from its original landscape of corn stubble to the grand and
beauteous scene which we now behold, began in November, 1897, less than
seven months ago, for we are now gazing upon the scene of the opening day
of the Exposition, June 1, 1898. While there was no special publicity given
to the thought at the time, there was no feature of the Exposition speaking
so eloquently for the fertility of the soil, the energy and genius of its people
and the possibilities of the future of the Trans-Mississippi empire, as did the
transformation of this Bluff tract of Missouri River silt from a field of corn
stubble to this perspective of grand avenues, shaded by stately trees and
surrounded by beautiful shrubs and flowers, in such a brief period of time. The skeptical visitor from the East who, perhaps, had spent a lifetime in effort to accomplish something approaching this in beauty and effect around his home mansion on the edge of his estate, in the stony soil of his native State, could hardly realize what had been done here, and many of his kind do not believe it to be the truth even to this day. The rugged bluff and monotonous vista of level soil had disappeared under the artistic touches of the landscape gardener, and had been succeeded by long, cool stretches of turf, miles of neatly graveled walks and drives and a wilderness of trees and shrubs I and flowers suggestive of tropical luxury. The most of this, in fact, had been accomplished since the last snow had melted and trickled down the bluff to swell the turbid current of the river below, for little could be done during the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.052.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.052.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.052.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

months of the winter. The trees were as luxuriant and the turfs and flowers
as inviting as though years had been spent in their cultivation, and the visitor wondered whether most to admire the setting or the gem. It required three thousand trees and nine thousand shrubs to carry out this feature, and these were chiefly varieties native to Nebraska. Twelve hundred shade trees were planted along the walks and drives. The stretches of green turf were broken by miles of gravel walks laid out in artistic pattern around the buildings and

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>East End Terrace</p>
 
</div>

grass plots. The aggregate length of these walks was fifteen thousand two
hundred and four linear feet exclusive of the Grand Plaza, which had an area
of eight thousand four hundred and eighty-four square yards. An irrigation
system of above twelve thousand linear feet of pipe was necessary to supply
the moisture needed to create and maintain this picture through the torrid
months of the summer. Over one hundred thousand plants and flowers, in
addition to a vast number of vines for decorative effects, were necessary to
perfect the scheme. These were matured in the green-houses constructed for
the purpose upon the grounds during the previous winter. Upwards of sixty
beds of various patterns filled with a score of different varieties of lilies,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.053.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.053.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.053.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

geraniums, oleanders, dahlias, cannas and arbutus, were laid out in the grass
plots in the southerly half of the tract.</p>

<p>Inspired by the metamorphosis wrought in the Bluff tract, ex-Senator
Ingalls said: "Of all those vast movements of the human race in its westward
path across the continents and seas, from the Tigris and Euphrates, around
the globe, none have surpassed in dramatic circumstances and immensity of
results, that tremendous migration, which, in less than the lifetime of a single generation, has transformed the dominion of the desert into the garden ground and granary of the earth. These peaceful hosts, armed with the alphabet and the plow, have conquered a domain whose extent makes the conquests of
Caesar and Napoleon insignificant. Overcoming the obstacles of nature with
irresistible energy they have added to the productive area of the republic a
territory greater than France and Germany combined, and to its wealth and
resources an aggregate that arithmetic can not compute. To celebrate these

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Viaduct Towers.</p>
 
</div>

triumphs, to commemorate an historic epoch, and to inspire mankind with
continued devotion to the ideas that have made such annals possible, was
organized the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. History
records the wonders of Egypt, its temples and palaces, its statues, pyramids
and cities, its wealth and learning and glory, surviving the wrecks of thirty
centuries. These were the result of the labors of a few million slaves, with
rude implements, upon the narrow margin of fertility along the Nile and its
delta, not exceeding in area one-tenth part of the State of Nebraska. The
imagination is baffled in contemplating the future of that region, whose genesis
is told by the Omaha Exposition, when the toil of intelligent freemen supplemented by machinery and new discoveries and inventions shall have completely developed its unmeasured resources."</p>

<p>The most noticeable feature in this beautiful panorama was the Palace
of Horticulture, which occupied a position about in the center of that portion
of the Bluff tract south of our view-point. It was three hundred feet in length,
seventy feet in width and twenty-nine feet in height. Rising above the center

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.054.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.054.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.054.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

was a beautiful dome covered with glass, one hundred and ten feet in height.
Above the dome was an open observatory balcony from which a grand view
of the cities of Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs could be obtained.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of the landscape was the aquatic
basin in front of the Palace of Horticulture, which was filled with an extensive and valuable collection of pond lilies, with some magnificent specimens of the Victoria Regina.</p>

<p>Immediately south of and opposite the center of the Palace of Horticulture was a unique cottage office building, small in size but filling out a wide diversity of modern methods to render business transactions convenient and comfortable.</p>

<p>North of the Palace of Horticulture and occupying the four corners of
the quadrangle between it and the Grand Plaza were the State buildings of
Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois. All of these buildings were most
creditable contributions of their respective States to the architecture of the
Exposition. Naturally, Nebraska was the largest and most costly of the
group. It was distinctive in character, classic in architecture, and was one
hundred and forty-five feet in length, ninety feet in width, with a central
dome sixty feet in diameter, rising to a height of eighty-five feet, as its most conspicuous feature. The Iowa building was a showy as well as tasty edifice, it with wide portico, and presented in its architecture an inviting and hospitable appearance. Wisconsin and Illinois exhibited the hospitable good-will which characterizes the West, and applied for and received full recognition, responding in the full spirit of the Trans-Mississippi States. Appropriately grouped along the easterly and westerly sides of the Bluff tract, on either side of the quadrangle south of the Grand Plaza already described, were the State buildings of New York, Georgia, Minnesota, Kansas and Montana. Also the Pottawattamie County building, the headquarters of Council Bluffs, the
Nebraska sod house, a building erected entirely of sod brought in from the
prairies of Nebraska and typical of the early history of the original settlers
of the Trans-Mississippi territory, the Chinese building and the exhibit
buildings of the Omaha Bemis Bag Company, Montgomery Ward and Company and the Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company.</p>

<p>This brings us from the south end of the Bluff tract up to the Grand
Plaza, which was immediately east of the southerly or main viaduct over
and across Sherman Avenue. It was in effect an out-door auditorium with
seating capacity to the limit of its area, on the extreme east of which was a
large stage or platform backed by a high sounding-board. Here were given
each afternoon and evening during the Exposition, weather permitting,
concerts by the largest and best musical organizations in the country, such as
Theodore Thomas' Orchestra, The United States Marine Band, The Mexican

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.055.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.055.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.055.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

National Band, and others of equal merit and popularity. The management
of the Exposition gave to the daily musical programs a prominent place, which
resulted in bringing visitors to the Exposition together twice each day, to
mingle not only with one another, but to come in touch with the people of
Omaha who had borne the burden of the creation of the Exposition, and the
friendships thus formed on the Grand Plaza during the Exposition have in
thousands of cases grown and cemented themselves to the lasting benefit of
individuals as well as that of the States.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>East End of Grand Court</p>
 
</div>

<p>Changing our point of view to the north, we look upon a scene as different
in character from that which has just engaged us, as the latter differed from
the splendor of the Grand Court. We are now in position to appreciate the
wisdom of the management in the distribution of space to the various features
of entertainment and amusement. We are also able to comprehend the maximum of exhibits and entertainment provided in a minimum of space, thus placing the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition far in the lead of all Expositions in respect to arrangement of its grounds as to make for the visitor a restful rather than a tiresome excursion, enabling him to enjoy

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.056.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.056.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.056.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

every feature. We have already found the Grand Court with its canal and
main exhibit buildings so arranged as to provide a maximum of study and
pleasure, with a minimum of weariness. So with the landscaping effects
and beauty of the southerly major portion of the Bluff tract. Turning now
to the north we view the playground of all nations, with the accompanying
pandemonium. Immediately in the foreground was the so-called East Midway stretching to the northerly limits of the Bluff tract, thence turning to the west into the West Midway, which occupied the southerly portion of the

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>East End Grand Court at Night</p>
 
</div>

so-called North tract. First of all, immediately below our point of view at the
east end of the Grand Court, are the two great Restaurant buildings, one on
either side of the viaduct and on the east line of Sherman Avenue. These
were models of architecture, two stories in height, with roof gardens, where
the multitudes could always find an abundance of the best of food to meet the
necessities of every class, from the highest appointed banquet to the simple
luncheon of a roll and coffee. Here was served the luncheon and dinner to
the President of the United States, his cabinet, staff and the diplomatic corps.
served with all the appropriate appointments, and here also the most humble

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.057.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.057.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.057.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

could be served with simple taste. Adjoining the Restaurant on the north
was the Moorish Village housed in a palace, affording a specimen of fine
Moorish architecture with Oriental dome and towering minarets, which
attracted attention from every point of view within the range of vision, just
beyond was the Streets of Cairo, where the visitor dropped into the midst of an
Egypt as realistic as anything to be experienced after sailing the length of the
Mediterranean. The babel of tongues and the almost human appeal of the
camel to mount his back for a ride in the imaginary desert of his native land
gave a clear perception of the real Egypt. Opposite these on the East Midway
were the Japanese Tea Garden and German Village, the Old English Fair,
the Baby Incubator, the Mammoth Whale, and various concessions ministering
to the hungry and thirsty, but it should be stated here that no spirituous liquors
were sold within the gates, nor was any place of amusement allowed to present
any feature which could be criticized for a lack of moral tone. The closest
scrutiny was exercised over the moral atmosphere of every feature of the
Exposition by those highest in authority, as well as those who were charged
with carrying out the detail.</p>

<p>From a position over the North Viaduct across Sherman Avenue, looking west over the West Midway, we find in the foreground on the right the Giant See-Saw, an immense stack of machinery constructed on the same principle as the plaything of childhood, but with a capacity of taking a crowd of people into the comfortable little houses on either end and lifting them two hundred feet from the ground, from which point a bird's-eye view of the three cities and the surrounding country could be had. Immediately to the left was
the "Shoot the Chutes" sporting ground, which every visitor felt impelled to
try at least once, and many enjoyed frequent trips. Next came the Scenic
Railway, with its plunges through tunnels, over mountains and down into
valleys, always returning to the starting point without any apparent motive
power. Beyond was the Wild West Show, the Old Plantation, the Cyclorama
of the battle between the Monitor and Merrimac, the Streets of All Nations,
with the only "Ah Khoun" in charge. Hagenbach's Wild Animals, Glass
Blowers, The Fall of Babylon, with countless other concessions of greater or
less degree, capable of furnishing amusement to the taste of every visitor,
regardless of whence he came or whither he was traveling.</p>

<p>Some distance to the northwest was the largest of the Exposition buildings, that of Transportation and Agricultural Implements. Being contiguous to the main line of the Missouri Pacific Railway, it was convenient to the system of railway tracks necessary to provide for placing the exhibits upon the ground. This building was four hundred and thirty feet in length and three hundred feet in width, thus covering above three acres of ground. Its

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.058.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.058.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.058.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

characteristic architecture was half timber, half plaster, with its whole surface marked off into panels by an interesting network of framing timbers, posts. brackets and braces. Still beyond the Transportation building to the northwest was the Live Stock exhibit, which equaled any ever given, both as to
variety, quality and quantity, as well as to the number of high premiums awarded to the value of the same. South of the Live Stock exhibit and
west of the Transportation building was the Encampment of Indians, the most
unique in history, as for many reasons it had never before been attempted,

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Fine Arts Building at Night</p>
 
</div>

and for equally as many reasons can never be reproduced. It receives special
consideration in another chapter.</p>

<p>We have, in a cursory way, covered the area of the Exposition grounds,
and the day being far spent we will retrace our steps. Arriving at our former
position over the South Viaduct at the east end of the Grand Court, we can not
refrain from pausing again to feast our eyes on the beauteous landscape to
the south, grown even richer in its varied hues. And turning again to the
West the Grand Court seems to have taken on more grandeur since we left it.
We are full of praise beyond utterance and prepare still further to retrace

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.059.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.059.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.059.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

our way to the entrance gate, when the Government building suddenly
becomes outlined against the darkening sky with lines of light, as does the
Palace Of Fine Arts and the Palace of Agriculture, the Administration Arch
and Arch of States, Liberal Arts and Manufactures, Mines and Mining,
Electricity, the Auditorium, the Colonnades, the Restaurants, the Canal, the
Fountain "Nautilus," the Palace of Horticulture, the State buildings, the
Bluff tract, the Midway with all its multitudinous attractions. Suddenly a
dazzling finger of light carries the eye back to the starting point. There the
ray of a powerful searchlight is seen shooting from the torch in the hand of
the heroic statue of "Liberty Enlightening the World," which surmounts
the Government building, and the picture of fairyland is made complete.</p>

<p>HISTORIC EVENTS OF THE EXPOSITION SEASON</p>

<p>CHAPTER III</p>

<p>THE Exposition of 1898 marked a new epoch in the life of the Trans-Mississippi States. Of itself it was an extraordinary event in the progress of the West. Moreover. it was made the fitting occasion of numerous lesser events, which served to magnify and round out the Exposition, winning for it a permanent place in the annals of the prairie States, whose complete history can never be written without a chronicle of the achievements of the West as
illustrated at Omaha in 1898. Other chapters of this work are devoted to descriptions of many extraordinary features of the great enterprise. This chapter is a review of a number of the more important events incident to the special days which were set apart as marking celebrations of extraordinary character. Arbor Day was one of these, and while it was celebrated more than a year prior to the opening of the gates, it was chosen as a fitting day for the ceremonies incident to the laying of the corner-stone of the Arch of the States-April 22, 1897. This was the first ceremonial of the Exposition.</p>

<p>Arbor Day in Nebraska means more to its citizens than to those of other
States, by reason of the fact that the late Sterling Morton, its founder,
was one of her foremost citizens. His memory is cherished because of the
great service he rendered to his State and country. Arbor Day in 1897
marked the sixty-fifth anniversary birth. His motto—"Plant Trees"—
has been heeded universally.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion the weather was propitious—warm and clear, following a rain the previous night. The elements seem to have conspired to make
the event memorable. Nature's generous contribution to the success of the
ceremonies was regarded as a favorable omen.</p>

Deputy Grand Master J. B. Dinsmore. Grand Secretary W. R. Bowen, Grand
Treasurer Christian Hartman, Grand Senior Warden F. H. Young, and
Acting Grand junior Warden George W. Lininger. The wine and oil used
for the ceremony were brought from Jerusalem by Past Grand Master George

<p>At the conclusion of the ceremonies the Grand Master delivered the
implement of the profession of builders to Architect-in-Chief Thomas R.
Kimball exhorting him to supervise well the construction of the buildings,
and then announced that the corner-stone had been well laid and all in due
form.</p>

<p>The President of the Exposition, Gurdon W. Wattles, then formally
introduced the various speakers of the day. Addresses were delivered by
Hon. William J. Broatch, Acting Mayor of the City of Omaha, Lieutenant-Governor Harris of Nebraska, and the Hon. Sterling Morton, of Nebraska City, Nebraska, ex-Secretary of Agriculture of the United States.</p>

<p>OPENING DAY—June 1, 1898</p>

<p>Next in importance among the historic events of the Exposition may
properly be noted the Opening Day. The great work of construction had
been completed, and true to the sterling principles of business, characterizing
the truly great men who formed the Executive Committee which carried the
burdens of the great enterprise, and almost unprecedented in the history of
previous great expositions, the gates were thrown open to the public on the

appointed day and at the appointed hour. Seeming impossibilities had been
overcome and all obstacles swept away.</p>

<p>In anticipation of this great day the principal officials and many prominent
citizens of the nation were formally invited to attend. The invitation was as
follows:</p>

<p>FORMAL INVITATION</p>

<p>Although commemorating no single event in the history of the region lying west of the
Mississippi River, the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition has been projected as a demonstration of the marvelous resources of the Great West. In grateful recognition of that spirit of progress, which, in the brief period of half a century, has transformed a wilderness into twenty-four States and Territories, embracing more than two-thirds the area, nearly one-fourth of the wealth and one-third of the population of our country the whole world has been invited to participate with us in a display of the arts, industries, manufacturers and products of the soil, mine and sea.</p>

<p>The attention of civilization has been called to this display, not merely in the spirit of emulation, but in gratitude to those intrepid pioneers who bravely faced dangers and overcame obstacles that the course of Empire might not be impeded in the westward march.
It is a memorial to the indomitable courage and perseverance of that sturdy vanguard, no less than as an illustration of the achievements of their successors, that the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition will open its gates from June 1st until November 1st, 1898. In the name of the entire West. I most cordially invite your cooperation and the honor of your presence. With profound respect, I am,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>GURDON W. WATTLES,</p>

<p>(SEAL) <em class="hi">President</em>.</p>

<p>Special invitations were sent to many to attend the opening exercises.
The day dawned bright and clear, and the beautiful sunshine and balmy air
were regarded as good omens of future success. This was the day to which
the officials of the Exposition had looked forward with hope and courage for
many weary months, and now as they gazed at the gathering throngs and the c
magnificent buildings, practically complete, fully realizing the magnitude of
their undertaking and the sacrifices this day with all its triumphs had entailed,
a feeling of thankfulness and satisfaction came to them all. With glad hearts
and smiling faces the officials entered upon the duties of the day, strong in the
belief that financial success must follow the artistic success now so clearly in
evidence.</p>

<p>The opening ceremonies were planned to occur at twelve o'clock, noon,
when the President of the United States would set the machinery in motion W
by electric current transmitted from the executive mansion in Washington,
and formally declare the Exposition open to the world. At 10:30 a. m. a
line of parade was formed in the city, the right of the column resting on
Sixteenth and Douglas Streets, and moved to the Exposition grounds in the

<p>Senator William V. Allen of Nebraska was to have made an address
on this great day, but he was unable to be present, for reasons given in the
following letter, which was read by Hon. Gilbert M. Hitchcock during the
exercises:</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D. C., May 28, 1898.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Hon. Gurdon W. Wattles, President Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, Omaha.</em></p>

<p>DEAR SIR: It has become apparent that it will be impossible for me to be present at
the opening of the Exposition. I regret this extremely, as it has been my desire to be
present, if possible, on that occasion. Having had intimate connection with the promotion of the enterprise from its inception, I have taken a deep interest in its success, believing that it will furnish our people a desirable and peculiar means of education, and that it will be highly valuable in attracting attention to Nebraska in a way that could not be done otherwise. I do not doubt the Exposition will be successful, and that hundreds of thousands of people will by it be attracted to Omaha and the State at large, who would otherwise know

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.069.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.069.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.069.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

little of the State and city, and that everyone who may visit Nebraska during the Exposition will be amply well satisfied. With our great natural resources, beautiful summer scenery, and the health-giving qualities of our climate, Nebraska, could not otherwise than prove attractive to visitors, apart from what may be seen at the Exposition. Our possibilities as a State are almost boundless, and at present inconceivable. The Nebraska of fifty years from now will present one of the greatest and richest agricultural communities of the world.</p>

<p>But, much as I would like to be with you, and much as I have desired and intended, if
possible to be, I feel that I could not excuse myself for leaving my post of duty at this time, when Congress is engaged in discussing ways and means of raising money with which to successfully prosecute the present war against Spain. We are altogether too long derelict

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Marine Band—Grand Plaza</p>
 
</div>

in our duty to Cuba. Within less than one hundred miles from our shores, the extermination of one million five hundred thousand people by starvation, of old men, boys, women and children, including sucklings, went on unchecked until one-third of the population of Cuba have died by that means. We could no longer justify ourselves in the eyes of the Christian and civilized world by declining to take immediate cognizance of the conditions there prevailing and live up to our high professions of humanity by intervening in the war between Spain and her Cuban subjects. We, of all nations of the western hemisphere, have the power to say to Spain that she shall not depopulate Cuba by starvation for aspiring to gain the liberty we ourselves enjoy and hold to be the rightful heritage of all.</p>

<p>From the start I have advocated Cuban liberty, even at a time when it was not popular in the Senate to do so, and having been a pioneer in the cause, I could not feel that my duty was discharged unless I remained at my desk in the Senate until the ways and means
of raising the necessary money to prosecute the war successfully have been fully determined.</p>

<p>I trust that I may be permitted to spend a portion of my summer vacation at the Exposition, and contribute my full share to its success; and if at any time it all be deemed desirable by the management for me to deliver an address I will gladly do so. I trust that you will me the honor of announcing, during the exercises, the fact that I am detained by my duties at Washington.</p>

<p>Expressing the hope and the full confidence that the Exposition will be preeminently successful, and that ere the summer is gone the War With Spain will have been successfully terminated, and Cuba, Porto Rico and Philippines male free, and Spain forever driven from her last foothold in territory on this continent, I am, very respectfully,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>WILLIAM V. ALLEN.</p>

<p>(The invocation and addresses on the occasion will be found in their  proper place in Part II.)</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the addresses, a direct wire from the executive mansion in Washington to the platform on which these exercises were held having been secured, Manager W. W. Umsted, of the local office of the Western Union Telegraph Company, took the following message from the President of the United States, which was read by Governor Silas A. Holcomb of Nebraska:</p>

<p>The cordiality of the invitation extended to me to be present at the opening of your great Exposition is deeply appreciated, and I more deeply regret that public duties prevent me from leaving the Capital at this time.</p>

<p>The events of the memorable half century, which the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition commemorates, are interwoven with the history of the nation, and are of surpassing importance. The mighty West affords most striking evidences of the splendid achievements and possibilities of our people. It is a matchless tribute to the energy. and endurance of the pioneer, while its vast agricultural development, its progress in manufactures, its advancement in the arts and sciences and in all departments of education and endeavor have been inestimable contributions to the civilization and wealth of the world.</p>

<p>Nowhere have the unconquerable determination, self-reliant strength and sturdy man-hood of our American citizenship been more forcibly illustrated. In peace or War the men and women of the West have ever been in the vanguard. I congratulate the management upon its magnificent enterprise and assure all who participate in this undertaking, of the deep interest which the Government has in its success.</p>

<p>WILLIAM MCKINLEY.</p>

<p>The following excerpt from dispatches from Washington pictures the scene at the White House at this hour of the official opening:</p>

<p>Conditions were well nigh perfect when at 1:30 o'clock today, Washington time, corresponding to 12:30 o'clock, Omaha time, President McKinley pushed the button, formally opening the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. Around the Chief Executive were grouped many of the foremost men in public life: men who have been molding public opinion for a quarter of century. It was an inspiring scene; this culmination of many anxious moments of personal sacrifice it the part of those who have given time and money to so gigantic an undertaking that out of it might come a better appreciation of the forces dominating that vast territory which extends from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, from the frigid North to the Gulf of Mexico. In his short term in the presidential chair,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.072.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.072.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.072.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Major McKinley has shown patriotic devotion to the whole country, and, wherever possible in his active, busy life, has lent his presence and his help to enterprises of both local and national character.</p>

<p>In order to conform to the arrangements, the hour of formally recognizing the Trans-
Mississippi and International Exposition as open was deferred until 1:30 o'clock, at which time there were assembled in President McKinley's reception room the following distinguished party: Senators Allen and Thurston, Representatives Mercer, Stark, Sutherland, Maxwell and Greene, Mrs. Sutherland and daughter, Mrs. Greene and daughters, Mr. Bert Wheeler, all of Nebraska; Representative Fleming of Georgia, Representative Johns of North Dakota, and Senator William B. Allison of Iowa.</p>

<p>Considerable delay was experienced by Captain Montgomery in getting a wire west of Chicago direct to the Exposition grounds, but finally the welcome sound "Omaha" came to the alert telegrapher, and there were Hashed these words by Montgomery:</p>

<p>"This is the White House, Washington. When this key closes, the President will close it."</p>

<p>"Everything is ready, Mr. President," said Captain Montgomery, and the Chief Executive, gracious in manner, stepped to the key of the instrument, and, depressing it with his right hand, closed the circuit. Those in the room stood during this ceremony, a ceremony perhaps of little interest in general, yet of paramount interest to those gathered in the cool reception room. At 1:53 o'clock, Washington time, the President announced that his part of the ceremony was done and that the Exposition was formally opened.</p>

<p>There was clapping of hands. Congratulations and thanks were extended to the President for his patience and affability, and for taking so much time from the affairs of the nation in order to give the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition the benefit of his benediction and good wishes. Immediately after the pressure upon the button, the President's message of congratulation was sent, which was followed by congratulatory telegrams transmitted by members of the Nebraska delegation, terminating a most auspicious event. </p>

<p>After the congratulatory dispatch of the President had been sent, Executive Clerk Montgomery sent the following telegram to President Wattles:</p>

<p>"The members of the Nebraska delegation, assembled in the Executive Mansion, beg leave to extend their congratulations upon the auspicious beginning of so vast an enterprise as the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, and regret their inability to be present and personally to participate in its accomplishment."</p>

<p>Thus was concluded the formal exercises of Opening Day. Following
these exercises the official guests were entertained at luncheon at the Markel
Café.</p>

<p>At four o'clock an official public reception was held in the United States
Government building at the west end of the main porch. At eight o'clock
p. m. a concert was given in the Auditorium by the Theodore Thomas
Orchestra, assisted by the Exposition chorus. At nine o'clock p. m. a grand

illumination of fireworks was given in the North tract, east of the Transportation and Agricultural Implement building, and thus the first day of the Exposition passed into history.</p>

<p>The total admissions on Opening Day were 27,998.</p>

<p>NEBRASKA DAY—June 14, 1898</p>

<p>This was the day selected by the Nebraska State Commission for the formal dedication of the Nebraska building.

date for the beautiful building which she had cased to be
erected side by side with Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois.</p>

<p>ILLINOIS DAY—June 21, 1898</p>

<p>Illinois was another of the States east of the Mississippi River which
entered into the spirit of the Exposition with all the enthusiasm of the Trans-
Mississippi States; in fact, next to Nebraska, appropriated the largest sum
for participation in the Exposition. Her building attracted much attention,
and was one of the favorites in the group of State buildings. An annex to
the building was erected and maintained as an art gallery for the Columbian
Exposition pictures painted by John R. Key.</p>

<p>The celebration in connection with the dedication of the Illinois building
became an historic one, as will appear in the narrative. Nebraska had become
the home of a multitude of sterling men from Illinois, and Omaha boasted p
of more than her proportion, which created a strong family feeling between
the two States. A number of the men officially connected with the Exposition
were formerly more or less identified with Illinois. Secretary John A. Wakefield, Manager Freeman P. Kirkendall of the Department of Building and
Grounds, Vice-President Alvin Saunders, Manager William N. Babcock of
the Department of Transportation, and Directors Euclid Martin and Lucius
Wells, all hailed from Illinois in the early days of their business careers.</p>

<p>Some time previous to the time announced for the commencement of
the exercises the people gravitated toward the Illinois building, and its wide
porches, rotunda and parlors were soon crowded. As fast as they came they
were supplied with badges of white ribbons on which was printed "Illinois
Day, June 21, 1898, Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, Omaha,
Neb." Many of the people who came from Illinois to take up their home in
Nebraska and neighboring States took advantage of the opportunity to renew
old acquaintances with the visitors, and an hour was spent very pleasantly in
social intercourse. The members of the Illinois Commission who had come
early to the grounds, the visiting delegations from the Chicago commercial
organizations and large numbers of people from all sections of Illinois had
gathered at the building when the hour arrived for the exercises to begin.
The entire party passed in a body to the Auditorium, and on arrival there
found the large building well filled. The interior was hung with bunting,
which lent an air of gayety to the scene and improved the acoustics of the
building. Palms and other foliage plants gave the stage a pleasing appearance.
The Apollo Musical Club of Chicago occupied seats at the back of the
platform.</p>

<p>At 11:30 a. m. the official party made its appearance at the north door
and marched down the main aisle to the stage, preceded by the official flag
Illinois, borne by J. Mack Tanner, Private Secretary to the Governor. Governor and Mrs. Tanner led the way, followed by Governor Holcomb of

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.077.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.077.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.077.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Nebraska; President Clark E. Carr, of the Illinois Commission; Chairman
W. H. Harper, of the Executive Committee; the speakers of the day, members of the Illinois Commission with their wives, delegates from the Union Age Club of Chicago, the Stock Exchange, Board of Trade, Nation Business League, Chicago World's Fair Directory, members of the Nebraska Commission, members of the Executive Committee of the Exposition, members of the Bureau of Entertainment, and the official staffs of Governor Tanner and of Governor Holcomb, all in full uniform. The staffs of the Governors and the Trans-Mississippi Troopers were seated in the center of the house, immediately in front of the platform.</p>

<p>The program of exercises for the day was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music—"The Stars and Stripes Forever"</span>
<span class="l">Prayer—Chancellor McLean, University of Nebraska.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Hon. W. H. Harpers, Chairman Illinois Executive Committee.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Col. Clark E. Carr, President Illinois Commission.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Governor John R. Tanner, Illinois.</span>
<span class="l">Music—Apollo Club.</span>
<span class="l">Address—President Gurdon W. Wattles.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Governor Silas A. Holcomb, Nebraska.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Ex-Governor Joseph L. Beveridge, Illinois.</span></span>

<p>When all were seated the Marine Band made its way to the stage amid a
burst of applause. At twelve o'clock the band formally opened the exercises
with Sousa's stirring march.</p>

<p>(The addresses made on this occasion will be founded in their appropriate place in Part II.)</p>

<p>Following the address of Governor Tanner, which was full of patriotic
sentences, with appropriate allusions to the war with Spain, then being carried
on, ensued one of the most dramatic scenes ever witnessed at an Exposition.
Colonel Carr introduced Hon. Melville E. Stone, Manager of the Associated Press, who had received and read to the audience a bulletin he had just received announcing that General Shafter, with his army, had arrived off Santiago in safety. The crowd went wild with enthusiasm in an instant. Men and women jumped to their feet and wild cheers rent the air, while the flutter of dainty white handkerchiefs and the waving of hats, canes and umbrellas filled the air. While the cheering was at its height the stirring strains of "The Star Spangled Banner" rose above the glad shouts, ad the enthusiasm of the audience knew no bounds. Men and women mounted the seats and waved their arms in the air as though carried away, and the music was almost drowned beneath the flood of glad acclaims. The Audience soon joined in the music.,however, and the shouting gave place to singing as the whole audience joined in the stirring war-song.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.078.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.078.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.078.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The enthusiasm did not wane with the cessation of the song. The Apollo
Club sang "Illinois," and as soon as this was concluded, without pause, the
Club sang "America," the audience rising to join in the song, and again the
big building rang with a volume of sound which threatened to burst the walls.</p>

<p>When the enthusiasm had slightly subsided, Colonel Carr announced
that as the Marine Band was compelled to leave for Washington on the afternoon train, it would be asked to play at this point, instead of later in the exercises, as was originally intended.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Government Building At Night</p>
 
</div>

<p>The "Voice of Our Nation," an arrangement of national and patriotic
airs and folk songs by Director Santelman, was selected by the leader, and as
the familiar strains rose upon the air the audience was again electrified.
People jumped to their feet and cheered madly as "Yankee Doodle," "Star
Spangled Banner," "Dixie' "The Knight's Farewell," and other popular airs
were played in quick succession. Such enthusiasm is rarely witnessed in any
assembly, and the applause which followed the conclusion of the selection was
continued unabated as the band played "Auld Lang Syne" for an encore and
then withdrew.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.079.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.079.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.079.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The program was then taken up where it had been interrupted, and
President Wattles' address followed.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, on the memorable fourth day of July, the program of
the day was interrupted in the same manner as is above chronicled by a
bulletin from the front of General Shafter's army, announcing that terms of
unconditional surrender of the Spanish army to General Shafter's forces had
been submitted as an ultimatum. The scenes of tumultuous enthusiasm were
repeated, forming a striking partnership between War. The Exposition and
Peace. During the memorable Jubilee Week of the Exposition three months later, President McKinley, General Miles and General Shatter stood before
the enthusiastic multitudes of visitors at the Exposition and told the story
of the victories in the war with Spain, as they had personally had to do with
their accomplishment.</p>

<p>KANSAS DAY—June 22, 1898</p>

<p>The dedication of the Kansas building was the event of Kansas Day.
Situated on the southerly portion of the Bluff tract, it was the center of attraction and was crowded with visitors of the Sunflower State when the party of State officials and members of the Kansas Exposition Commission reached the building at eleven o'clock a.m. The interior of the building was handsomely
decorated with bunting, potted plants and cut flowers. The program was
as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Trumpet Call—Trumpet Corps. Boys' First Regiment of Topeka.</span>
<span class="l">Music—"The Flag Without a Stain" .............................. Male Quartette, Topeka </span>
<span class="l">Address of Welcome—Vice-President J. E. Frost, of the Kansas Commission.</span>
<span class="l">Response—President Gurdon W. Wattles.
Song—"Nature's Adoration" ..................................... James W. Moore, Topeka</span>
<span class="l">Address—Hon. Silas Porter. Wyandotte.</span>
<span class="l">Song— Quartette.</span>
<span class="l">Taps—Boys' Trumpet Corps.</span></span>

<p>It was a great day for Kansas, in that it brought that State and its great
men as well as its cosmopolitan population into close touch with each other
and with her sister State, Nebraska, and the multitudes of people from every
State and land under auspices unparalleled in the experience of most of them
in connection with the wonderful sights of the Exposition. After the exercises
of the day were completed, the remainder of the day was spent in an attempt
to take in all the wonders of the great show.</p>

<p>IOWA DEDICATION DAY—June 23, 1898</p>

<p>The interests of the States of Iowa and Nebraska are so interwoven by
the two great cities Council Bluffs and Omaha, united by the bridges spanning
the Missouri River, which only technically divides the two States and the two
cities, that Iowa Day became a united Iowa and Nebraska Day at the Exposition. The weather was the typical corn weather which makes the face of
each citizen of the two States, in annual competition with each other for third
place in the list of corn-producers of the world, gleam with satisfaction. "It
is mighty good corn weather," was the salutation between the celebrants of
this day, much as "How" is the universal salutation between the American 
Indians when they meet. While the Iowa and Nebraska farmers were sweltering in the effulgence of the sun on Iowa Day, they knew that their corn was
growing so fast that their hired men could hardly sleep nights from the noise
of the cracking soil in which the roots were working double time, sending
the sap up the stalks to feed the great ears forming in their fibre. The
merchants and professional men were equally contented in contemplation of
what the big crop means to the corn States. So Iowa Day was a big day.</p>

<p>The Iowa building, somewhat after the refreshing style of the French
chateau, was one of the finest on the Exposition grounds. It was situated
directly west of the Nebraska building on the Bluff tract, in the center of the
group of State buildings, fronting east and overlooking the beautiful valley
of the Missouri River and the bluffs on the Iowa side of the river, back of its
own city of Council Bluffs. The peculiarity of the building was its great semi-circular veranda in front, concave in form, extending outward as if to embrace,
and each of the two arms terminating in a large pagoda, a unique but comfortable arrangement, because airy and convenient, affording every facility 
for music and public-speaking. The building proper was two stories in height.
A feature of the interior was the fine tapestry paintings representing Iowa
rural scenes of various stages of farming. Another feature was the huge
organ built by Paul E. Cerruti, of Mason City, who, when a boy in his teens. 
played the organ of the celebrated cathedral in Milan, Italy.</p>

<p>As the day advanced the crowd increased, and by the time the exercises
were to commence the building was filled to overflowing, not an inch of
standing-room remaining, except such as had been reserved for the speaker
and the guests of honor for the occasion. The main room and rotunda were
especially attractive. Foliage, plants and cut flowers were on every side.</p>

<p>At two o'clock Governor Leslie M. Shaw, escorted by the members of the
Iowa Exposition Commission, entered the grounds. They were met by the
Atlantic City Band and escorted to the building, the exercises commencing
without delay. The speakers and distinguished guests occupied seats on the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.082.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.082.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.082.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

wide veranda in front of the center of the building, and back of them were
grouped the Dubuque Choral Club. Seated on the platform were the speakers.
of the day, Governor Holcomb, of Nebraska; Adjutant-General Barry, Ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, Colonel Brownlow, of the Post Office Department;
Capt. W. W. Cox, Secretary of the Government Board of Control; members of
the Exposition Committee and several members of the Iowa Commission. Fully
three thousand people were assembled in honor of the occasion, and the fluttering of the gay ribbons of the feminine portion of the audience, the many
flags hung from cornice and pinnacle, together with the profusion of cut
flowers, lent an air of gayety and festivity to the scene which made a beautiful
sight. The program of exercises was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music—Overture ................... .................................... Atlantic City Band</span>
<span class="l">Invocation—Rev. L. P. McDonald, Council Bluffs.</span>

<span class="l">Address—Governor Silas A. Holcomb, Nebraska.</span></span>

<p>Upon conclusion of the exercises the honored guests were entertained
at luncheon at the Markel Café, spending the evening enjoying the fireworks.
and the scenes on the Grand Court and in the Midway.</p>

<p>POTTAWATTAMIE COUNTY DAY—June 23, 1898</p>

<p>The affectionate relations of sisterhood between the Twin Cities, Council
Bluffs and Omaha, were demonstrated and illustrated on Iowa Day by dedicating a part of the day to Pottawattamie County, of which Council Bluffs is the
county seat. Council Bluffs indicated early in the history of promotion of
the Exposition that she desired to become a part of the great enterprise, and
to join her twin sister Omaha in making it a great success. To this end she desired to establish a home for her people on the Exposition grounds, and
brought that desire to fruition by constructing a wigwam known as "The:
Pottawattamie County Wigwam," which was dedicated on the afternoon of
Iowa Day immediately preceding the exercises of the State Day. It was constructed on the Bluff tract in close proximity to the Iowa building, and
was one of the most unique structures on the Exposition grounds. While
not claiming any architectural beauty, it was a faithful representation in

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.083.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.083.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.083.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

mammoth proportions of the tepee or dwelling tent of the noble Red Man of
the Plains. The entire construction of the wigwam was placed in the hands of
a special committee of the Association, of which Victor E. Bender was Chairman and Dr. M. Barstow, Prof. J. C. Hisey, Leonard Everett, M. Wollman,
O. P. Wickham, H. W. Bender, A. C. Graham and Colonel W. F. Baker
were the other members. To the untiring energy of the President of the A
Association, A. C. Graham, who personally superintended the building of the
wigwam from the laying of the foundation to the last touches of the decorations, was due the successful completion of this most unique structure.</p>

<p>INDEPENDENCE DAY—July 4, 1898</p>

<p>Independence Day connotes historic events whenever it occurs and wherever it is celebrated. but Independence Day during the Exposition was in
many respects one of the greatest of days. in that it marked the final victory
of the war with Spain, which broke out before the building of the Exposition
was far advanced, and was now ended, while the Exposition was in the zenith
of its glory. In all the one hundred and twenty-two years that intervened
between. the Declaration of Independence and this notable day, the national
holiday was never more strikingly signalized. Mingling with the vast throng
of American men, women and children assembled on the Exposition grounds
were Turks, Algerians, Arabs, Moors and Chinese, who participated in the
great celebration in honor of the stars and stripes.</p>

<p>The glory of the July morning was still in its incipiency when the gates
of the Exposition were thrown open and the people began to pour in. By
ten o'clock every corner of the grounds was thronged with people. The
grounds presented as striking and inspiring a spectacle as ever lay under a
cloudless sky. For the time the incomparable beauties of the Exposition
itself were eclipsed by the brilliant spectacle which it framed. Flags and
streamers innumerable waved over avenues made doubly attractive by the
pretty summer raiment of thousands of women. A dozen bands made the
air tremulous with inspiring strains, and in patriotic mingling of sound and
color the great white buildings glistened like celestial palaces. Thousands
of yards of bunting waved in red. white and blue profusion from every possible
vantage. A thousand flags floated from the staffs of the main building and
streamers of bunting were festooned over the avenues and along the fronts
of the smaller buildings. Even the peanut stands were decorated and a large
proportion of the visitors wore flags pinned on their breasts or fastened to
their hatbands.</p>

<p>The first grand spectacle of the day was the Parade of All Nations, being
a triumphal pageant made up of all the attractions on the Midway. It was
different from any ever witnessed before. The participants were from many
nations of the earth, costumed in the garb of the countries from which they
came. The management of this polyglot parade was in the hands of the
representatives of the different nationalities participating.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, ten o'clock, a. m., the procession moved off as if it
had been arranged by clock-work, the start being made from the West Midway.
Grand Marshal Bostwick was in the lead, accompanied by a detachment of 
the Exposition Police, the members of which cleared the way. Next came
the band from Hagenbach's live animal show, which in turn was followed by
the performing animals from the ring. In the collection Matt. Johnson, the

king of wild animal trainers, was the central feature, occupying a place upon
an open float surrounded by wild beasts from the jungle.</p>

<p>After these came representatives from each of the Midway attractions,
making a column most wonderful in its variety and attractiveness. An interesting feature in the procession was an allegorical representation of an Oriental
wedding and the attendant ceremonies, given by one hundred and twenty-five
olive-skinned natives of the Orient. They hailed from the "Streets of Cairo,"
and had quite an animal show of their own, including a dozen camels, as
many donkeys and half as many horses. The bride was attired in a gorgeous
gown of light blue silk, and with her diminutive groom walked under a canopy
of rich velvet borne by four small boys in blue. The scene represented the
returning march from the wedding ceremony to the home of the groom. There
were bridesmaids in pink and white, the pink waists being as short as the white
skirts were long. They all rode camels and beamed at the crowds through
several layers of rouge. The father of the bride preceded her, and whirled
a sword defiantly, intimidating those who would attempt to steal her. Then
there were attendants of the bride, male and female, some of whom were
mounted while others danced along to familiar Midway strains. The pet
dog of the Streets of Cairo, Nellie Gray, was decorated in red. white and blue
and was accompanied by Arabian children. The tally-ho of the Pabst Company vaudeville hall was a gala affair.</p>

<p>Memories of the pioneer celebration of Independence Day were recalled
by the appearance of the Indians and cowboys connected with the Wild West
Show. The red men and the white men from the mountains and plains made
a striking showing, and their display was one of the creditable features of
the procession. First came the cowboy band, seventy musicians dressed in
corduroy trousers with heavy boots. blue flannel shirts, bandana ties and big
sombreros, playing popular airs along the line of march. Then there were
fifty riders representing the real Western cowboy and the representation was
typical throughout, to the wonder and delight of the people from the East,
whose only conception of the real Western cowboy life was obtained from
dime novels and yellow journals. A dozen Indians followed the riders, and
they were all strikingly painted in the liveliest of war colors. The old stage
coach of the Black Hills, occupied by a score of passengers who had lost the
typical expression of anxiety prevalent in the pioneer days, lest they should be
held up by bandits before reaching their destination, followed. Then came the
immigrant wagon, which had plainly seen better days.</p>

<p>"The Heathen Chinee" from the Chinese Village, fifty strong, had with
them the musical instruments of their native country and were clothed in their
native holiday garb.</p>

<p>FIREWORKS—FOURTH OF JULY</p>
 
</div>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.089.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.089.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.089.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The Bombardment of Matanzas was represented by a party of men on a
gaudy float, all of whom were clothed in sailor uniforms, and in addition
there was a miniature reproduction of the harbor of Matanzas as it appeared
before the guns of the American fleet were turned upon the city. Just to
give emphasis to the spirit of '98, "The Destruction of the Maine" was represented by a float upon which there was a hundred-pound cannon together 
with a band of marines. This float was cheered along the lines of march.</p>

<p>One of the most notable displays was made by the German Villagers. It
included two immense floats, each drawn by six horses, and five well-filled
carriages trimmed in red, white and blue, conveying the management and the
singers, dancers and acrobats who amused the villagers and guests by day and
by night.</p>

<p>Over two hundred swarthy men and women in charge of the "Only"
Gaston Akoun, represented the Streets of All Nations, and formed a fitting
conclusion of the unique parade. Camels and donkeys ridden and driven by
people from a dozen countries, all clothed in the garb of the nations which
they represented, richly decorated, presented an attractive feature as they
marched from one end of the line to the other. Oriental songs were sung and
to the music the sword fighters kept time with their weapons and shields.
The actresses of the "Streets," clad in raiment of finest silk from which
innumerable jewels glistened, rode in carriages.</p>

<p>The program of the day was as follows:</p>

<p>Music—Fourth Regiment Band. Sioux City.
Invocation—Rev. T. J. Mackay, Omaha.
Music—"America," Exposition Chorus.
Reading of the Declaration of Independence—Hon. John C. Wharton, Omaha.
Oration—Hon. James M. Beck.</p>

<p>The program was interrupted after the music of the Fourth Regiment
Band by receipt by President Wattles of a war bulletin, announcing that
General Shafter had submitted an ultimatum of unconditional surrender to
the Spanish troops defending Santiago, and that his lines completely surrounded the town from the bay on the north of the city to a point on San Juan River on the south. Later on the celebration was again interrupted by receipt of a bulletin as follows:</p>

<p>PLAYA, via Hayti, 3:15 a. m.: The fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present the destruction of the whole of Cervera's fleet. No one escaped. It attempted to escape at 9:30 a. m., and at two p. m. the last, the Christobal Colon, had run ashore six miles west of Santiago and had let down its colors. The Infanta Marie Teresa, Oquendo and Vizcaya were forced ashore, and were burned and blown up within twenty miles of Santiago; the Furor and the Pluton were destroyed within four miles of the port. Loss, one killed and two wounded. Enemy's loss probably several hundred from gunfire, explosion and drowning. About thirteen hundred prisoners, including Admiral Cervera.</p>

<p>As this was the dispatch which marked the end of the war with Spain, it
is needless to add that the enthusiasm was so intense that bedlam might be
said to have broken loose among the multitude and the scenes under similar
circumstances on Illinois Day were re-enacted. The celebration continued
well into the night.</p>

<p>The usual display of fireworks was augmented by the illumination of the
Midway, and the Street presented a most animated scene from end to end.
Hundreds of red, white and blue fires turned night into day.
It is estimated that twenty-five thousand people gathered on the North
Tract, to view the fireworks, which were entirely in keeping with the importance of the day and its events. There were bombs in profusion, the showers of colored stars which burst from the flying balls lighting up the heavens with many colors. Skyrockets and Roman candles of the latest type, flowerpots. snakes and all the devices common to modern pyrotechnic art formed a background for the display of elaborate set-pieces which won the plaudits of
the assembled multitude.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful set-pieces portrayed the "Father of His
Country." The immortal Washington was shown in fire, mounted on a
charger emerging from an arch surmounted by the coat-of-arms of the United
States. Colored fire was used to bring out various parts of the device in the
most effective manner. "Niagara on Fire," was another marvelous piece, as
was a third representing an elephant and a group representing two goats
bucking at one another. The display concluded with a piece representing two
battleships, one flying "Old Glory" and the other the Spanish flag. A battle
was waged in fire for several minutes with bombs and other pyrotechnic
A devices, the conclusion being the extinction of the Spanish ship, which was
the signal to reopen the shouting and enthusiasm of the afternoon. Bedlam
broke loose again and would not be quieted until the lights went out at midnight. This ended one of the greatest of the historic days of the Exposition. The total admissions for Independence Day were 44,452.</p>

<p>Independence Day marked in a way the dividing line between the experimental period and the era of assured success of the Exposition. The eventful and historic days followed in rapid succession, as follows:</p>

<p>Massachusetts Day, July 11; Children's Day, July 14; Military Day,

<p>JUBILEE WEEK</p>

<p>October 10 to October 15 Inclusive</p>

<p>As will be recorded elsewhere in this history, the war with Spain was
begun and ended during the building of the Exposition, and came near to
wrecking it, by reason of the absorption of the whole people in that sanguinary
event to the exclusion of other things; but out of it came the Peace Jubilee
of the Exposition, the most brilliant of the historic events.
This jubilee occupied the week October 10 to 15, inclusive. Ever
since the close of the Spanish War, arrangements had been vigorously carried
on to make this Jubilee well worthy of our great nation. Much thought,
time and money had been expended by the Exposition management to make it
a crowning success. The President of the United States, with his Cabinet,
the Diplomatic, Corps, and the prominent generals of the army and navy,
from the seat of government had been invited, and responded with cheerful
enthusiasm. A member of the Executive Committee was sent to Washington
to accompany the special trains which were to transfer them to Omaha.
Representatives of the great newspapers of the country also accompanied
them.</p>

<p>MAYORS' DAY</p>

<p>The opening day of Jubilee week was Monday, October 10, and was
denominated Mayors' Day. The Mayors of the principal cities of the West
were invited to attend and participate in the exercises. Many were present,
but with the usual modesty of these distinguished officials, but few participated in the exercises as speakers. The exercises were held in the Auditorium at eleven o'clock a. m., with the following program:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music—Omaha Concert Band.</span>
<span class="l">Invocation—Rev. T. J. Mackay.</span>

<span class="l">Music—Omaha Concert Band.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Mayor John MacVickar, Des Moines,Iowa.</span>
<span class="l">Music—Omaha Concert Band.</span></span>

<p>After the exercises a luncheon was served at the Markel Café, and the
remainder of the day was spent in viewing the many special attractions on the
Exposition grounds, and the grand illumination and fireworks in the evening.</p>

<p>GOVERNORS' DAY—October 11, 1898</p>

<p>The Governors of all the Trans-Mississippi States had been invited to
attend and participate in the exercises of Governors' Day, but few were

to the celebration of their State Days. The exercises were held in the
Auditorium at eleven o'clock a. m., with the following program:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music—Omaha Concert Band.</span>
<span class="l">Invocation—Rev. S. Wright Butler.</span>

<span class="l">Address—President Gurdon W. Wattles.</span>
<span class="l">Music—Omaha Concert Band.</span></span>

<p>After the exercises a luncheon was served to the invited guests at the
Markel Cafe, ad the afternoon was spent in the usual manner.</p>

<p>PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S VISIT</p>

<p>The Board of Governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, in their natty
uniforms, mounted, formed the escort of honor, and as the distinguished 3
guests passed along the streets, tens of thousands of the citizens of Omaha
and visitors greeted the President and the other noted officials with great
enthusiasm. Every available space along the streets was occupied, and in 
front of the Hall, completely filling the street and the Court House lawn,
the largest concourse of people ever gathered within the city awaited the
arrival of the President of the United States and his party. On the reviewing
stand in front of the City Hall were gathered many representative citizens
of Omaha and the Trans-Mississippi territory, and as President McKinley
appeared, a great shout of welcome went up, and it was with great difficulty
that order restored and a way cleared through the street for the passing pageant, which consisted of the electrical parade of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, unexcelled in thee spectacular and artistic beauty of its floats.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.095.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.095.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.095.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>President McKinley paid his respects to the Mayor of the city by an
official call at his office, and after many compliments on the magnificent
spectacle he had witnessed, he retired with the other members of his party and
was conveyed to the Omaha Club, which had been generously tendered by its
members to the exclusive use of the President and his Cabinet during their
sojourn in the city. It became. for the time being, the executive mansion,
and the official flag of the Chief Executive floated from the peak of the flagstaff from sunrise to sunset during the sojourn.</p>

<p>At the Club a magnificent banquet was served to the distinguished
guests by the officers of the Exposition, and it was a late hour when all
retired to await the morning of</p>

<p>PRESIDENT'S DAY—October 12, 1898</p>

<p>The day was ushered in by a glorious sunrise and beautiful sky, giving
promise of a typical Nebraska October day unsurpassed in any clime. At
an early hour, before the gates of the Exposition were opened, thousands of
visitors had made their way by every possible means of conveyance to the
Exposition grounds. It was apparent that the admissions department of the
Exposition would be put to severe test in promptly passing through the gates
the immense throngs sure to attend. Street cars, railway trains, carriages and
every means of conveyance were taxed to the utmost to carry the crowds to
the Exposition grounds. The total admissions for the day were 98,845.</p>

<p>The Second Nebraska Regiment, just returned from the campaign of
the war with Spain, assisted in preserving order on the grounds. The
regiment was drawn up in two solid lines reaching from the entrances to the
Bluff tract to the grand stand on the Grand Plaza, forming a passage way
for the President and his escort through the immense crowds filling the
grounds. At Iozgo the distinguished guests in carriages, in the order of the
evening before, arrived at the grounds and were admitted and passed through
the avenue to the grand stand where the exercises of the day were held. In
front of the grand stand, reaching westward to the viaduct, and on all sides.
was gathered an audience such as will probably never be seen again within
this city. It has been estimated that this audience numbered seventy thousand
people. The exercises of the day consisted of the following program;</p>

<p>PRESIDENT WATTLES INTRODUCING PRESIDENT McKINLEY</p>
 
</div>

<p>At the close of these exercises an informal reception was held and
congratulations were extended to the President by the Exposition officials
and other prominent guests on the platform. A great cheer went up from the
immense audience, but President McKinley, with his usual thoughtfulness for
others, suggested to President Wattles that the crowds were cheering for
General Miles and other distinguished officers who had not participated in
the program, and, at his suggestion. General Miles, the members of his
Cabinet, and others, were called out and introduced to the enthusiastic throng
in order that they, his associates, might share the honors that, he said, were
due to them as much as to himself. His delicate thoughtfulness for the
pleasure of others was here manifested, and was again illustrated when he
handed to President Wattles the original manuscript from which he had
read his address, as a souvenir of the occasion.</p>

<p>After the general handshaking and cheering at the grand stand had
been concluded, the ladies were escorted to the carriages and departed at
once for the executive mansion (Omaha Club), where a formal luncheon
had been prepared in anticipation of the presence of Mrs. McKinley.
Unfortunately, she had been detained by the death of her brother at her home
in Canton, Ohio, but the ladies of members of the Cabinet and of other officials
of the President's party, with the ladies of the Bureau of Entertainment,
were served. This luncheon was one of unusual elegance. The rooms of
the Club were filled with roses. The tables were arranged in the form of a
hollow square. The luncheon card was printed on white satin ribbon attached
to heavy cardboard, and ornamented with hand-painted sketches. The menu
was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg menu">
<span class="l">Grape Fruit</span>
<span class="l">Consomme</span>
<span class="l">Frogs' Legs a la Poulette</span>
<span class="l">Breast of Chicken</span>
<span class="l">Currant Jelly</span>
<span class="l">Waldorf Salad</span>
<span class="l">Neapolitan Ice Cream</span>
<span class="l">Assorted Cake</span>
<span class="l">Small Coffee.</span></span>

<p>Mrs. Clement Chase, Chairman of the Bureau of Entertainment, presided.
At her right sat the wife of the Chinese Minister. At her left the wife of the
Corean Minister. Next in order at her right sat Mrs. H. T. Clark and Mrs.
Lyman J. Gage, and at her left Mrs. Wattles and Mrs. Charles Emory Smith.
Seated at the other tables were Mrs. Kirkendall, Miss Wilson, Mrs. Webster,
Mrs. Miles, Mrs. Summers, Mrs. Humphrey, Mrs. Manderson, Mrs. Moore,
Mrs. Babcock, Mrs. Miles, Mrs. Cowin, Mrs. Adams, Mrs. Lindsey, Mrs.

<p>The gentlemen of the party repaired to the Markel Café, where a formal
luncheon was served to them. At this luncheon no toasts were given, but
the health of the President was pledged by all present.</p>

<p>The program of the day had been arranged with the special plan of
allowing as many of those in the grounds as possible the privilege of seeing
the President at short range. The soldiers of the Second Regiment were
formed in two lines around the Grand Court, through the center aisles of
each of the main buildings, and after the luncheon, the President, escorted
by President Wattles, and followed by the other officials in their order,
marched between these lines of soldiers, completely around the Grand Court,
stopping in the Government building, in which it had been planned to hold a
public reception. The Government Commission had admitted several hundred
officials and citizens by card, and after these had been presented to the President, it soon became evident that it would be impracticable to receive the general public, as the President was weary with handshaking. This feature of
the program was therefore abandoned and the party proceeded to the rooms of
the Bureau of Entertainment in the Palace of Mines and Mining, where a short
rest was enjoyed, awaiting the arrival of the ladies from the Omaha Club.</p>

<p>Thousands of women delegates to the Trans-Mississippi Congress of the
Federation of Women's Clubs had congregated, and by special appointment
President McKinley and President Wattles visited for a few moments this
gathering of the representative women of the West. President McKinley was
introduced and spoke a few words. Carriages were then taken and the guests
were conveyed through the Midway and over the north viaduct to the Indian
Encampment. Here the "Great Father" was welcomed by the Indian tribes
with an enthusiasm and in a manner never to be forgotten. A grand parade
of the many tribes, bedecked in costumes peculiar to their original customs,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.100.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.100.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.100.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

was led past the reviewing stand by Captain Mercer, who had the Indian
Congress in charge.</p>

<p>Next a sham battle of Indian braves was fought, which was made so
realistic that it almost seemed to be a re-enactment of one of the bloody battles in earlier times. This display of savage life was much enjoyed by the
President and all who witnessed it, and at its conclusion many of the Indians
gathered near the exit of the reviewing stand to see, and if might be, speak

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Grand Court, Looking Southwest, Night</p>
 
</div>

with the "Great Father," whom they regarded with awe, as he came among
them.</p>

<p>After the close of this feature of the exercises of the day. the President
insisted on the carriages being dismissed, and walked back to the cafe where
dinner was to be served. The way led past the livestock exhibits, and many
of the finest animals of this exhibit were displayed with great pride by their
owners to the President as he passed. The gay throngs on the Midway
cheered him, the old soldiers called his name in endearing terms, and the
journey was one of interest and pleasure, with no single word of discourtesy
to mar a day filled with many pleasing events.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.101.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.101.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.101.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The dinner at the café had been planned with great care, and to it had
been invited all the officers of the Exposition, the Executive Committee, and
the full Board of Directors. Also members of the Government Exposition
Commission, members of the State Commissions and numerous prominent
citizens. The long tables entirely filled the north café, and were beautifully
decorated with flowers. The menu was one of especial elegance and design.
A reproduction of the Government building appeared on the first page. On
the second page was lithographed</p>

<p>PEACE JUBILEE DINNER
IN HONOR OF
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION
OMAHA</p>

<p>Wednesday, October Twelfth, 1898.</p>

<p>The menu proper was lithographed over a scene on the Exposition
grounds, which formed the background, and was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg menu">
<span class="l">Blue Points</span>
<span class="l">Celery</span>
<span class="l">Clear Green Turtle</span>
<span class="l">Olives Radishes</span>
<span class="l">Planked Whitefish, with fine Herbs</span>
<span class="l">Dressed Cucumbers</span>
<span class="l">Braised Lamb Chops</span>
<span class="l">Roast Canvasback Duck with Cresses</span>
<span class="l">Hominy Champagne</span>
<span class="l">Lettuce Salad</span>
<span class="l">Ice Cream in Forms</span>
<span class="l">Cakes Fruits</span>
<span class="l">Brie Cheese Crackers</span>
<span class="l">Coffee.</span></span>

<p>President Wattles sat at the head of the table with President McKinley
at his right. The members of the President's Cabinet and foreign Ministers
were seated on either side according to rank. The dinner was faultlessly
served. No formal toasts had been planned, but as the evening was too cool
to carry out the original plan of a gondola excursion on the Lagoon, it was
suggested that an hour be spent in listening to impromptu speeches. Toasts
were assigned by President Wattles at President McKinley's suggestion, as
follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">"Our Country"—St. Clair McKelway, editor of the Brooklyn <em class="hi">Eagle</em></span>
<span class="l">"From War to Peace"—General Nelson A. Miles.</span>
<span class="l">"Humanity"—Senator John M. Thurston, Nebraska.</span>
<span class="l">"The Exposition"—General Charles F. Manderson, Omaha.</span>
<span class="l">"The New West"—Governor Alva Adams, Colorado.</span></span>

<p>OVATION TO PRESIDENT McKINLEY</p>
 
</div>

<p>After the responses, which were exceptionally interesting, the guests
repaired to their carriages and were driven around the Court of Honor, and
to the grounds set aside for the display of fireworks on the North tract. A
magnificent display had been specially prepared for this occasion, and it was
greatly enjoyed by the President and his party, as well as the tens of thousands
of visitors who witnessed it. The carriages then conveyed the distinguished
guests to the executive mansion, and thus closed the President's day at the
Exposition.</p>

<p>The President had planned to leave the City of St. Louis early the
following morning, and without ceremony he was escorted to the station. A
large number had gathered to see him once more and say "good-bye." Before
leaving the club house he had written a note to General Manderson, the
President of the Club, as follows:</p>

<p><em class="hi">Dear General Manderson:</em></p>

<p>Before I go permit me to thank you. My visit to Omaha has been one of uncommon
interest and pleasure. Good-bye.</p>

<p>October 13, 1898. WILLIAM MCKINLEY.</p>

<p>The President expressed to President Wattles his appreciation of the
manner in which he had been entertained. He said:</p>

<p>I want to congratulate Omaha on the splendid management of every detail of my
reception, which was carried out most satisfactorily and in the best way possible.</p>

<p>As his train was about to start, he responded to the cheer of the crowd
gathered about his car as follows:</p>

<p>I thank you more than words can tell for your many kindnesses to me during my visit s to your city and your magnificent Exposition. My visit to Omaha and to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition is one that I shall long remember with the kindliest recollections. What has pleased me more than anything else on my entire trip is to witness the exhibitions of patriotism throughout the country. I am glad to see. that in Nebraska, as through the whole land, the people ever love good government, and dearly love the old flag. It is very hard for me to say good-bye to Omaha; you have all made my trip so delightful; but I must say good-bye now, as the train is about to leave. Again I thank you.</p>

<p>ARMY AND NAVY DAY—October 13, 1898</p>

<p>The fourth day of jubilee week was dedicated to the army and navy.
After the departure of the President and his party, the officials of the Exposition repaired to the hotels and with carriage escorted General Miles and staff,
with other generals, ministers and officials who were to participate in the
celebration of Army and Navy Day, to the Exposition grounds. The
exercises were held in the Auditorium at eleven o'clock a. m.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.104.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.104.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.104.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The program was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music—By Modoc Glee Club, Topeka, Kan., "Hail Flag of the Free."</span>
<span class="l">Welcome—Governor Silas A. Holcomb. Nebraska.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Major-General Nelson A. Miles.</span>
<span class="l">Music—Modoc Glee Club.</span>
<span class="l">Address—General A. W. Greely.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Senor Gonzales de Quesada, Cuba.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Senator William V. Allen, Nebraska.</span></span>

<p>(The addresses will be found in Part II of this history.)</p>

<p>At the conclusion of these exercises, a luncheon was served to the distinguished guests at the Markel Café, after which the guests repaired to the
grounds of the Indian encampment, where a special program had been
arranged in honor of General Miles. He had long been known as one of the
heroes of the Civil War and one of the great Indian fighters who for more
than a quarter of a century had been stationed at outlying posts on the frontier.
It was General Miles who captured Geronimo, the famous Apache chief, and
negotiated the terms of surrender of the Indian warriors. The meeting on
the grounds between the General and this famous Indian chief was affecting.
Geronimo clasped his arms about the General and embraced him affectionately.
After this episode, General Miles pinned a peace jubilee badge on the breast
of the Indian warrior, who expressed thanks in broken English.</p>

<p>After the sham battle, then in progress, was conducted, General Miles
and the Apache chief held a long conference through an interpreter, no doubt
reminding each other of stirring events in their lives, when Geronimo led his
Warriors against the whites and defied them in many sanguinary contests.</p>

<p>CIVIL GOVERNMENT DAY—October 14, 1898</p>

<p>The fifth day of jubilee week was dedicated to civil government. Great
crowds still lingered at the Exposition, although the weather had turned cold
and disagreeable, and the Auditorium was well filled to hear the interesting
exercises which had been planned in celebration of this day. Brigadier-General
William R. Shaffer and staff had arrived too late to participate in the

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt</p>
 
</div>

celebration of Army and Navy Day, and he had therefore been invited to
speak on this occasion. His presence lent interest to the event and thousands
of visitors filled the Auditorium to overflowing to see and listen to this
famous warrior. When he appeared on the platform in full uniform he was
greeted with a rousing cheer.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.106.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.106.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.106.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The program of exercises was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg list">
<span class="l">Music—Omaha Concert Band.</span>
<span class="l">Invocation—Rev. Newton R. Mann.</span>
<span class="l">Address—Brigadier-General William R. Shafter.</span>

<p>After the exercises the usual luncheon was served to the honored guests
in the Markel Café and the afternoon and evening were spent in witnessing
the sham battle in the Indian encampment grounds, the fireworks and other
special attractions.</p>

<p>CHILDREN'S DAY—October 15, 1898</p>

<p>The sixth and last day of jubilee week was dedicated to the children.
A low admission fee had been fixed for the children on this day, and they
came by thousands from the city and surrounding country to participate in
the exercises. No formal exercises were held, but they sang patriotic songs,

with the accompaniment of Innes' band. in the afternoon on the Grand Plaza,
and spent the day as only children can, in the enjoyment of the many interesting
amusements throughout the Midway, on the Lagoon and in the Exhibit
buildings.</p>

<p>This closed the most successful week, in point of attendance and interesting ceremonies, of all the Exposition period. The total attendance for the week was 294,344.</p>

<p>Following jubilee week the special days until the close of the Exposition
period were as follows:</p>

<p>German Day, October 18; Ancient Order of United Workmen Day,
October 18; Nebraska Day, October 19; Utah Day, October 20; Railroad
Week, October 23 to 29, inclusive; Tri-City Day, October 26; and then came
the last of the great days.</p>

<p>OMAHA DAY—October 31, 1898</p>

<p>The success of the Exposition from every standpoint had become an
established fact. Anxiety had given place to realization, and with it that
comforting peace which is the reward of success as the result of untiring effort.
Much pressure had been brought to bear upon the management to continue the
Exposition beyond the date fixed in the original plans, but the same wise
judgment that had carried the creation of the great undertaking to completion,
so that the gates were thrown open on the appointed day, and at the appointed
hour, and had made the Exposition period the unparalleled success in every
detail and feature that it had now become, prevailed. The gates were closed
for the last time upon the appointed day and hour, which was at the last
moment at midnight October 31, 1898. The day was dedicated to Omaha,
and like the opening day it was ushered in by a matchless Western sunrise;
another typical Nebraska autumn day, with faultless sky, and balmy, invigorating air. </p>

<p>Every effort had been put forth to make of it a fitting termination of an
historic period in the life of the city. The Mayor had issued a proclamation,
A reciting the many benefits that Omaha had received from the Exposition,
praising its management, and declaring Omaha Day an official holiday. He
urged all places of business to close, and every citizen to attend the Exposition
that day. The Board of Education ordered the schools closed, the Commercial Club and labor organizations urged the merchants and tradesmen
to participate in a universal celebration of this holiday, and every citizen of
Omaha seemed to take upon himself the responsibility of working for the

Exposition, city and county officials, members of the Board of Education,
the Executive Committee of the Commercial Club, the Board of Governors
of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, and many other prominent citizens of Omaha
who had all lent their aid to the success of the Exposition. Many toasts were
responded to by the guests of the officers of the Exposition. Words of praise
of their efforts were spoken with regrets that the beautiful White City. with
all its enchantment, was so soon to be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>In the evening, a grand spectacular display of fireworks was given and
witnessed by many thousands, after which a Grand Carnival on the Streets

<p>ARCHITECTURE AND ELECTRICAL ILLUMINATIONS</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV</p>

<p>ARCHITECTURALLY, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition was a magnificent success. After all its brilliant features shall have faded from the memory
of the hundreds of thousands of men and women who witnessed them, the matchless beauty of its architecture will remain an ineffaceable picture, never to be forgotten. Its appeal to the popular imagination was stronger than that of any other creation among the manifold attractions of a great exposition, and its splendid artistic effects made a lasting impression upon its people.</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Exposition had the unique quality of
being a complete artistic whole. From its conception until its
achievement there was a consistent idea present, which was accomplished without serious omissions, and of which the general effect
was so focused that it was readily comprehended and did not weary
by complexity of plan or of composition or detail. Nor on the other
hand did it show any lack of variety, nor of both general and individual study
of the buildings and their environment. There was everywhere evidence of
the adaptation of the general scheme to the site, of study of proportions
of the buildings to each other and of their relation to the ground 
immediately around them. No detail, from that of relative proportions of
masses to the lines of balustrades and even to the distribution of the colors in
the bannerettes, was overlooked, and the final result justified the care bestowed
upon the problem. In expenditure and size, this Exposition could not compete with that of Chicago in 1893, and whatever individual character it could
expect to have was necessarily that of distinction. Considerations of economy
forbade the use of color decoration. Distinction was secured, however, through
simplicity of treatment and by harmony of form, throughout. In its inception,
it was recognized that a general type of architecture must be maintained, a

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.112.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.112.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.112.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

general color demanded, and a general scale required. None of these essentials was new in idea, as they were an expression of natural common sense in designing a scheme for a correlated group of buildings.</p>

<p>But there were two factors in the design of the main court of the Omaha
Exposition which were new, and have not been insisted upon elsewhere. First,
the requirement that all towers and vertical motives should be placed only
where they were indicated upon the general plan, and that but one prominent
dome should be permitted, which should be placed at the termination of the
longest vista; and second, that as far as possible, no portion of the private
buildings or grounds outside the main court of the Exposition should be seen
from that court. For this purpose all the Exposition buildings upon the main
court were connected with colonnades back of which were screens of trees.

</div>

and the court became a vast cloister isolated from all incongruous elements of
architecture. Often in the last decade, the praise has been heard for this
Exposition that it seemed the most perfect as a whole of any of the expositions
of the past.</p>

<p>In some respects this was due to the site. The main court-one-half
mile (or more) in length—rose slightly from west to east, and had a lagoon
upon its long axis which spread into a large basin almost level with its surface
at the west, and lay between the high banks of terraces and steps at the east,
which rose to a bridge spanning Sherman Avenue and leading to the concourse
for addresses, etc., and to the more informal portion of the Exposition grounds.
At the western end of the great court, the long facade of the Government
building was reflected in the basin, which was surrounded by colonnades suggestive of the approaches to St. Peter's at Rome, by Bernini. Above rose

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.113.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.113.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.113.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the one great dome in the Exposition, admirably proportioned, completing the
vista in this direction. At the east the terraces clustered, and the entrance to
the bridge was flanked by two high towers above the restaurants. The view
of the court from the terrace looking westward was very beautiful and gave f
a thoroughly comprehensive idea of the general Exposition plan. At the left
and south was the Mines building by S. S. Beman, of Chicago, with Greek
Ionic detail. garden with peristyles and statues connected this building

</div>

with the Liberal Arts building by Messrs. Fisher &amp; Lawrie, of Omaha, which
had the charm of the best type of sixteenth century French Renaissance.
Opposite the Mines building, on the north of the lagoon, was the Machinery
and Electricity building by Dwight Heald Perkins, of Chicago, with
characteristic detail; while opposite the Liberal Arts was the building for
Manufactures by J. J. Humphreys, of Denver. These four buildings with their
connecting colonnades completed the end of the court east of the central cross axis. Upon this short axis was the main bridge crossing the lagoon, a double
bridge with a balustraded island in the center. At the south of this axis was
the main entrance arch of the Trans-Mississippi States, its frieze formed by

a double row of the coats-of-arms of the States in color. Opposite on the
north end of the axis was the Administration building, in the form of an arch
with a hall above and a high roof and lantern, somewhat resembling the
arched gateways of medieval towns, but with classic detail. p Both of these
arches, as well as all the accessory architecture of the Exposition, the lagoon,
the terraces, balustrades, peristyles, colonnades, etc., and the two large restaurant buildings at the eastern end of the court, were designed by Messrs.
Walker and Kimball, Architects-in-Chief of the Exposition. Beyond the
central cross axis to the west, on either side of the lagoon, were two of the
most important buildings on the grounds—to the north the Agricultural
building by Cass Gilbert, of St. Paul and New York; to the south the Fine Arts
building by Messrs. Eames and

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Ceres</p>
 
</div>

Young, of St. Louis. Both in proportions and details these buildings
compare favorably with the architectural creations of any exposition.
All the buildings in the main court,
with the exception of the Art building, were designed according to
definite dimensions an d instructions
supplied by the architects-in-chief,
which were as follows: </p>

<p>All buildings should be of
simple classic or Renaissance style,
without excess of ornament. The
height of the order to the top of the
entablature was determined. There
should be no towers. Each building should have a dominant central pavilion
and subordinate corner pavilions, and the colonnades, arcades, or subdivisions i
of spaces between the pavilions should be absolute repeats of a uniform scale,
said scale being stated. The buildings should all be ivory white, and the roofs
of a uniform shade of gray green.</p>

<p>As a result, while there was great variety in conception and in minor
details, the buildings were harmonious, not alone in one factor, but in all the
following factors—style, color, scale, height, and general mass. In no other
exposition have instructions been so strenuous, style and height being the only
conditions usually imposed; and in consequence, all other expositions have
suffered from the exploitation of the eccentricities of individual architects.
The Art Palace was a double building with a cloistered court between its two
portions. This was caused by the logical separation of painting and sculpture. In all other respects it conformed to the instructions. Three exceptions

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.116.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.116.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.116.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

were made in the buildings in the grand court, all of which were to accent
main axes. The Government building at the west end had, as requested, a
dome accentuating that end. The Restaurant building at the east end had two
identical towers to balance the Government dome and accent the bridge
entrance; and the Administration building had a high roof and lantern to accent
the entrance to the long avenue at right angles to the main court—a continuation of the cross axis, on either of which were the secondary buildings for Transportation, Dairy, Apiary, etc. These buildings were designed in a simple style, distinct from all others, being half timber and plaster buildings with heavy projecting eaves. One important building alone was on the tract across the bridge and south of the concourse—the Horticultural building
in the midst of its gardens and fountains, by Chas. Beindorff, of Omaha. This
building, being isolated, had no restrictions placed upon it excepting as to
style of architecture and color, and had many picturesque pinnacles.</p>

<p>On either side of the gardens of the Horticultural Hall were the State
buildings—of the usual various characters and merits. North from the concourse stretched the Midway, which turned to the west and joined the northerly end of the cross avenue. The general effect of the Exposition, as may be readily seen, was simple, easily comprehended, and thoroughly complete.
The views were very beautiful, as the light and shade on the gardens connecting
the white masses of the buildings gave delightful contrast and detail; and the
absence of arid spaces and the constant presence of shaded ways between the
buildings were very grateful to those walking through the grounds. Nor
should the sculpture be omitted in an appreciation of the whole. There were
no monumental and sensational groups, and most of the sculpture was
associated with the architecture, and was in pediments or over openings, or
as single figures upon the posts of balustrades; but it was admirable in scale
and gave the charm of statues half hidden in the foliage of English gardens
or of Italian villas. In no exposition has sculpture been so little ostentatious; and in no exposition has it been so thoroughly in harmony with its surroundings.</p>

<p>In the lighting of the Exposition the skill of Luther Stieringer and
his able assistant, Henry Rustin, was apparent. Stieringer's ingenuity and
conception of light-effects were very exceptional. He thoroughly appreciated
the advantage of maintaining the effect of perspective by eliminating all vertical lines of light, and the beauty of reflected light from surfaces, its sources being concealed. The charm of the delicate lighting of the grand court when seen from the terraces has not been surpassed.</p>

<p>The landscape work of Rudolph Ulrich, who seemed to possess the magic
of an Indian fakir in the rapidity with which he obtained effects and made
foliage grow, was of admirable merit. To him was due the "planting-out" of

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.117.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.117.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.117.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

all unsightly things, both within and without the grounds, even blemishes
being transmuted into beauty-spots by his intelligent handling. He took great
pride in the flourishing appearance of the sod everywhere, which he coaxed
along with wonderful speed and success. He laid out and constructed the
walks and drives of the Exposition—details no less essential to its perfection, if less imposing, than the finest structure within its walls.</p>

<p>In fact, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition maintained in all its artistic
expression a standard which appealed irresistibly to the most exacting of its
visitors. This result was primarily due to the high artistic standard set by
Messrs. Walker and Kimball, architects-in-chief, and carefully maintained by
them and their associates in every detail of architectural design. The responsibility for success or failure rested upon the architects-in-chief, and if their original conception of the general plan of a completed architectural whole had proved abortive, these two men would have had to bear the brunt of adverse criticism and consequent hurt to professional reputation. This being true, they were, on the other hand, entitled to receive and did receive unstinted praise for their great achievement, which earned for them recognition in eminent degree and gave them place among the foremost architects of the nation.</p>

<p>THE BUILDINGS</p>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<p>THE U. S. GOVERNMENT BUILDING</p>

<p>This, the building of first importance and dignity, was all that it should
be—a fine example of symmetry and perfect outline, a contribution to architectural art worthy of the nation. Its first suggestion to the eye of the visitor was a hint of the national capitol, while from another point of view there were slight reminders of St. Peter's at Rome. Standing at the west end of the grounds, this massive Ionic pile dominated a group of buildings whose beauty has never been exceeded. It was planned in three sections, that at the center having a frontage on the lake of two hundred and eight feet, its depth being fifty feet. The main entrance, facing the basin, was reached by a broad flight of steps and through a colonnade, and was flanked on either side by richly decorated pavilions. The central building rose to a colossal dome, towering far above all other structures and surmounted by a figure of "Liberty Enlightening the World"—a reproduction of Bartholdi's famous statue. At night the figure was illuminated, its head crowned with an electric tiara, and the torch in its hand ·a search-light one hundred and seventy-eight feet above the ground.</p>

<p>The side sections, connecting by colonnades with the Agricultural building, had a frontage of one hundred feet and were forty-eight feet high to
top of balustrade. The total length of the building was five hundred and four
feet; its height at pinnacle one hundred and seventy-eight. The floor space,
devoted to exhibits, approximated fifty thousand square feet.</p>

<p>The Government building was produced in the office of the Supervising
Architect of the Treasury at Washington, D. C. The earliest sketches were
made by Geo. O. Totten, Jr., under the supervision of Wm. Martin Aiken,
then Supervising Architect. These were carefully revised and the whole
carried to completion in the ablest manner possible by Edward A. Crane, of
Philadelphia, the building being erected partly during the rule of Acting
Supervising Architect Kemper and finally completed under the supervision
of James Knox Taylor, the present incumbent, who practically inaugurated
with this building his masterly revolution of the Supervising Architect's office, its methods and its product. The colossal statue of the Republic surmounting the dome formed the very pinnacle of the whole composition, and was by the well-known sculptor, James F. Early.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.119.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.119.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.119.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Main Entrance, Agriculture Building</p>
 
</div>

<p>THE AGRICULTURE BUILDING</p>

<p>West of the Twentieth Street axis of the Kountze tract and facing south
on the lagoon, was this building located. Its architecture "free Renaissance,"
its details were conventional in proportion and arrangement, but natural in
subject and all suggestive of the building's purpose. Corn and wheat, garlands
and cornucopias of vegetables, fruits and flowers composed its capitals. In
one of its most conspicuous friezes the strutting turkey-cock with outspread
tail was very effectively used to replace the classic <em class="hi">anthemion</em>.</p>

<p>The richness of effect which results from a lavish use of such natural
ornament was, in the scheme of the designer, to have been enhanced by the
profuse employment of color. In mass the building should conform to the
general "old ivory" tone of its companions; but in its decoration the tints of
nature were to be copied—as the yellow of corn, purple of grapes, red of
apples and green of foliage. The central niche was to blaze with color, and
on either side of the doorway should have been reproduced great paintings,
the "Sower",and "Reaper" of Millet. This additional beauty was lost to the
building through the prudence of the financial management ever listening to
the warning voice of Economy.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.120.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.120.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.120.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The structure was something over four hundred feet long by about one
hundred and fifty wide, and averaged fifty feet high. The main entrance
was a hemicycle in plan, surmounted by a circular niche; smaller doors pierced
the stylobate at intervals along the whole front. The ends had triple doors
with loggias above. A single order of architecture surmounted the stylobate,
crowned with an entablature that was elaborate even for the Corinthian style.
The monotony of the skyline was relieved by statuary representing the seasons, and dominated by a fine group-"Prosperity" supported by "Labor" and "Integrity." Over the main entrance a statue of "Abundance" was flanked
by lesser figures and the arms of State and nation. The sculptured subjects included the "Signs of the Zodiac,"' the "Favorable Winds" 
and the "Seasons;" and panels and friezes everywhere bore names of patrons of agriculture, inventors, and appropriate inscriptions.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Cass Gilbert</p>
 
</div>

<p>It is doubtful if any exposition has ever given its agricultural show as beautiful and elaborate a setting as this. For its design the Exposition was indebted to Cass Gilbert, then of St. Paul, now President of the American Institute of Architects, and one of the leading architects of the country. The Minnesota State Capitol and the U. S. Custom House at New York, two of the most notable architectural works of modern times, are by Cass Gilbert. Franz Engelsmann of St. Louis was the sculptor of the Agriculture building. His work on this building was full of his own characteristic charm and sympathy, and contributed not a little to its artistic success.</p>

<p>THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING</p>

<p>This structure, one of the most distinctive and original in the Exposition,
combining as it did the "triumphal-arch" effect with the practical uses of an
ordinary building, served as general headquarters for Exposition officers and
for the reception of distinguished visitors, and also as a finishing touch to the ensemble of the Court of Honor. Its design was "free classic," though more
influenced by French Renaissance than any other of the main buildings.</p>

<p>It measured fifty by fifty feet on the ground, and was one hundred and
fifty feet in height-nearly as tall as the Government building—and formed
the central feature of the group facing the lagoon. In general effect it was a
solid, rectangular mass with four square pavilions, surmounted by a high-

hipped
 French roof and lantern. To heighten the architectural effect, statuary
of heroic size was used above the cornice. On each of the corner pavilions
were emblematic figures, and at the center of the lagoon front was a group
I symbolizing "Administration." Between the roof and the main cornice an
open space was left for a point of observation, being well above the level
of other roofs. The arch was designed by Messrs. Walker and Kimball, of
Boston and Omaha. The sculpture was by Walter Mettler of Chicago.</p>

<p>THE MANUFACTURES BUILDING</p>

<p>On the other side of the Administration building from "Agriculture"
stood the Manufactures building. "Manufactures" and "Agriculture" were
twins in size and general form, and the largest of the main court buildings,
therefore next in natural sequence to describe. It was a vigorous design in
Roman Doric, full of dignity and repose. Its four-hundred-foot front was
broken at center and ends by very orderly and well-handled pavilions.
The order proper stood thirty feet high, above and on a ten-foot stylobate.
The center pavilion was eighty-five feet high to the top of its crowning
group. The end pavilions were forty feet square, and sixty-five feet high to
the finials that terminated their domical roofs. A particularly light interior
resulted from the very open intercolumniation of the screen of columns that
embellished the main facade, leaving nearly the whole sixteen-foot module
for glass. The entablature was broken over and around the columns of this
screen, producing to a marked degree the dramatic effect that always results
from receding and overhanging planes, recalling.

as it does, the setting of theatrical scenery. The main entrance, through the central pavilion from the south, presented a twenty-four-foot arch, thirty-five feet high, screening an extremely rich rectangular entry or vestibule. Double flanking columns served to accent more strongly this particularly successful central feature. A broken stylobate furnished many resulting pedestals for the excellent statuary with which this building was lavishly adorned. An army of well-proportioned ornamental standards flew the complete gamut of bunting whenever the main court was on dress parade. The late John J. Humphreys of Denver was the architect. Humphreys was one of Denver's famous architectural colony, perhaps that city's most valued asset, even if owed chiefly to considerations

<p>MACHINERY AND ELECTRICITY BUILDING</p>

of climate. In his untimely death the profession lost one of its masters,
and a host of warm admirers one of their most esteemed coufrércs. At Mr.
Humphreys' suggestion Walter Mettler, of Chicago, was appointed sculptor
of the Manufactures building. The wisdom of the choice was fully borne
out by the high artistic standard attained in the work itself.</p>

<p>THE MACHINERY AND ELECTRICITY BUILDING</p>

<p>The home of Machinery and Electricity was in the northeast corner of
the Grand Court, east of the Manufactures building and across the lagoon
from the Mines building. Its design had been governed by general conditions requiring harmony with the surrounding group, whose prevalent feeling was of modern Renaissance.</p>

<p>Its frontage was three hundred and four feet, its depth one hundred and forty-four. There were triple entrances on the first-floor level in the center of the main front, and similar ones in the centers of east and west fronts, with four emergency exits in the north wall. Flanking both sides of the portico sixteen feet wide, running the entire length of the facade. The central entrance feature projected beyond the portico, thus forming the grand vestibule.

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Entrance, Machinery and Electricity Building</p>
 
</div>

The main floor covered the entire area of the building. Above was a gallery
thirty-two feet wide, extending around the four outer walls, and reached by
spacious stairways located in opposite corners of the front. This left a high
central court two hundred and forty-eight feet long by eighty feet wide,
lighted from the skylights and clerestory windows above the roof.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.126.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.126.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.126.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The character of the exhibits here sheltered was indicated by the
decoration. The ornamental spandrels and panels received all of their <em class="hi">motifs</em> from machinery; the cresting at the top was
formed of cogwheels, this idea being carried out in all the decorations. The underlying principle and function of machinery were symbolized by
the statuary on the summit of the building. At each of the four corners were groups representing the early supremacy of Man over the untamed forces of Nature. Complete supremacy was shown by the central group, in which the
entire sculptural design culminated. In this, Man developed beyond the youthful stage, having acquired wisdom, takes these same untamed forces of Nature and harnesses them to his chariot, making them do his bidding—thus symbolizing the services of machinery to

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

</div>

man in utilizing the power of steam, fire, electricity and gravity.
The designer of this building was Dwight Heald Perkins, of Chicago,
President of the Illinois Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
The sculptor appointed by Architect Perkins was Richard W. Bock, of
Chicago, and to him is owed the wonderfully interesting and successful
handling of the sculpture adornment of this building.</p>

<p>THE BOYS' AND GIRLS' BUILDING</p>

<p>This was of unusual and pleasing design, the ground plan being in form
of the letter "T," the stem of the letter forming the rear portion of the
building. The main portion was one hundred feet in width and fifty feet in
depth. The stem ran back fifty feet.</p>

<p>The building was well proportioned, but no attempt was made at
elaboration. It was a one-story structure, with central clerestory. This
arrangement gave plenty of room on the flat roof, which was utilized for a
roof-garden and restaurant. Across the front of the main portion of the
building extended a broad portico with tall columns, and from this, entrance
was had to a large hall, fifty by fifty feet, with a dais at one side for
y speaking, entertainments, etc. High up under the clerestory was a wide
balcony commanding a full view of this great room, with stairs leading to it
from two sides. In each corner of the main portion was a room twenty-five
by nineteen feet in size. One of these was set apart for the girls, and another

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.127.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.127.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.127.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

for the boys; the mothers had the use of a third, and a fourth was devoted
to the exhibit of a model nursery. The rear portion, or stem of the T, was
arranged for the purposes of a creche, where children were cared for while
their mothers enjoyed the sights of the Exposition. The room was fifty by
fifty feet in size, and was fitted with every convenience for tending the little ones. In one of the ells was constructed a shallow pond, where the children could wade and paddle to their heart's content, under the eye of a watchful attendant. In the other ell were a number of sand piles, also for purposes of amusement;. A feature of the exterior decoration was a handsome balustrade extending around the cornice. This was surmounted by figures of
cherubs upholding staffs, from which floated appropriate banners.</p>

<p>The building was designed by Walker &amp; Kimball.</p>

<p>THE AUDITORIUM</p>

<p>The Auditorium stood on the south side of the basin, just east of the Mines
and Mining building, and occupied a space of one hundred and thirty-six by
two hundred and forty-six feet. There were two principal entrances, one on
the east and the other on the north side. The interior was planned after the
manner of a Greek theater, with seats in a semicircle, facing south. The
main floor had a seating capacity of four thousand, and the stage of five
hundred. Opening from the Auditorium, and arranged around the sides were
twelve or more large rooms—dressing rooms for theatrical people, etc. The
interior was treated in the same style as the exterior, with a free use of
ornamental pillars, but no massive columns appeared to break the view of
the audience from any point. The immense roof of the structure was supported entirely by trusses. Special attention was paid by the architects to the
problem of acoustics, and the building was wholly satisfactory in that
regard. It was the work of Messrs. Fisher and Lawrie, of Omaha. Sculptural
enrichment on this building was confined to medallion heads, which were
well executed in <em class="hi">bas relief</em> by Julius Loester, of New York.</p>

<p>MINES AND MINING BUILDING</p>

<p>This building paired with "Machinery and Electricity" on the opposite side
of the lagoon. It was designed in the Greek Ionic order, and was studiously
and exquisitely wrought out in the detail of that most charmingly graceful
of all the antiquities, the Erechtheium at Athens. The chief feature of the
lagoon facade was a circular, domed pavilion one hundred and fifty feet in
circumference, rising to a height of seventy-five feet. The stepped roof of
this pavilion was supported by a circular row of fluted columns, the space

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.128.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.128.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.128.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

surrounded by them being open and forming a grand domed vestibule for
an approach to the building. The inner dome was richly designed with ribs
and panels, and decorated in colors, while the outer one was formed by a
series of steps rising in the form of a cone to the apex, which was crowned
by an ornamental base and flagstaff. The outer row of dome columns was
detached, and the entablature broken around them, over each column being
a statue on its pedestal, with the stylobate of the dome for a background.
This treatment was very monumental in effect, and not only in good taste
and harmonious architecturally, but also original and interesting.
Flanking the central dome were beautiful Ionic colonnades, which
formed covered ways along the entire facade as far as the corner towers, a
feature always keenly appreciated by visitors in
the heat of summer. Over these colonnades 

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

</div>

were balconies of generous size opening from the interior galleries, and affording excellent points from which to view the lagoon and the Grand Court. The four corners of the building were emphasized by square, plain towers, surmounted by ornate open-columned pavilions, circular in form and destined for electric lighting. The designer of this building was Solon S. Beman, of Chicago, an architect of wide reputation, and one of the Architectural Board of the Columbian Exposition. The architect of the Mines building made a judicious choice in his sculptor, for it is doubtful if a more appropriate decoration could have been conceived. Robert P. Bringhurst, of St. Louis, surpassed himself when he created the light-bearing figures which crowned and glorified the entablature of Beman's central dome.</p>

<p>THE LIBERAL ARTS BUILDING</p>

<p>As in the case of the Machinery building, the Liberal Arts building
adhered to the French Renaissance school of architecture. It was located
on the south side of the lagoon, near the Arch of the States. Its exterior
presented the appearance of two stories, the first, or stylobate, being low
in treatment, with small windows cut into a plain wall surface. The second
story was enriched by Corinthian columns set in pairs, with ornamental
windows between, and the roof was finished with an open balustrade, for
airiness of effect. At each corner of the building were pavilions with ornate

pediments projecting from the main wall line sufficiently to give a strong corner treatment. Above the pediments were octagonal bases on which were set
groups of statuary. Each group comprised four heroic figures, the main one
personifying "Liberal Arts," being supported by two kneeling figures suggesting "Industrial Art," while in front of all was a small figure bearing a shield
on which the attributes of pottery and wrought iron were inscribed. The
class of exhibits for which the building was destined was indicated by the

</div>

statuary and ornament so freely used on the exterior. The general effect was
quiet and dignified, and in strict harmony with its neighbors in the Grand
Court.</p>

<p>The Liberal Arts building measured two hundred and forty-six feet in
length by one hundred and thirty in depth. Its main entrances were on the
east, west and north fronts. Its architects were Fisher and Lawrie, of
Omaha. Its sculptor was Julius Loester, of New York.</p>

<p>THE ARCH OF THE STATES</p>

<p>This stately arch, one of the most noticeable structures of the Exposition,
formed the Grand Entrance. It was joined on either side by curved exedras,
partially embracing the plaza before the arch. These exedras contained
the main ticket offices.</p>

<p>The arch itself was fifty feet wide by twenty-five deep, and measured
sixty-eight feet to the top of its parapet. Strong, simple abutments on either
side helped to support an extremely rich and broad frieze of a double arcade
of twenty-four arches, containing shields decorated in color with the coats-

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.132.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.132.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.132.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of-arms
 of the Trans-Mississippi States. The frieze was repeated on the
other side of the arch, while upon the ends were displayed the coats-of-arms
of the remaining States. Above the frieze was a band containing a panel
inscribed "Arch of the States," and above that the decorated cornice with
dentils and <strong>acroteria</strong>. The whole was surmounted by a high parapet, at the center of which on either side was a large shield with the arms of the United
States, under a golden eagle, and upheld by youths bearing masts for the
national colors.</p>

<p>It was expected that this arch should be "built of stone, to form a
permanent memorial of the Exposition, and the future entrance to "Kountze
Park," but this happy thought was not put into execution, and there now
remains nothing to commemorate those scenes of beauty which Omaha is
so proud to have achieved.</p>

<p>The Arch of the States was designed by Walker &amp; Kimball. The
sculpture employed in its decoration was the work of R. P. Bringhurst, of
St. Louis. </p>

<p>THE FINE ARTS BUILDING</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful buildings adorning the Court of Honor was
the Fine Arts building. In shape it was a parallelogram,two hundred and
forty-six feet long and one hundred and thirty wide, its long axis parallel
to the lagoon. It consisted of two separate, symmetrical, domed buildings,
united by a peristylium, or open court, surrounded by colonnades. These rested on a balustraded terrace, and were approached from the plaza by flights of steps, and also from the avenue bordering the canal, which lay north of the building.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Entrance, Fine Arts Building</p>
 
</div>

<p>One entered through the portico and vestibule to the rotunda, similar in each building, and lighted from the top, forming an admirable place for the effective display of statuary. Surrounding this central feature were the galleries, all lighted by skylight, and so planned as to afford the greatest amount of wall surface for the exhibition of pictures, and to allow for the proper circulation of visiting crowds. The two separate wings of the building offered a better opportunity for the classification of material, and at the same time brought the scale of the architecture to its proper relation with the surroundings and the general scheme of the grounds. The colonnade joining the two parts formed an effective feature, conspicuous from the canal and opposite avenue, and afforded a place for the installation of architectural fragments and models, which could not be so suitably disposed within the walls. A touch of landscape art lent additional interest to the treatment of this court.</p>

<p>In the exterior design a somewhat free rendering of classic <em class="hi">motif</em> was adopted, the usual severe simplicity of outline being modified sufficiently to bring it in accord with the purpose of the building. The basis of the design was the Corinthian order, which was used in two dimensions. the larger emphasizing the entrance porticoes and repeated on the gables fronting the canal and opposite side: the smaller was adjusted to the height of the flanking

walls and connecting peristyle, and served to bind the separate elements
into one composition. The designers of the building were Messrs. Eames
&amp; Young, of St. Louis. William S. Eames has since twice been the President
of the American Institute of Architects. To Eames &amp; Young is owed the
introduction of R. P. Bringhurst, of St. Louis, to the Exposition, and to
Bringhurst is due the beautiful sculpture of the Fine Arts Building.</p>

<p>THE HORTICULTURAL BUILDING</p>

<p>The most important feature of the Bluff tract was the Horticulture
building, those of the various States being attractively grouped around it.
Destined for the display of flowers and fruits, it was naturally different in
style and decoration from its companions, much latitude being permitted
the architect. Its dimensions were one hundred and thirty by three hundred
and ten feet, and from the ground to the top of its belfry, one hundred and
sixty feet. The Ionic order was followed in its design, but unconventionally
handled and with somewhat Oriental effect, the details of ornament being, of
course, floral and horticultural in their source.</p>

<p>Towers, or minarets, of Eastern feeling, guarded the sides of an imposing
main entrance, and were repeated on the other three sides, producing an
octagonal form which terminated in the dome. Circular colonnades filled the space between these minarets and were further beautified by Statuary emblematic of the seasons. A balcony above the dome was used as an observatory, affording a magnificent view, not only of the whole Exposition, but of the surrounding country, the picturesque Missouri Valley, and even the city of Council Bluffs, five miles distant. A belfry surmounted this balcony. Octagonal roofed pavilions terminated the wings. Further decorative effect was furnished by a wide frieze of cupids holding high carnival among a profusion of fruits and flowers; and at either side of the entrance, set on the high stylobate, were

</div>

groups of statuary called "Night" and "Morning," intended to be festooned,
one with morning-glories and the other with night-blooming cereus. The
lavish decoration of the building with plants and vines of all varieties, urns
and hanging baskets of flowers, added greatly to its charming effect. The
architect was the late Charles F. Beindorff, of Omaha. The statuary
employed was the work of Julius Loester, of New York.</p>

<p>THE TRANSPORTATION BUILDING</p>

<p>Called the "Transportation and Agricultural Implement Building," this
was the largest of all the Exposition's great buildings, covering five acres.
It was included in the North tract, or "farm group," and was characteristically
built of half-timber and plaster. Its whole surface was marked off into
picturesque panels by an intersecting network of framing timber. posts,
brackets and braces. Deeply-recessed porches sheltered the east and west
entrances, and wide, overhanging, bracketed cornices cast the broad shadows
so effective and so necessary to this style of architecture. All parts of the
interior were pervaded by a soft, amber light, most soothing to the tired eyes
of sightseers, produced by the substitution of tinted translucent fabric for
glass.</p>

<p>This building was designed by Walker &amp; Kimball. It bore no sculpture.</p>

<p>THE DAIRY BUILDING</p>

<p>Like a relative of the Transportation building, a daughter, perhaps, was
this very charming bit of half-timber and plaster work, small enough to make
it possible to take it all in at once. One felt in the presence of a bit of the
France of the Middle Ages-no, rather that of the Trianon-and was almost
disappointed not to be met by Marie Antoinette, or at least one of her make-
believe dairy maids. One was met, however, by just the contents that went
with such a building; or rather, one should say that the building exactly
fitted its purposes and the exhibit it housed. Warm, creamy-white walls.
overlaid with old-burnt-sienna timbering-what could better suggest the
butter and cream within? F. A. Henninger, of Omaha, was certainly at his
best when, as architect, he wrought this little gem of the Exposition.</p>

<p>THE APIARY BUILDING</p>

<p>This building was a worthy mate for the Dairy building. adhering to
its chief features with great fidelity. In minor details were introduced some
characteristic suggestions of its purposes. Half-timber and plaster were the
materials. John McDonald, of Omaha, was the architect.</p>

<p>MINOR BUILDINGS</p>

<p>The State buildings were picturesquely grouped on the Bluff tract, east
of the main Court, and were of at least the usual merit.</p>

<p>Here were buildings for:</p>

<p>Nebraska—McDonald &amp; Craddock, architects, Omaha and Lincoln.
Iowa—Josselyn &amp; Taylor, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Illinois—Wilson &amp; Marshall, architects, Chicago.
Minnesota—James Alan McLeod, architect, St. Paul.
Kansas—John F. Stanton, architect, Topeka.
Wisconsin—Ferry &amp; Clas,architects, Milwaukee.
Montana—Designed by Leo Bonet, of Chicago.
Georgia—Designed by Dunnavant &amp; Thompson, Omaha.
New York—Dunham Wheeler, architect, New York.</p>

<p>There were on the Bluff tract many other interesting structures, mostly
by private owners, such as the pavilions of Montgomery Ward, Chicago:
Bemis Bag Co., Omaha; Liggett Myers Tobacco Co., of St. Louis; and
the curious Nebraska sod house, and the Indian wigwam of Pottawattamie
County, Iowa, and the Moorish and Chinese villages, and the Exposition's
much-admired bandstand, designed, contracted, built and used all within
nineteen days' time.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.139.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.139.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.139.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>On the north were located the Press and Poultry buildings, the former
by Architects Fisher &amp; Lawrie; International Hall, by Architect J. J. Humphreys; and the power plant, warehouse, service, fire and police, and hospital buildings, and live-stock pavilion and sheds, with many minor kiosks and for various purposes, all by the Exposition's own architectural staff.</p>

<p>CONNECTING COLONNADES, ACCESSORIES, ETC.</p>

<p>In the designing of large and complex architectural compositions, the
minor details, accessories, and connecting links have much to do with the ultimate success or failure of the whole. That in this particular the Trans-Mississippi Exposition was fortunate and the result strikingly successful is simple fact. To the connecting colonnades with their continuous lines of shade the Exposition visitor owed not only his physical comfort but his artistic satisfaction as well, for these same colonnades were the means of shutting out a <em class="hi">triste</em> and sordid background; without them it would have been impossible to forget for the moment even where we were, and that the whole was but a dream. To the forest-like repeat of these same column units was largely due the sense of scale, and particularly of distance, which gave to the Grand Court of the Trans-Mississippi the effect of being the most extensive and generous single group ever accomplished in an Exposition design. The fountains and vases, stairways and terraces, balustrades and standards, pedestals and pavilions, even the sanitary kiosks, all played their proper part in joining together, accenting, masking, or enhancing, which made of that grand Court the truly artistic whole that it was. The south viaduct and great restaurant with its double towers formed

a particularly important feature; for had it not to close one end of the vista?
and did it not successfully balance the Government building itself at the opposite end? The north viaduct, connecting two sections of the so-called Midway, was a very pleasing bit of picturesque half-timber work, and combined an important practical function with an interesting bit of Exposition conceit. It was a bridge of concession-stands—a veritable Ponte Vecchio—except that it spanned Sherman Avenue and not the Arno. Messrs. Walker &amp; Kimball, the architects-in-chief, contributed the designs for all of these accessory features. The most successful of the isolated bits of sculpture were furnished by Franz Engelsmann. The splendid figure of Neptune which surmounted the column of the Electric Fountain and so vividly reminded one of John of Bologna's masterpiece in far-away Italy, was by F. H. Wuertz, and was his last work, for he went down with the Bourgogne on his way back to Europe shortly after the Exposition opened.</p>

<p>ORGANIZATION</p>

<p>The architectural division of the Department of Buildings and Grounds
was organized as follows; Walker &amp; Kimball, Boston and Omaha, Architects-in-Chief Cass Gilbert, St. Paul; Eames &amp; Young, St. Louis; S. S. Beman,
Chicago; J. J. Humphreys, Denver; D. H. Perkins, Chicago; Fisher &amp; Lawrie,
Omaha, formed the Architectural Board. H. Weatherwax, of Chicago, was
the chief draughtsman.</p>

<p>Unstinted praise is due to every one of the architects that formed
that incomparable board, and to those other past masters of craft to whom
the Exposition owed its landscape and illumination—Rudolph Ulrich, Luther
Stieringer and Henry Rustin, all of whom have died, each leaving a vacancy
yet unfilled. The group of sculptors—Bock, Bringhurst, Mettler, Engelsmann, Loester and Wuertz—who put the finishing touches of art upon the whole, proved their claim to the highest praise freely bestowed.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.141.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.141.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.141.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>During the existence of the Trans-Mississippi Architectural office, March
19, 1897 to June 15, 1898, a period of 453 days, organization was effected,
a board of architects assembled, a force of draughtsmen and assistants
employed, the general plan or scheme evolved and perfected, a set of rules
made for the guidance of all designers, general dimensions for all the buildings determined, a universal module established; focal points, cornice heights and other important factors in design fixed; with possibly one exception, the

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Main Entrance, Fine Arts Building</p>
 
</div>

actual construction drawings for all the important buildings were made; six
of them, together with all of the accessories, including the lagoon itself, were designed and detailed as well. A careful supervision was given to the work
of all the architects, the complete drawings and details of all the buildings,
great and small, being passed upon with scrupulous care. All of the important
buildings with one exception were specified in the Exposition's own architectural office, and, as a measure of economy, all the duplicating of drawings was accomplished there, too; to use a homely simile, the drawings and prints turned out by this department would have paved Farnam Street, Omaha,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.142.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.142.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.142.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

from 42d to the river, and from building line to building line, while over a
ton of specifications were produced. The site for each concession was determined, and the character of the structures themselves carefully considered. The problem of surface drainage was worked out in the architects' office, and there, too, was made the official map. The landscaping, illumination, decoration and sculpture were all collaborated with the architects-in-chief, and through it all a most voluminous correspondence was found necessary to bring together and harmonize all the widely separated elements. Besides all of these, the regular duties of the office, assistance was afforded to other departments whenever and however required. For "Exhibits" were furnished endless floor diagrams and space computations. F or "Ways and Means" and the official staff a medal was designed and countless estimates of cost made. For "Publicity" many excellent cuts were made from drawings produced
by the architects' office, including that masterly general view for the use of
which Harper's Weekly paid the Exposition management. The cost of
equipping and maintaining this office during the entire period of its existence
was $16,587.35, and included the salary of the architects-in-chief. This is
a trifle over two and a half per cent upon the total cost of the work which
came under its care. Much of this work related to departments apart from
the architecture. The architects were called upon to plan the drainage system
incident to the canal and basin as well as the general system of drainage;
to plan, in a general way, the landscaping, which included bridges, kiosks,
pavements and other constructive work not strictly belonging to the department of architecture. That the architects' office of the Exposition was an
efficient agent in its work is shown by the fact that the unforeseen additions
to contracts commonly called "extras" amounted to less than one-quarter
of one per cent, and that over $100,000 of the amount authorized to be
expended for buildings was not used. It is worthy of note that this was
the first exposition in which piling was used for general foundations
and for anchorage—a single item that saved over one-half the cost of
the foundations. Cold-water paint and translucent fabric were both interesting novelties at this time, having been experimented with only at the
Nashville show being held during our building period. A very valuable
lesson in construction was taught by the use of a different type of truss for
the main span of each of the great buildings. The 80-foot void was bridged
in more than eight different ways, and without an appreciable difference in
the cost.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Gilbert, Eames &amp; Young, and Walker &amp; Kimball of the Architectural Board have since all been similarly connected with the St. Louis World's Fair; and Gilbert, Walker, and Kimball were Roosevelt
appointees on the National Council of Fine Arts; while to Weatherwax has

been entrusted the organization and operation of the draughting departments
of every important exposition that has followed the Trans-Mississippi.
Such was the working history of the office and staff which produced the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition architecture. It certainly is not amiss to
ascribe the success achieved to an unparalleled harmony among the workers
themselves, and the complete subordination of self, without which no great
architectural composition ever realized its possibilities.</p>

<p>ELECTRICAL ILLUMINATIONS</p>

<p>Imagine a great rectangle whose dimensions measure about 3,000 feet by
670 feet, with an almost continuous row of palaces, towers and colonnades
along its outer lines, and with a canal 150 feet wide bisecting its long dimension. It was in a vast theater such as this that the electricians found a rare opportunity for displaying the art of illumination by means of thousands of incandescent bulbs. Never before had they attempted so bold a project
without the aid of the arc lamp, and never before was there so great a triumph
scored in an untried field. More than 20,000 eight and sixteen c.p. bulbs were
used, outlining the principal architectural features of the buildings and placed in clusters on the tops of decorative.columns. This resulted in an illumination highly diffused, widely distributed and with no point of intense brilliancy. The pure white, untinted staff of the buildings and of the columns and colonnades gave a diffused reflection of the incandescent lighting, realizing higher artistic effects than was ever before attained in a large area illuminated artificially. The soft glow of the myriad of lights, somewhat resembling a moonlight, except for the absence of shadows, produced enchanting effects. The comparatively yellow light of the incandescent bulb reflected from the water in the canal gave a beautiful shimmer over the whole surface, enhancing the brilliancy of a scene of unrivalled splendor. A descriptive writer use these words: "The scene at night when the silence is broken only by the lapping of the waters and song of the gondolier and the hum of many voices;
with the great buildings outlined by myriad electric lights; with bridges in
graceful arches spanning the canal penciled with rows of brilliants; with
Venetian boatmen gliding softly down the canal, and with strains of music
faintly heard, was one never to be forgotten. The imagination falters in
vain effort to picture anything more entrancing."</p>

<p>It was like a glimpse into fairyland. The salient points of architecture y
of the Government building were made distinct by these electric starpoints.
The heroic figure, "Liberty Enlightening the .World," surmounting the dome,
wore a scintillating tiara, and the upheld torch illumined a wide area.
Beneath the figure several lines of light girdled the lantern above the dome,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.144.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.144.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.144.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

which was covered by streamers of light apparently held to their places
by five-pointed stars on either side of the dormer windows. Another line of
lights completely encircled the base of dome. Festoons of lights from the dome
to the corner pavilions at either end of the main portion of the great building
were most effective. Arising from the roof of the central portion of the
building a series of Hambeaux supported on shafts of artistic design cast a
radiance upon surrounding objects, the reflection of light upon the allegorical
figures of the upper cornices and flanking the domes producing effects rarely
attained.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of the illuminations was the electrical fountain
designated "Nautilus." In the center was a tall column on the top of which
was seated the figure of Neptune. The fountain consisted of a large number
of jets forming sprays, the whole being some 100 feet in length by about half
that distance in width. The sprays were illuminated. by incandescent lights
rising just above the surface of the water, surrounded by opalescent shades
giving the effect of water lilies. Further illumination of the mirror was
effected by searchlights placed on the colonnades, by means of which all colors
of the rainbow were projected upon the sprays of the fountain.</p>

<p>Rising from the balustrade on the water's edge about the whole canal
were standards painted white with pedestals and crowns carrying circlets of
16-candlepower incandescent lights. Back farther from the water front
between the canal and the buildings were fluted Corinthian columns about ten
feet high also carrying crowns of incandescent lights, which effected a
pleasing illusion, magnifying the height of the buildings.</p>

<p>Every building was outlined with the glowing bulbs. Along cornice,
around window, on pillar, dome and portico the gleaming firefly of the
electrical world made radiant the view. On either side were defined the
colonnades which connected the Government building with its sister buildings
on right and left by pillars of light. The Fine Arts building riveted the
attention with domes light-encircled, cornices ablaze, pillars and pilasters
illuminated. Opposite, across the gently-rippling water-mirror, was the
classical Agriculture building, presenting an opportunity for artistic incandescent decoration. The upper lines, including the balustrades and the
imposing entrance and cornice towers, stood revealed by the numerous electric
punctuation points. The Administration Arch showed its lofty spire outlined
in symmetrical lines of light to the uppermost point. The Manufactures
building had the prominent roof cornices, caps of columns, pedestals and
other points of vantage emblazoned with incandescent lights. Across the
canal the Arch of the States was girdled with bands of light, and the Liberal Arts building was vividly outlined along its cornices. The Mines and
Mining building was especially adapted for this beautiful decoration and right

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.146.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.146.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.146.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

royally was it beribboned and festooned. Its graceful portico was clearly
defined, the towers wore scintillating crowns, the windows shone as if revelry
were within. Pacing this structure was the palace of Machinery and Electricity, with all effective points penciled in light. The east end of the Callal
in front of the two buildings last mentioned in company with the adjacent
terraces, kiosks, landing and broad viaduct leading away from it, was
brilliantly lighted by incandescent lamps supported by fanciful standards of
special design.</p>

<p>Descriptive writers of many leading newspapers confessed their inability
to present upon the written page an adequate reproduction of the wonderful
illuminations. A representative of Harper's Weekly visited the Exposition
and wrote several letters about its manifold attractions. Of the night scene
he said:</p>

<p>"The illumination of the grounds is admirable. I saw the city of Paris
illuminated one night in honor of the return of President Faure from his
successful mission to St. Petersburg, but there was nothing in the illumination
of the French capital to be spoken of in the same breath with the display you

may see any night on the grounds of the Exposition. The Court of Honor,
or whatever name you choose to give it, lies a half-mile along a rippling-waved
lagoon, in its center, bearing many a picturesque gondola. The water reflects
back the thousands of electric lights which define with beautiful distinctness
the great buildings that border the lagoon. In the distance, rising in noble
proportions, its splendid facade marked in soft lines of yellow light, the
Government building stands silhouetted against the dark sky. All down the
court on either side and here and there at short, irregular distances from the
buildings, stand graceful Grecian pillars—upon their tops no flaming torches or glowing, smoking incense, but a knot of brilliant electric lights, symbolical rather of modern investigation than of ancient introspection than of ancient introspection. By day

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

these pillars are fine and interesting, whether singly or in vistas; by night they are peculiarly attractive-a note of rich beauty in the general harmony. From the western end of the court, looking toward the distant viaduct over one of the city streets, the view is scarcely less enchanting. The pillared corridors that connect the main buildings and afford such capital relief from rain or sun have their share of illumination. They join beyond the buildings in a graceful semicircle, or, as it is otherwise called, a hemicycle stairway, rising easily from the lagoon. Above this is a domed projection, under which the speakers stand on special occasions requiring oratorical display: and still above this two lofty minarets, each one bearing a graceful figure standing with
sickle in hand, typical of the harvest. The effect of the illumination, looking
either way from east to west or midway in the great canal, is very beautiful.
Should you call it magnificent—indeed, superb—you would not misapply the words."</p>

<p>At the outstart plans for lighting the Exposition grounds were put into
the hands of Luther Stieringer, a well known New York electrical expert,
who soon turned over the work to the late Henry Rustin, of Omaha. To
Mr. Rustin's creative genius was due all the credit for the marvelous results
achieved.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT BUILDING AND EXHIBITS</p>

<p>CHAPTER V</p>

<p>STANDING at the west end of the Court of Honor,
the great architectural pile erected by the United
States Government loomed up as one of the distinguishing features of a magnificent array of colossal buildings rarely equaled. The extreme length of the building
was 504 feet, made up of three sections having a depth of
150 feet. The center section, 208 feet long, fronted upon the
basin in which the lagoon terminated. The height of this main
portion of the great structure to top of balustrade over cornice was
58 feet. Obviously, the main entrance to the building called for
elaborate architectural effects upon the east side of this center section.
The main portal was reached by a broad flight of steps, through a
colonnade of beautiful, massive design. On either side of the entrance
arose ornate pavilions, capped by richly decorated domes. The main
building was surmounted by a colossal dome of great architectural beauty.
towering far above other structures in the grounds. The dome was capped
by an heroic figure representing "Liberty Enlightening the World," the
torch being 178 feet above the pavement. Upon the pediments of the pavilions
at either side of the main entrance, and just above the balustrade, were placed
groups of statuary of highly artistic design, while at intervals along the
balustrade for the entire length of the main section vari-colored flags fluttered
from staffs set in ornate sockets.</p>

<p>From the base of either pavilion, in front of the building, there extended
a double row of colonnades on either side of the three-lobed basin or lake to
a junction with the Fine Arts building upon the south side of the lagoon and
with the great Agriculture building on the north side. These colonnades,
which greatly enhanced the architectural effects of the west end of the grounds,
formed a covered way for visitors walking to and from the Government building. While this colonnade was not high, it obscured in a measure the end
sections of the building, each of which having a frontage of 148 feet and a

height of 44 feet to top of balustrade. The three sections made up a building
504 feet long, the largest and finest structure the Government had up to that
time erected upon the grounds of an exposition. It was designed under direction of Charles E. Kemper, acting supervising architect of the U. S. Treasury
Department, and was constructed under the direction of K. Taylor, supervising architect. It was designed in the classic style. the Tonic order being used. Happily placed in its relation to other great structures, it was easily the most impressive building on the Exposition grounds, fitly illustrating the dignity and power of the government for which it stood. In outline beautiful in the extreme by day, its massive proportions were penciled and defined at night by rows and festoons of electric lights, producing effects at once novel and charming, affording a source of constant delight to hundreds of thousands of visitors.</p>

<p>The government's exhibit was in perfect keeping with its great building.
Over 46,000 feet of floor space was covered by these varied and highly interesting exhibits, through which the principal departments of Government were
represented. Congress appropriated nearly a quarter of a million dollars to
defray the cost of the building and the placing of the several exhibits, some
of which being located on other parts of the grounds. A chronicle of the
important facts concerning the Exposition of 1898, failing to give due prominence to the rare and comprehensive exhibits of the Government, could not be
regarded as accurate and complete.</p>

<p>Entering through the main portal the visitor beheld an immense hall
literally full of curious, rare and highly interesting objects in such great numbers as to be confusing in the first impression made upon. the mind. Upon
the walls, flags and banners were used in the decoration of panel and frieze,
producing most pleasing effects.</p>

<p>First place was given to the exhibit of the State department, near the
main entrance. An imprint of the great seal of the United States, framed
and beautifully draped with flags. hung over the cases and pictures. There
were medals from the heads of foreign governments to presidents of the
United States commemorating great events; original proclamations of the
presidents, handsomely engrossed; copies of laws enacted by Congress, showing the different forms used, one of which being signed by Gen. Charles
Manderson when he was President <em class="hi">pro tem.</em> of the United States Senate. In another case were a sword and army belt used by Gen. George Washington.
the belt being nearly worn out; a little writing desk upon which Thomas
Jefferson wrote the first draft of the Declaration of Independence; a document conveying to the people of the United States the gratitude of the nobility
of Russia for assistance rendered during the famine of 1892—which recalled
the fact that Nebraska had contributed a train-load of corn to the starving
peasants; in fact, most of the vast amount of grain received by them was sent
from the Trans-Mississippi States. Another object of interest was a big
silk American Hag, woven in one piece, made and paid for by the weavers of
Lyons, France, to pay for which subscriptions were received from 25,000
persons. It was presented to the people of the United States as a token of the
sympathy of the French tendered to America upon the death of Abraham
Lincoln. There were autograph letters from eminent foreign statesmen,
diplomats and men of note, including Robespierre, Barre, Carnot, Louis XV.,
Alexander I. of Russia, Jerome Bonaparte, Queen Victoria, Alexander III.
of Russia, William I. of Germany, President Diaz of Mexico and the King
of Siam. There were portraits of the successive secretaries of State; Andrew
Jackson's sword; a statuette of Washington, and many other historic relics
of great men.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department exhibit was placed next south of that of the
State Department, nearly 4,200 square feet of floor space being used. The
Bureau of the Mint, among other things, exhibited a coin press from the San
Francisco mint which was operated almost daily by means of electric power.
The souvenir Exposition medals were struck off by this machine, the operation being a constant source of intense interest to visitors who crowded about
the guard railing. This was a novel, live exhibit, which contributed much
to the success of the efforts of the Government's agents to attract and instruct
the people. Another bureau exhibited treasury notes of various denominations
in the shape of proof sheets illustrating the process of printing, also silver
certificates, postage and revenue stamps; frames displaying canceled United
States greenbacks and bonds; specimens of old State (wildcat) bank issues;
Confederate States notes and bonds of different denominations; postal currency
of a generation ago; a full set of coins of the United States from the foundation of the Government to the present time; a money-printing press in operation, together with many other objects suggestive of Uncle Sam's great money chest.</p>

<p>The War Department exhibit was located in the southeast corner of the
building and occupied 4, 586 square feet of floor space, being installed under
the direction of Major Henry C. Ward, Sixteenth United States Infantry, who
represented officially the War Department. Five branches of the army were
illustrated. The war with Spain broke out at a time inopportune for making
this exhibit as extensive as it was intended to be, rendering impossible a display of some pieces of ordnance which otherwise would have been shown.
Depicting the evolution of uniforms of officers and enlisted men from the
Revolutionary War down to 1808, a series of lay figures were exhibited by
the quartermaster's department, a few of which were as follows: Group of
four officers of the Revolutionary army, 1776, in full-dress uniform, representing a brigadier-general, an adjutant-general and two field officers; also group of privates of same period; a Kentucky and a Maryland rifleman in uniforms peculiar to the State militia; uniforms of officers and privates of the War of 1812; also those of the Mexican War period, 1846; those of a colonel
of cavalry, a private of infantry and a zouave of a Pennsylvania regiment,
1861-5 Civil War period; also numerous figures of officers and men of
the Spanish-American War period. There was also the figure of a Puritan
of 1620 represented as being on his way to church with a gun on his shoulder
and Bible in hand. There were large cannon of late pattern. a Maxim rapid-
firing gun, with projectiles and shells, together with a variety of infantry and cavalry equipment. An exhibit which attracted much attention was made up
of relics of the war with Spain which were added soon after the surrender of
the Spanish army and the fall of the city of Santiago de Cuba, July 17, 1898,
as follows: The first Spanish trophy secured in Cuba, a regimental Spanish

flag captured at the battle of Juragasita, Cuba, on June 23, 1898, by Company N. Twenty-second United States infantry from Fort Crook, Nebraska,
names of the men who made the capture being Corporal Nueman, Corporal
Boyle and Privates Keyser, Cooley and Houghsalling; a large Spanish flag,
taken from the converted cruiser, "Mexico," in the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba, July 17, 1898; also Mauser rifles, old muzzle-loading cannon and the
Santiago war balloon. The signal corps had an exhibit of instruments used
by it in active service, and outside of the building the corps exhibit-war and

</div>

signal balloons, military signaling and field telephone and telegraph apparatus. Signaling by balloons, flags and heliographs was given practical demonstration when weather permitted. In the main exhibit there were relics of the Greely Arctic expedition.</p>

<p>The navy department exhibit was in the northeast corner of the building.
The chief feature was a display of models of warships, torpedo boats cruisers,
battleships, etc., including and original model of the "Maine," which drew
large crowds. There were models of perhaps a dozen modern war vessels of
the navy, also models of the "Petrel," "Yorktown," "Katahdin," "Kearsarge," and half models of the "Constitution," the "Hartford," the "Independence"

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.154.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.154.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.154.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

and the "Ohio." There was also a full-size model of one of the military masts
of war vessels with its rapid-firing guns and searchlight. The model of the
battleship "Illinois" was used to illustrate a vessel in dry dock. The Bureau
of Ordnance was represented by a 13-inch gun, a 6-pounder Hotchkiss, and
other guns and mortars with shot and shells. There were anchors and signal
flags. A most interesting exhibit was that of the Franklin life-buoy, an
invention of the greatest value. A small rod is attached to each side of
the buoy, the base of which contains a chemical solution that ignites at contact with the water. When the buoy is thrown overboard the chemical bursts into a continuous flame and the man overboard is able to locate it at once, no matter how high the sea may be rolling. The rods are held under water by their
own weight, except one end which emits a cloud of smoke by day and becomes
luminous at night. The "range-finder" was an exhibit which excited much
curiosity. It is an invention of a United States naval officer. and its workings are unknown outside of our navy. With it a gunner quickly gets the range of the enemy's ships.</p>

<p>The exhibit of the Department of justice adjoined that of the navy, being
largely in the nature of pictures of celebrated judges and attorneys-general;
rare copies of legal books and blank forms giving an idea of the manner in
which the business of the department is transacted; there were articles illustrating the prison system of the Federal Government. and many interesting
manuscripts of a technical nature.</p>

<p>On the west side of the building, just north of the center, over 3,400
square feet of floor space was devoted to the exhibit of the pos-office department. There was a complete series of postage stamps with sets of foreign
stamps. There were models of uniformed carriers, of mail steamers, of post-office cars, including the Helena and Bozeman stage coach of pioneer days.
and a figure of an Indian mail carrier with three dogs hitched to his mail
sledge. The dead-letter-division exhibit attracted attention and there were
engravings, portraits and photographs illustrating the history and growth of
the postal service. The stamp division exhibit was highly valuable and instructive, containing samples of postage stamps of successive issues since their
introduction in 1847, down to the special issue commemorative of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition of 1808.</p>

<p>This special issue was regarded as one of the most important acts incident
to government participation. The stamps were issued in denominations as
follows: 1-cent, 2-cent, 4-cent, 5-cent, 8-cent, 10-cent, 50-cent, $1 and $2.
They were larger than ordinary postage stamps, being about seven-eights
of an inch in width by one and three-eighths inches long. The designs were
unique, made up largely of a steel engraving of a scene indicative in some
degree of the development of the great region between the Great Lakes and the
Rocky Mountains. The border, which formed in its inner line an irregular

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.155.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.155.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.155.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

oval framework to each of the scenes illustrated, consisted of a fluted figure
on either side, with interior crossbars, beginning in a single line near the
bottom of the stamp and enlarging it until it reached a shield in each of the
upper corners wherein was engraved in white the Arabic numeral indicating
the denomination of the stamp, the dollar marks being included in the two
stamps of highest value. At the top, connecting the two shields and united to
the fluted framework on the two sides, was a curved tablet on which was
engraved in small, white capitals, the words, "United States of America."
Above this, on either side, were heads of wheat and between these was a small
scroll. Below the engraving was the title of the picture in small, white Gothic
letters on a curved tablet, and below this, on either side in scrolls, were the
words indicating the value of the stamp. Above each of these was a projecting ear of corn, and. at the bottom of all on a straight black tablet were the
words, "Postage, one cent." etc., in white capitals. The titles of the engraved
pictures are as follows:</p>

<p>One-cent stamp—"Marquette on the Mississippi," from a painting by Lamprecht, now in possession of Marquette College, Milwaukee, Wis., representing Father Marquette in a boat on the Upper Mississippi, preaching to the Indians. Color, dark green.</p>

<p>Two-cent stamp—"Farming in the West," from a photograph representing a western grain field with a long row of plows at work. Color, copper red.</p>

<p>Four-cent stamp—"Indian Hunting Buffalo," reproduction of an
engraving in schoolcraft; history of the Indian Tribes." Color, orange.</p>

<p>Five-cent stamp—"Fremont in Rocky Mountains," modified from a wood
engraving representing the Pathfinder planting the United States Hag on the
highest peak of the Rocky Mountains. Color, dark blue.</p>

<p>Eight-cent stamp—"Troops Guarding Train," representing a detachment
of United States soldiers conveying an emigrant train across the prairies: from
a drawing by Frederick Remington, permission to use which was kindly given
by the publisher, R. H. Russell of New York. Color. dark blue.</p>

<p>Ten-cent stamp—"Hardships of Emigration," from a painting (kindly
loaned by the artist, A. I. Heaton) representing an emigrant and his family
on the plains in a "prairie schooner," one of the horses having fallen from
exhaustion. Color, slate.</p>

<p>Fifty-cent stamp—"Western Mining Prospector," from a drawing by
Frederiek Remington (permission to use which was kindly given by the publisher, R. H. Russell of New York) representing a prospector with pack mules
in the mountains searching for gold. Color, olive.</p>

<p>Dollar stamp—"Western Cattle in Storm," representing a herd of cattle,
preceded by the leader, seeking safety from a gathering storm; reproduced
from a large steel engraving, having been kindly loaned by Mrs. C. D. Johnson. Color, light brown.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT EXHIBITS</p>
 
</div>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.157.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.157.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.157.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>Two-dollar stamp—"Mississippi River Bridge," from an engraving; a
representation of the great bridge over the Mississippi at St. Louis. Color,
sapphire blue.</p>

<p>The entire series of these beautiful commemorative postage stamps was
added to the collection of stamps in the exhibit, in the shape of large sheets
bearing many stamps of on e denomination just as they were taken from the
printing press. They attracted a great deal of attention. The total issue of
these commemorative Exposition stamps approximated 325,000,000, the
department issuing them to nearly every postoffice in the country. The
stamps had far-reaching influence not only in advertising the Exposition, but
in raising it in rank of importance to a plane of equality with former expositions which had enjoyed such recognition at the hands of Uncle Sam's Government. To Manager Rosewater, of the Department of Publicity and Promotion,
was chiefly due the credit for tireless efforts to induce the Government to
authorize this special issue of commemorative stamps.</p>

<p>The equipment division showed a complete collection of United States
mail bags and pouches, a collection of foreign mail bags and pouches, and by
models and otherwise contrasted old and new home and foreign postal uniforms, equipment and means of transporting the mails.</p>

<p>To the dead-letter division considerable space was devoted, and it made
an interesting display of an immense variety of documents and articles which
had failed of delivery for want of proper addresses. During the Civil War an
immense number of photographs of soldiers reached the dead letter office and
among a collection of some 3000 on exhibition with the above, Miss Gorman,
daughter of Gorman, at that time assistant superintendent of the Omaha
street railway, recognized her father, to whom it was sent on request and
proved to be a picture he had mailed home when he was at the front with the
Union army, a generation ago.</p>

<p>The mounted hide of Owney, the postal clerks' dog, was also among the
exhibits. This dog had traveled in postal cars all over the United States and
Europe, and visited China and Japan.</p>

<p>In addition to the various exhibits above mentioned, in a separate part of
the building a working postoffice was in active operation during the period of
the Exposition, through which much information was obtained by the public
with reference to the receipt, dispatch and delivery of mails.</p>

<p>The exhibit of the department of the interior was placed near the center of
the building, occupying 4067 square feet of floor space. Its many interesting
features formed a constant attraction to visitors. Five departmental bureaus
were represented—the Patent Office, the General Land Office, the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, the Geological Survey and the Bureau of Education. The
Patent Office exhibited models and completed agricultural implements, sewing

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.158.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.158.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.158.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

machines, printing machinery, typewriters, and an infinite variety of other
forms of mechanism, intended to show the progress of invention in the United
States. There were 472 original models of patents. The General Land Office,
among other things, exhibited a fac-simile of the first land patent ever issued
to a citizen of Nebraska, which embraced an area of land within which the
Exposition grounds had a place. The Bureau of Indian Affairs exhibited
specimens of work done at the Indian schools by Indian boys and girls, showing their progress in gaining a working knowledge of the arts and trades.
The Bureau of Education had an exhibit of pictures, maps and charts which
demonstrated the degree of progress made by the young Indians along educational lines. The work of the Indian reservation schools was graphically illustrated.</p>

<p>The Geological Survey made a novel and highly interesting display of
minerals, topographical maps, etc. There were rare geological specimens and
illuminated photographic transparencies showing scenes in Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>The exhibit of the department of agriculture was located in the southwest
corner of the building, covering 4716 square feet. The various bureaus were
adequately represented.</p>

<p>The weather bureau exhibited and operated automatic recording instruments and an attendant explained their workings, as well as the use and
application of the other exhibits of the bureau.</p>

<p>The division of pomology furnished information concerning the appearance and varietal characteristics of important fruits by means of models;
while a special feature of the exhibit was a collection of sun-dried and evaporated fruits of the United States illustrating the commercial grading and
packing of such fruits for market. The division of entomology exhibited in
groups such insects as attacked certain plants, confining the groups to such
plants as are found in the Trans-Mississippi country. The division of chemistry devoted its space largely to illustrating the history, processes and products
of the beet-sugar industry in the United States, with special reference to
Nebraska and States west of the Great Lakes-a territory destined to produce
more sugar than its population consumes. The bureau of animal industry
exhibited models of vats for dipping sheep, etc., and a feature of attraction
was the microscopic inspection of meat which was carried on daily by four
assistant microscopists detailed from the force of the bureau at South Omaha.
The division of botany demonstrated its work along lines of poisonous plants,
and pure-seed investigations. The division of vegetable physiology and
pathology by models, etc., illustrated the habits of growths and appearances
of the different genera and species of wild edible and poisonous mushrooms.
The division of forestry demonstrated by monograms the character, appearance, uses, etc., of trees; by models showed the devastation consequent upon

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.159.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.159.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.159.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

indiscriminate cutting of farm forest cover; and outside near the transportation and agricultural implement building made practical demonstration of
forestry on a plat of ground set apart for that purpose.</p>

<p>A prime attraction was the extraordinary exhibit of the Smithsonian
Institution and National Museum, located in the east central portion of the
Government building, covering about 4000 square feet. Although the exhibit
was an extensive one, covering a multitude of interesting things, no effort
was made to gather together an exhaustive collection of specimens, the object
sought being rather to make known the nature of the work carried on at
Washington. The Smithsonian Institution proper was comprised in large
part of pictures of the various secretaries of the Institution, medals, a cast of
the bronze tablet which a short time before had been placed on the tomb of
Smithson in Genoa, Italy; and in addition, for the first time was exhibited a
photographic copy of the will of James Smithson, the generous Englishman
to whom America is indebted for the famous institution. The Government had
only recently secured this valuable memento, and the exhibit proved quite an
acquisition to the collection.</p>

<p>The National Museum exhibit was an extensive one and intended to 
illustrate the leading facts of human effort and progress, which was accomplished by means of a series of articles and figures enclosed in glass cases.
Among the subjects treated in these several groups of articles may be mentioned: tire-making and illumination; tools of general use; weapons; domestic
art; the books; musical instruments; transportation, land and marine; electricity; while groups of figures in an interesting way illustrated the practice of
primitive arts, such as drilling, skin dressing, pottery, metal working and
weaving.</p>

<p>The division of biology displayed in a number of glass cases an interesting
collection of mollusks, insects, fishes, reptiles, birds, etc. There were specimens of characteristic animals of the salt and fresh waters of North America,
from the invertebrates to the highest type of birds and mammals. In like
manner the divisions of geology and mineralogy made their exhibits of
geological formation and various minerals.</p>

<p>The exhibit of fish and fisheries was perhaps the most interesting to a
larger number of visitors of any other display made by the Government. To
it 5142 square feet of floor space were allotted in the northeast corner of the
building, of which 4000 square feet were occupied by an aquarium, which was
a grotto-like structure 140 feet long by 26 feet wide. In each of the rotundas
were large oval pools (25 in all) illuminated from below by electric lights.
The methods employed in fish cultural work were practically demonstrated by
the hatching in regulation troughs of rainbow and black-spotted trout, and
grayling eggs. The process of taking eggs was represented by a lay figure

of a spawn-taker with Quinnat salmon in his hands in the act of stripping the
eggs. The work of distribution was illustrated by photographs, drawings,
and a working model of the Commissioner's car then recently constructed.
The scientific functions and work of the commission were set forth by models
and photographs of the exploring vessels "Albatross" and "Fish Hawk," by
an assortment of dredges, nets, deep-sea sounding apparatus used. in making
collections in fresh and salt water, and other exhibits. Owing to the excessive
summer heat, the live salt-water fish exhibit was not a success, and during
August was abandoned, fresh-water fish being substituted. There were two
large pools in the center of the building devoted to gold fish and other water
pets; also an interesting collection of models of vessels, appliances and apparatus for deep-sea sounding, along with the sponges, corals and deep-sea animals.</p>

<p>The life-saving service was represented by a crew of eight men. The
exhibit occupied a separate building, and daily demonstrations were given
in the lagoon of the manner in which rescues of drowning men were effected
in cases of shipwreck. This exhibit proved to be one of the greatest attractions
on the grounds. It was prepared by Lieut. McLellan, who arranged the
drills for the crew. The coast survey and marine hospital was represented,
and the light-house bureau had a highly interesting exhibit, including a revolving light 35 feet in height, weighing 14 tons, flashing every 10 seconds. There were models of light-house appliances.</p>

<p>The Government building and exhibit in some respects formed the
greatest attraction on the Exposition grounds. The several departments were
in charge of experienced and capable men, as follows: State department, Col.
Wm. H. Michael; treasury department, Mr. Charles E. Kemper; war
department, Major Henry C. Ward; department of justice, Hon. Frank
Strong; post-office department, Hon. John B. Brownlow; navy department,
Lieut.-Commander Edward M. Stedman; interior department, Hon. F. W.
Clare; department of agriculture, Mr. Joseph H. Brigham; Smithsonian
Institution and National Museum, Mr. Frederick W. True; fish and fisheries,
Mr. W. de C. Ravenel.</p>

<p>THE SOUVENIR COINS AND MEDALS</p>

<p>When the plans for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition were in their
infancy the question of a souvenir medal was broached and a most unique
design was selected. It will be remembered that when the Cleopatra Needle
(tall stone shaft) was transported from Egypt to America it was decided .
to strike off a medal in commemoration of the event. The profile of Cleopatra
was desired for one side, but no perfect profile could be found. Commander
Goringe, the engineer who transported the Needle, gathered a large number
of the mutilated Egyptian coins and had photographs made of a sufficient

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.161.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.161.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.161.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

number to secure a complete profile. It was then easy to make a die for the
medal and commemorate the removal of the great obelisk.</p>

<p>The idea of composite photography was utilized in making the souvenir
coins or medals of the Exposition. A corps of competent judges was appointed
in each of the Trans-Mississippi States. They selected from the beautiful
women within their several States two of the fairest, and photographs of these
were sent to headquarters at Omaha. From here they were forwarded to an
eminent artist in New York City, who made a composite picture of the forty-four beauties. The result, which ornamented one side of the souvenir coin,
aptly illustrated the best and strongest type of Western womanhood. On the
obverse side of the medal appeared an Indian in the act of spearing a buffalo.
Riding his pony at full speed, he thrusts the blade into the beast. The two
illustrations were indicative of the strides civilization and culture had made
in the West in fifty years—1848-1898.</p>

<p>In addition to the souvenir medals, of which a large quantity was furnished, the Government had a number of gold, bronze and silver medals struck
off as awards to exhibitors under the rules adopted by the Exposition management and printed on the back of each blank application that was sent out to the
prospective exhibitors. These bore appropriate emblems and inscriptions,
also commemorative of the Exposition, and a series was issued for each of
the various departments into which the exhibits were divided.</p>

<p>The bronze medals issued to exhibitors as awards of merit were designed
by A. J. Dockarty. This design was also used for the official seal of the
corporation. The draped figure of a woman sitting in the foreground, with
products of the farm lying before her, form the center of the picture, while in
the background are seen the high factory buildings, railroad trains, mine
and smelter, with the city in the dim distance.</p>

<p>During the Exposition season, when occasion demanded, souvenir badges
of fanciful design were issued by the management, but most of the less pretentious badges and buttons were patterned after the design of the official seal.</p>

<p>STATE BUILDINGS AND EXHIBITS</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI</p>

<p>OF the States participating in the Trans-Mississippi
and International Exposition there were thirty-one, nine having their own buildings, while the others had their exhibits on display in the main buildings of
the Grand Court and other portions of the grounds. The
State buildings were all upon the bluff, or east tract, artistically
grouped about the Horticultural building, or along and facing
the shady avenues, overlooking the Grand Court to the west and
the Missouri river to the east. States represented with buildings
were: Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Kansas, Wisconsin
Montana, New York and Georgia. Other States making exhibits, but
which did not have buildings of their own, were: Wyoming, Nevada,
California, Arkansas, Alabama, Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, Indian Territory, Oregon, Colorado, Washington, Louisiana, Utah, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Generally speaking, the buildings were for rest and
comfort and for meeting places for the visitors from the respective States,
though in some of them there were special and private exhibits, made by
societies or loaned.</p>

<p>THE NEBRASKA BUILDING</p>

<p>The Exposition being held in Nebraska and in Omaha, the metropolis of
the State, naturally made the Nebraska building one of the centers of interest.
From the opening until the closing day of the Exposition it housed great
throngs of people and was visited by the millions who were on the grounds.
Funds for the construction of the building and its maintenance were appropriated by the State, the total amount being $100,000, though of course a
portion of this went to pay for gathering, installing and caring for the State
p exhibits shown in the other buildings on the grounds. At Lincoln, Neb.,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.164.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.164.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.164.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

January 13, 1897, Dudley Smith, a representative from Douglas County, introduced in the lower house of the Legislature, then in session, a bill providing for the appropriation of $350,000 to be used in the construction of a State building on the grounds, its maintenance and the gathering of samples of the resources of the State. It also provided for a commission and the fixing of the compensation of the members. On that day the bill was read. The following day it had its second reading and was referred to the Committee on Ways and

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>NEBRASKA BUILDING</p>
 
</div>

Means. From the start the bill met with considerable opposition in the Legislature. When it came up on second reading, it was made the special order for the following Tuesday. At that meeting of the Legislature, Representative
Charles Wooster, of Merrick County, who had been selected to lead the or
opposition, contended that the Exposition was intended to be purely an Omaha
affair; that the people of Nebraska were opposed to the Exposition idea, that
an Exposition would be a damage rather than a benefit to the State, because
it would exhaust the funds needed for other purposes and because in attending
it the people would spend money that they would later need for necessities;

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.165.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.165.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.165.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

that it would be a bad advertisement for the State, as it would show to the
world a disposition to waste money instead of husbanding it to pay off State
debts; that the State treasury was empty, taxes too high and property
depreciating in value; because all of the directors had refused to adopt a resolution demanded by organized labor, and lastly because it was "a scheme gotten up by and for the benefit of Omaha bankers." The contentions were combated by G. W. Wattles, President of the Exposition, and by G. M. Hitchcock, then Chief of the Bureau of Promotion, both of whom had been invited
to appear at the joint session and enlighten the members upon the scope and
purpose of the proposed Exposition. February 19 an attempt was made to
advance the bill and get it to the head of the general file, but it was defeated by a vote of 55 to 38, sixty-seven votes in the affirmative being required. Representative Windslow, of Gosper County, offered an amendment to defer further action until after the passage of the appropriation bills. This was defeated by a vote of 57 to 36. The matter hung in the balance until February 23, when, in committee of the whole, the bill came up for discussion. The original bill was read, after which Speaker Gaffin offered a substitute, cutting the appropriation from $350,000 to $200,000 and making some minor changes in the method of handling and disposing of the money. Windslow moved that the original bill and the substitute be reported back to the House with recommendations that the whole matter be indefinitely postponed. This was seconded by Jenkins, of Jefferson County, but on a vote was defeated. After an all-night session, at an early hour in the morning, the bill was amended by making the appropriation $100,000, no portion to be available until at least $250,000 had been
paid in by the Omaha stockholders, this amendment having been made by
Billings of Keya Paha County. March 5 the bill passed the House by a vote of
70 to 20, and on March 12 it got to the Senate, where Murphy, of Gage
County, offered an amendment, increasing the appropriation from $100,000 to
$150,000. At the same session Canaday, of Kearney County, offered an amendment to reduce the appropriation to $ 50,000. The following day, when the bill
came up, the Murphy and Canaday amendments were rejected and the bill
appropriating $100,000 passed by a vote of 25 to 4. It was then hurried back
to the House in order that that body might concur in some slight and unimportant amendments made by the Senate. There the bill was held for several days,
after which the amendments were concurred in, and on March 25 it was approved by Governor Silas A. Holcomb. Under the provisions of the bill
the Governor was authorized to appoint a State Board of Exposition Commissioners, one from each Congressional district. This he did, naming H. M.
Boydston, Nebraska City, first district; Martin Dunham, Omaha, second district; W, A. Poynter, Albion, third district; C. D. Casper, David City, fourth

district; W. M. Dutton, Hastings, fifth district, and William Neville, North
Platte, sixth district. May 29 the Commission met informally in Omaha and
agreed upon William Neville as president. A 

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

</div>

few days later Martin Dunham resigned and
C. A. Whitford, of Arlington, was appointed to
fill the vacancy. July 10 the Commission met
in Omaha and organized by electing William
Neville, president, and C. D. Casper, secretary.
Wednesday, July 28, the Commission held its
architects of the State to submit plans for a
Nebraska building. August 10 plans were submitted and examined, and two days later those of H. Craddock, Lincoln, and John McDonald, Omaha, working jointly, were accepted. These  plans provided for the construction of a building along the lines of the one subsequently erected on the Bluff tract, the site for which was selected August 26. The cost of the building was about $22,000, most of the work being done by day labor, only Nebraska men being employed. From an architectural point of view the Nebraska building possessed a distinctive character. It was of classic style, closely following the Ionic order, with unconventional detail. There were two grand entrances, emphasized by pediments, embellished with statuary and the great seal of the State. The dimensions were 90x145 feet.

</div>

The central dome was a striking feature, being
sixty feet in diameter, octagonal in form and
rising to a height of eighty-five feet from the
floor. Beneath this dome and occupying the
central portion of the lower floor was the great
assembly room, 60x100 feet, in the center of
which was a large fountain filled with aquatic
plants of Nebraska growth and origin. Off the
assembly room on all sides were smaller rooms,
which were used for parlors, rest rooms, offices
and for the convenience of the societies of the
State, as well as headquarters for the States
that did not have buildings of their own on
the grounds. The second story had a gallery
running entirely around under the dome and
overlooking the assembly room. On the sides of the building, in the rear
of the gallery, were fourteen large rooms for offices. Over each of the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.167.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.167.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.167.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

entrances to the building and opening from the gallery, were open balconies
for the use of the public, while above these and reached by stairways from the
main gallery, were band galleries. These stairways also led to the roof, where
a promenade was provided. At each corner of the central portion of the building were small pavilions rising from the roof. Wings extended on two sides
of the central portion of the building, each wing being forty feet in length.
The wings had flat roofs, the cornice being thirty-two feet from the ground
and surmounted by a balustrade with masts for pennants. Although not
designed as a place for exhibits, the building contained a large collective
exhibit by the Nebraska Historical Society and another most interesting
exhibit by the Daughters of the American Revolution, besides several educational exhibits, made by schools of the State. The dedicatory exercises
occurred June 14. The events of the occasion are described in another chapter.</p>

<p>MINNESOTA</p>

<p>On the Exposition grounds Minnesota reared a structure that was at once
unique and creditable to the State. It occupied a position on the Bluff tract
just to the south of the Nebraska building, and faced the west. Unlike other
buildings, the one erected by Minnesota was typical of life in the pine forests
of the North, having been constructed entirely of pine logs in their natural condition, shipped here from the pineries to the north of St. Paul and Minneapolis.
The Legislature of Minnesota failed to make an appropriation for the erection

of a building at the Exposition, but the enterprising citizens of the State, seeing the necessity of being represented, called the matter to the
attention of Governor Clough, who appointed 
the following commission: J. L. Gibbs, Geneva;
Frank H. Peavey, J. M. Anderson, E. L. Danforth, E. G. Patter, J. H. Seymour, C. W. Fields, Minneapolis; W. D. Kirk, T. L. Schurmeier,

Piervis, Crookston; John L. Bernard, Pipestone; George T. Barr, Mankato.
This commission was clothed with power to devise ways and means for
raising money and making a State exhibit. At the first meeting of the
commission John L. Gibbs was elected president; R. A. Kirk, vice-president;
W. D. Kirk, treasurer, and E. L. Danforth, secretary. It was decided
to have a State building, and the work of securing subscriptions was taken
up. With the implied understanding that the next Legislature would
reimburse them, prominent men of the State signed notes for $30,000.

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Minnesota Building</p>
 
</div>

These notes were taken by the St. Paul and Minneapolis banks, and the
question of finance was disposed of. How to build was the problem, but
Commissioner Nind came to the rescue and suggested a log house, typical
of and representing life in the forests. The idea was adopted, and McLeod
&amp; Lamoreaux, architects, of Minneapolis, were employed to work out the
plans. Everything used in the construction of the building except the hardware
and the glass was the product of Minnesota.</p>

<p>The Minnesota building was 60x70 feet, two stories high. Running
entirely around were two balconies, one at each story. They were twenty
feet wide and faced with a railing two and one-half feet high. All of the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.169.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.169.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.169.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

material was donated, the logs and lumber by the pinery and mill men and the
stone by the owners of the quarries of the State. The logs were as straight as
arrows, twelve to fourteen inches in diameter, notched at the ends, so that
when in place they lay close together. The hip roof was extended with eaves
and cornices six feet wide. On the first floor of the building there were three
large rooms. The one first entered was a large reception room, supplied with
plenty of easy chairs and settees, while upon the floor were numerous soft and
rich rugs. To the right was the parlor, a large room in which there were
many easy chairs and the other necessaries lending comfort and enjoyment.
The feature of the building was the men's room to the north. It was fitted and
furnished to represent life in a logging camp and was in striking contrast with
the other rooms on the main floor. On the north wall there was a large fireplace constructed of Mankato stone, while above and around it hung guns,
powder-horns and all of the necessaries used by hunters. Upon the walls were
skins and furs of animals of Minnesota. There were deer, moose, elk and
antelope heads, all mounted, and also the head of a large buffalo. Instead of
easy chairs, there were pine benches, rough pine tables, and in the primitive
cupboard on the wall were dishes such as the lumberman would use in serving
a bachelor meal. The main stairway to the second floor was from the reception
room. At the first landing there was a memorial window, the handiwork or
Miss Graves, of Minneapolis. The central piece was an Indian clothed in
raiment of bright colors. He appeared to be resting from the fatigue of the
chase and looking out over the surrounding country, observing the encroachments of the white men. Smaller windows at either side bore the representation of the coat-of-arms and the seal of the State. At the landing the stairs
divided and turned to the right and left, reaching the second floor, on which
was a large reception room and rooms for the officers in charge of the building. On this floor there were many easy chairs and sofas, making it an ideal
resting place. Around the balcony there were scores of porch chairs of rustic
construction, placed for the exclusive use of the guests. The building was
dedicated with appropriate exercises July 20, large delegations from Minnesota being present. The exhibits of Minnesota were in the Mines and Mining
building, the Agricultural, the Manufactures and the Dairy, the State occupying 1000 square feet of space, showing iron and copper ores, grains of all
kinds, lumber and the products of the agricultural rest, grasses, manufactured goods,
and dairy output, respectively. In the Dairy building, Minnesota made
seventy-four exhibits, the largest number of any State represented at the
Exposition. In the Apiary building the State occupied an unusual amount
of space.</p>

<p>IOWA</p>

<p>The Iowa State building was located on the west side of the Bluff tract
facing an open court and almost directly west of the Nebraska building. The
money for construction,maintenance and for making the State exhibit, $35,000,
was appropriated by the Legislature. The main part of the building was two
stories high and 56x90 feet, while on either side was an elliptical porch,
feet wide and 270 feet long. This porch, or rather the two porches,
ended in enlarged octagonal pavilions 33 feet in diameter. The roof of the
porches was supported by Corinthian columns and the style of architecture of
the building was known as composite. While Iowa had large and comprehensive exhibits in the main buildings of the Exposition, some private collections,
school work and the exhibits of societies were shown in the State building.
The main central portion of the lower floor was set aside for a reception room
and a place for the congregating of Iowa people and their friends. The offices
were to the south and the parlors to the north. On the second floor, reached
by a broad stairway, were a number of private rooms for the convenience of
the officials and their guests. There were also

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>S. H. Mallory</p>
 
</div>

a couple of rooms on this floor where the handiwork of Iowa artists was shown. The large
covered porches were supplied with easy chairs
and settees, furnishing a comfortable resting
place for Exposition visitors. On the lawns
front and on the sides of the building considerable attention was paid to flower culture. The
commission having charge of the Iowa work
was composed of S. H. Mallory, president,
Chariton; S. H. Packard, Marshalltown; John
H. Waubank, Mount Pleasant; S. D. Cook,
Davenport; I. E. E. Markley, Mason City; R. H.
Moore, Ottumwa; Allen Dawson, Des Moines;
S. H. Mallory George E. McCoid, treasurer, Logan; Owen
Lovejoy, Jefferson; A. W. Erwin, Sioux City ; F. N. Chase, secretary,
Cedar Falls. The agricultural and horticultural exhibits of Iowa were considered among the best at the Exposition and were among the largest. Being
close to Omaha, growers of grain and fruit contributed frequently and abundantly. Besides this, the members of the commission were constantly on the
alert to secure and exhibit the best products that could be found in the State.</p>

<p>Iowa was the first State to make an appropriation for the Exposition.
As early as March, 1896, its General Assembly passed a bill appropriating ten
thousand dollars, which Governor Francis M. Drake approved the following

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.171.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.171.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.171.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

month. The bill provided that the executive council of the State, consisting of
Governor Drake, Auditor C. G. McCarthy, Treasurer John Herriott and Secretary of State George L. Dobson, should appoint a commission to prepare
an Iowa exhibit as soon as the National Government recognized the enterprise.
The commission was selected soon latter Congress took action, and it met in
May 1897, at the call of the Governor, and organized as follows: ex-State
Senator S. H. Mallory, a prominent Chariton banker and railroad contractor,

Exposition at Chicago, president; Allen Dawson, editor of the Des Moines
<em class="hi">Leader</em>, vice-president; George W. McCoid, an extensive farmer and stock breeder at Logan, treasurer, and Frank N. Chase, of Cedar Falls, secretary.
Mr. Chase had been a member of the State Board of Agriculture for twenty-six
years and was the secretary of the Iowa Commission at the Columbian Exposition. He was also in charge of Iowa's agricultural display at the New
Orleans Exposition in 1884, and the next year was sent by Governor Sherman
at Iowa's representation to the "Three Americas'" Exposition at New Orleans,
At Atlanta he was the special agent of his State. To Mr. Chase the commis-

sion
 turned over the general superintendency of the agricultural, horticultural
and dairy exhibits at Omaha, but as his onerous position necessitated his entire
personal attention and allowed no time to attend the meetings of the commission, Captain John H. Merry, assistant general passenger agent for Iowa of the
Illinois Central Railway, was appointed on the commission from Mr. Chase's
district, and to him was turned over the transportation branch of the commission's work., The executive committee of the commission was composed
of Hon. S. B. Packard, formerly Governor of Louisiana; S. D. Cook, of the
Davenport <em class="hi">Republican</em>, and R. H. Moore, of the Ottumwa <em class="hi">Democrat</em>. The
remainder of the commission was appointed an auditing committee, namely:
John H. Wallbank, Mount Pleasant; E. E. Markley, Mason City; Owen
Lovejoy, Jefferson, and A. W. Erwin, Sioux City.</p>

<p>ARCHITECTS IOWA BUILDING</p>
 
</div>

<p>The commission and Secretary Chase set to work immediately to see
what could be done to give Iowa the showing due. It was felt that not much
could be accomplished with so small an appropriation as $10,000, and
an agitation was started looking to an additional appropriation by the next
Legislature. At the suggestion of the department of promotion of the Exposition, members of the Iowa commission visited Omaha in person, returning
elated over the prospects of the Exposition. They found everything far
beyond what they had been expecting, and they so reported to the executive
council. A schedule of what Iowa should have at Omaha was formulated by
the commission and submitted to the executive council, the estimates given
amounting to $57,000. It was hoped that when the next Legislature convened it would appropriate $25,000 additional at least. Among the things the
commission had in view was a fine building for the State's exclusive use,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.173.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.173.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.173.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

together with a complete exhibit of the agricultural, horticultural and dairy
resources of the State for the general buildings of the Exposition. In due
time a bill for a second appropriation of $35,000 was passed, but not until
after about one hundred members of the Legislature had visited Omaha and
had seen for themselves what was being done.</p>

<p>COUNCIL BLUFFS AND POTTAWATTAMIE COUNTY</p>

<p>In a large wigwam was placed the exhibit of Pottawattamie County. It
was eighty-three feet high and was surmounted by a thirty-foot flag-staff,
from which "Old Glory" proudly waved day and night, rain or shine, during
the Exposition. It was one hundred and eighty feet in circumference and
contained four stories, which were reached from the center of the building by
a handsome wide stairway. The windows were builtin imitation of the openings peculiar to the red man's tepee, and the entire building was covered with
heavy ducking painted to represent the skins of which the Indians of the
plains were wont to construct their abiding places. The first floor was devoted
to exhibits, the second to the fruit and horticultural display of Pottawattamie
County, the third reserved as a parlor and waiting rooms for the women and
children, and the fourth was a smoking room for the men, and from this floor,
which was plentifully supplied with windows, a magnificent view of the entire
Exposition could be obtained. The idea of the wigwam was conceived and
carried into successful execution, in spite of what appeared at first to be insurmountable obstacles, by the Council Bluffs Exposition Association. This
association was the outcome of a mass meeting held in July, 1897, in the City
Hall of Council Bluffs, for the purpose of forming an organization to arrange
for a representative exhibit of the products and resources of Pottawattamie
County at the Exposition. On August 12, 1897, the association was formed
and an executive committee of fifty representative citizens chosen by a popular
vote to carry out the purposes of the organization. The idea of Pottawattamie
County having a building of its own at the Exposition was suggested and
met with approval. To Victor E. Bender, one of the executive committee,
belongs the credit of the idea of the wigwam, or large Indian tepee, as it was
he who conceived and suggested the appropriateness of such a structure, as
Council Bluffs derived its name from the fact that it was the seat of councils
A between the Indians when they were the only inhabitants of the country little
more than half a century previous. The funds to erect the building were
secured by popular subscription, aided by a donation of $2,000 from the county
fund by the.Board of County Supervisors. In all, about three thousand
dollars were collected by subscriptions from the citizens and business men of

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.174.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.174.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.174.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Council Bluffs. In addition, about five thousand dollars were raised by
selling wigwam buttons. The officers of the Council Bluffs Exposition Association were: President, A. C. Graham; vice-president, Dr. T. H. Cleaver;
secretary, C. H. Judson; treasurer, E. W. Hart.</p>

<p>KANSAS</p>

<p>The Kansas building, directly south of the Nebraska building, was erected
at a cost of $18,000. In securing money to erect the building and make the
exhibit, three of the railroads agreed to subscribe $5,000 each. providing the
citizens of the State would subscribe ·a like sum. This offer was accepted and
gave Kansas $30,000 for exposition purposes. The site for the building was
selected April 7, work of construction commenced May 1. and on June 22
the structure was dedicated. Like all of the State buildings. except those of
Minnesota and Montana, it was covered with staff. The architectural idea
followed the old California mission style to quite an extent. The central or
main portion was two stories high, with a one-story addition to- the south.
On the east, north and west sides an arched and deeply recessed balcony was
constructed. Around the front of the balcony was an ornamental railing,
the space between this and the upper story of the main building being used for
a promenade. The size of the building, over all, was 55x57 feet. The main
room of the lower floor was 32 feet square and was used for rest, comfort and

reception purposes. Opening from this were offices, cloak and private rooms.
The walls of the assembly rooms were hung with oil paintings, showing
Kansas farm and commercial scenes. The second floor was reached by a broad

from the lower floor to the roof. Opening from this were several rooms where
exhibits were shown. They consisted chiefly of work in the public schools of

the State; maps of different counties, showing the products, yield and value.
There was also a large collective exhibit of photographs portraying life on
the Kansas farms and in the rural districts. Kansas did not attempt to
demonstrate in its own building the resources of the State, but for this purpose in the Mines and Mining building, it occupied 960 square feet; in the
Agricultural building, 720 square feet; in the Liberal Arts building 640
square feet and in the Horticultural building, 378 square feet. The commission that had charge of the interests of Kansas and was instrumental in having the State represented at Omaha consisted of: George W. Glick, president, Atchison; A. H. Grief, secretary, Pittsburgh; A. W. Smith, McPherson; John E. Frost, Topeka, and A. C. Lamb, Wellington.</p>

<p>MONTANA</p>

<p>The Montana building was a two-story plain structure, 60x75 feet, and
constructed of wood. The building was located on the west side of the Bluff
tract, just south of the main wagon gate. The contract for construction was
awarded February 27, 1898. It was completed June 10, and dedicated June
29. A small tower surmounted the northeast corner. The lower floor
was divided into offices and parlors, with a large reception room just to
the left of the entrance. The upper story was reached by a stairway leading
up from the reception room. The upper floor was cut up into offices and
sleeping rooms, which were occupied by the officials in charge. The furnishings
were all costly and in keeping with the building. In many respects the building resembled a well-appointed club house. The decorations were mostly
loaned by the millionaire mine owners of the State and consisted of magnificent paintings, mounted heads of buffalo, elk and moose, besides a number
of mounted animals, such as deer, antelope, mountain sheep and a large collection of birds of the State. The Legislature of Montana appropriated $15,000 that the State might participate in the Exposition, and Marcus

a State building, Montana occupied 2,000 square feet in the Mines and Mining
building, 1,000 square feet in the Agricultural building and 1,000 square
feet in the Liberal Arts building.</p>

<p>NEW YORK</p>

<p>The New York building occupied a location to the east of Horticulture
Hall, and was one of the most artistic of the State structures. It cost about
$15,000, the money for its erection and maintenance having been provided

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

for by contributions. It was in charge of Major Wheeler, a representative of
the State commission, which was composed of Chauncey M. Depew, John
Jacob Astor, W. Seward Webb, Henry B. Herbert, Abel E. Blackman, New
York; Charles N. Stowe, Deposit; Jacob Amos, Syracuse; John G. Graves,
Buffalo. It was dedicated October 8 upon which occasion a special train
brought prominent citizens from all over the State, members of the New
York Board of Trade, Produce Exchange and Merchants' Association. The
State building presented the appearance of a two-story center, or main portion,
but was in reality an immense room, with a balcony around the second floor
from which opened some small rooms. The wings on the sides were one
story. and contained rooms for the officers. The center room under the
dome was for reception purposes and for rest. The floor was covered with
matting and rugs. Easy chairs and couches were scattered about, giving the
whole interior a rich and restful appearance. Around three sides of the
building was a broad portico supported by Corinthian columns, while on top,
the front protected by a balustrade, was a promenade. The style of the building was of the classic order.</p>

<p>GEORGIA</p>

<p>Although there was no public appropriation of funds for Exposition
purposes, Georgia had one of the most complete and comprehensive exhibits
on the grounds. It was shown in the Georgia State building on the Bluff
tract, immediately west of the Horticulture building. Funds for the construction of the building, $10,000, and for the collection and maintenance of the

exhibit were contributed by the citizens and
corporations of the State, interest being worked
up by the commission, composed of W. J.

was of staff construction, square, two stories
high and surmounted by a dome of the Byzantine
order, adding greatly to its appearance. The
front elevation was massive, jutting out some
distance from the main structure, thus forming a deeply recessed entrance on
the first and a large covered balcony on the second floor, which was ornamented with a balustrade and large fluted columns on either side. The wings A
to the north and south of the central portion of the building set back some
six feet from the front, this space being converted into porticoes used for resting places. During the Exposition the building was in charge of W. J.
Northen, a former Governor and an old resident of the State, one of the men
who was instrumental in having Georgia represented. The lower floor of the
building was entirely taken up by the lumber, mineral and stone exhibit,
which was complete, almost every kind of known building material and
minerals being shown. On the second floor the agricultural and horticultural
resources of the State were shown. Cotton was one of the chief exhibits, it
being displayed in many and varied forms. There was the seed, the meal, oil,
cake, the growing plant in bloom and ready for the pickers; it was seen
in bales from the compress and manufactured into the coarsest and finest
cloths. Besides this, there was an extensive exhibit of fruits. both canned
and dried. There were grains, such as corn, wheat, oats, rye and barley in
the sheaf and the berry in glass jars. Fertilizers that are products of the
State were shown in profusion. The educational exhibit was extensive, giving

an idea of what the State has done in the way of educating its young people,
both white and colored. The offices of President Northen and his assistants,
located on the second floor, were always open, and the public was cordially welcomed.</p>

<p>WISCONSIN</p>

<p>The Wisconsin building was considered one of the most beautiful State
buildings on the Bluff Tract. It was erected at a cost of $15,000, the money
being raised by contributions, as the State did not make an appropriation.
The style of architecture was classic and was most pleasing. The entrance
was reached by nine broad steps, which placed the structure considerably
above the street level. The architraye of the pediment was supported by four
immense fluted Corinthian columns, which formed the main entrance. The
angles of the building were flanked on either side by pilasters of the Corinthian
order, which on the side walls were doubled. Beneath the cornice and extending along the wall between the inner pilasters, with a depth of five to six feet.
was a frescoed frieze, showing some of the more important features of the
State's history. Nearly the entire interior was embraced. in one large space
open in the center to the roof and lighted through a dome. There was a

balcony on the second floor which commanded a view of the main floor. Back
of this were several rooms for offices, where a number of private art collections were shown.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>August Uihlein</p>
 
</div>

<p>On the first or main floor, on either side of the central court, were public comfort and rest rooms. In the grand central rotunda under the dome, potted and spreading foliage plants abounded in great profusion, arranged about a fountain, which constantly threw a spray of pure, clear water over and among them. The furnishings of the room were very luxurious, a grand piano making the interior inviting and a popular place for rest and assembly. The building was dedicated June 18. The members of the commission who raised the money that made it possible for Wisconsin to be represented at the Exposition were: John C. Koch, president; Walter W. Pollock, secretary; Mrs. Caroline Bell, August Uihlein, John E. Hansen, A. C. Clas, J. A. Watrous, Ferdinand Kieckhefer, Mrs. Caroline H. Bell, W. W.

<p>ILLINOIS</p>

<p>Next to Nebraska, the appropriation of Illinois for Exposition purposes
was the largest of any of the States participating, its contribution being $45,000, of which over $5,000 remained unexpended. Illinois was one of the
first States. to become interested in the Exposition. It started early, and as
a result, its building was completed and ready for occupancy on June 1,
the opening day of the Exposition, although it was not dedicated until June
21. The building was one of the most artistic on the Bluff tract and cost,
when furnished, $22,500. The style of architecture was of the Greek and
Byzantine, the whole tending toward the Colonial, The main portion was two
stories high, 66x136 feet, crowned with a large dome or tower, the opening
in the interior extending from the floor to the roof of the dome. This dome
was supported by a number of immense columns. The main central portion
of the lower floor was a reception room, furnished with rich and costly furniture, and at all of the openings were hung fine draperies. To the south of
the reception room were large parlors, elegantly furnished. To the north were

the private offices of Colonel Hambleton, secretary of the commission, officer
in charge, and private reception and rest rooms. On the second floor were a
number of rest rooms and private rooms for the officials. In the annex and
connected by a colonnade, were exhibited the famous World's Fair pictures,
painted by John R. Key. The Legislature of Illinois in 1896-7 made an
appropriation that the State might participate in the Trans-Mississippi
Exposition and subsequently Governor John R. Tanner named a commission
as follows: James Block, Carthage; W. B. Brinton, LaSalle; Clark E. Carr,

with full power to act. October 19, 1897, the commission visited Omaha
and selected the site for the State building. Two special days were assigned
to Illinois, the first being "Illinois Day," June 21, when the State building
was dedicated, and "Chicago Day," October 1. On "Illinois Day," special
trains brought Governor Tanner, his staff and more than one thousand residents of the State. On "Chicago Day," the metropolis of Illinois was represented by more than two thousand five hundred of its citizens, including members of the Board of Trade and all of the leading clubs of the city. The State made two exhibits, occupying 60,000 square feet, over one hundred individuals, companies and firms taking part. In the live-stock exhibit, forty-two horses, forty-three cattle, forty-six hogs and fifty-eight sheep were shown. The horticultural exhibit in the Horticultural building included all varieties
of fruits in their season and attracted marked attention. Besides the State
exhibits, there were extensive displays in the Manufactures and Liberal
Arts building, by firms of Chicago and other cities.</p>

<p>COLLECTIVE EXHIBITS OF STATES</p>

<p>Not all of the States participating in the Exposition had buildings on the
grounds, yet all 111 the Trans-Mississippi region had exhibits in the main
buildings, while others that were outside and in the far east and west, the
north and the extreme south, appointed commissions, the members of which
visited Omaha officially during the summer of 1898, giving the Exposition
the stamp of their apprOVal. Arkansas did not make an appropriation, yet the
business men of Little Rock and other cities collected a very creditable exhibit
of ores, minerals, grains and woods, which were shown in the Agricultural and
Mines and Mining buildings. The work was undertaken and carried on by

<p>The exhibit of Colorado was extensive, planned, arranged for and
installed by the people of the State, working in conjunction with the commission appointed by the Governor. It occupied 2,000 feet in the Horticultural building, where fruits of all kinds were constantly on display. Colorado
sent a carload of the famous Rocky Ford melons, which were given away
under the direction of State Senator Swenck on "Melon Day." Besides this,
the State occupied a booth in the Mines and Mining building, another in the
Liberal Arts building and a block of space in the Apiary building, besides having a creditable exhibit by the Colorado public schools. The commission was
composed of Governor Alva H. Adams, president; A. F. McDonald, secretary,
Prof. Anton Ellis, Miss Grace E. Patton, E. F. Bishop, John H. Barrett,
Mrs. M. A. Shute, Charles E. Ward, Denver; C. B. Schmidt, Pueblo; Harvey
A. Lee, Ouray; Colonel E. R. Goodell, Leadville; M. L. Allison, Grand
Junction; J. B. Swan, Loveland; W. J. Bennett, Saguache County.</p>

<p>The State appropriation made by Idaho was sufficient to install and maintain some very comprehensive exhibits. The fruit display in the Horticultural
building was one of the best, while the exhibit of grain, wool and grasses in
the Agricultural building attracted much attention. The commission consisted
of: B. P. Shawhan, president, Payette; R. E. Greene, secretary, Boise; M. B.
Gwinn, Caldwell; James Hutchinson, Silver City; Edward Richards, Hailey;
George Chapin, Idaho Falls; J. H. Murname, Montpelier: P. Clough,

<p>While it was outside of the Exposition district, Florida recognized the
importance of the enterprise by having a commission. The State failed to
appropriate funds for an exhibit, yet many of the members of the commission

<p>Maryland interested itself in the Exposition and an effort was made to
secure a State appropriation, but it failed. However, the Governor appointed
a commission and the Exposition secured considerable advertising thereby.
The commission was: T. Shryock, president; John R. Carter, Charles C. Homer, A. E. Booth, Mrs- Willianq Reed, Baltimore; Harry j. Hopkins, secretary, Annapolis; Mrs. Matthew Markland, Oakland; Miss Travers C. Davis,
Miss Lillie Forwood, BelAir; Edward Abbott, John M. Carver, Jr., George
D. Dandwehn, Annapolis.</p>

<p>Although Kentucky did not make an exhibit, a commission was
named and it did much in the way of advertising the Exposition. This commission was: Mrs. John B. Castleman, Mrs. James F. Buckner, L. G. Murray,
Louisville; H. B. Hansford, Somerset; H. H. Houston, Paducah; Charles H.
Todd, Owensboro; C. N. McElroy, Bowling Green; Charles Blandford, Bowleyville; E. C. Hopper, Covington; W. R. Smith, Lexington; G. W. Welch,
Jr., Danville; P. McCartney, Flemingsburg; E. C. O'Rear, Mt. Sterling.</p>

<p>By subscription the people of Missouri raised $17,000 for Exposition if
purposes. It was not thought that this was sufficient to justify the expense of
the construction, so the entire sum was expended, under the direction of the

on the grounds. It was so complete that it won a large number of medals.
The commission in charge was made up of: F. M. Sterrett. president: H. A.

building it showed coal, iron, zinc, lead and numerous varieties of building
stone. In the Agricultural building the State exhibit attracted universal
attention, as the display of grains and grasses was extensive, covering almost
every variety of farm product. The booth was constructed of lumber from
the State, something like fifty separate and distinct kinds being used. There
was also a display of educational and women's work. The State occupied
some 10,000 square feet of space.</p>

<p>Arizona, through the work of the citizens, raised $10,000 with which to
make an exhibit. The commission appointed by the Governor consisted of:

grounds. A commission consisting of: R. M. Floyd, Eva H. Williams, Jersey
City; E. B. Goddis, Newark; H. Blackwell, Trenton; E. Barbour, Paterson, and E. C. Hazard, Shrewsbury, was appointed but was unable to raise
funds for an exhibit.</p>

<p>The exhibit from New Mexico occupied 4,000 square feet in the
center of the Mines and Mining building. There was a display of grains
and grasses and dried and canned fruits. The mineral exhibit was the chief

attraction, consisting of gold, silver and copper, besides a large quantity of turquoise, both in the rough and the cut and polished stones. Aside from this there
was an exhibit of curios dating back to the Aztec period. There was a
bronze bell of Spanish manufacture, secured from one of the early missions,

probably one of the first bells that ever came to this country. The State
made an appropriation for the exhibit, and this was increased by contributions. The make-up of the commission was: L. B. Prince, president,
S. H. Day, Santa Fe; J. T. McLaughlin, San Pedro; John Morrow, Raton;
W. S. Hopewell, Hillsboro; W. H. H. Llewellyn, Las Cruces: Leeson,

<p>The only exhibit made by.Nevada was in the Mines and Mining
building, where 1,000 square feet were occupied. A very complete exhibit
of grains, grasses, wool and agricultural products was shipped, but destroyed
by fire en route. It was then too late to gather together another and
the commission had to content itself with the showing of minerals, which
included gold and silver, platinum, onyx and a variety of stone The
Nevada commission was made up of: W. C. Grimes, St. Clair; J. F. Dangburg,
Gardnerville; George Russell, Elko; J. A. Yermington, Hawthorne; Abram

<p>North Dakota had its exhibit in the Agricultural building, occupying
10,000 square feet of space. It was made up almost entirely of the products of
the soil, consisting chiefly of wheat, oats, rye, barley, Hax and vegetables.
Some of the natural woods were shown, as also were the fruits grown in that
State. One of the striking features was a large $6,000 painting by Carl
Gutherz, entitled "Farming in the West." It was a composite picture of the
Power farm just after harvest. It showed the threshers in the held and a

number of steam plows in operation. In the distance were the farm buildings,
surrounded by groves with herds of cattle and horses in the pastures. North
Dakota raised its money mostly by contribution, though the State made an
appropriation. The commisson was: C. A. Lounsberry, president, Fargo;
C. B. Little, treasurer, Bismarck; J. B. Power, secretary, Power.</p>

<p>South Dakota occupied 10,000 square feet in the Mines and Mining, 1,000 in the Agricultural and 500 square feet in the Dairy building.
The money for making the exhibit, $25,000, was raised by the counties of the
State and by public-spirited citizens. The exhibit in the Mines and Mining
building was purely of a mineral character. A gold mine in the Black Hills
was reproduced in miniature, with all the required machinery in operation. A small house was constructed of the various kinds of building stone,
and in it were shown samples of gold, silver, mica, tin and lead. In the
Agricultural building there was a large display of the grains of the State and
also of the public schools. In the Dairy building, the State had an exhibit,
and in competition won a number of premiums. The South Dakota commission included the following prominent men of the State: A. McKinney, Lead;
W. L. Gardner, Rapid City; Harris Franklin, Martha Chapman, Charles E.
Davis, Deadwood; John Stabler, Hot Springs; Hance Murphy, Elk Point;
C. A. Jewett, Sioux Falls; O. H. Mann, Okaboji; Hugh Smith, Howard;
John Hayes, Fort Pierre; C. V. Gardner, Pierrepont.</p>

<p>Under its constitution, Texas is prohibited from making appropriations
for expositions and similar institutions. Notwithstanding this, the commercial
bodies of the cities of the State, together with private citizens, raised $25,000
and Texas was represented at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in as creditable
manner as most of the States, occupying about 5,000 square feet in the Agricultural building, where the exhibit was always a feature. Special attention was f
given to the tobacco, cotton and wool industry, while the products of the Gulf
coast were displayed in an endless profusion. Texas had by many been
regarded as a State barren of forest, yet it showed more than forty different
kinds of wood, many of the varieties being used for saw timber. Fruits of
all kinds were shown in their season and innumerable numbers of mounted
animals, birds and fishes were on exhibition. Vegetables were received each
A week, so that the display was kept fresh and attractive. At home the members
of the Texas commission kept in constant touch with Colonel Atwater, who
was the commissioner in charge, keeping him well supplied with all of the
things necessary to advertise the resources of the "Lone Star" State. This I
commission was made up of the following prominent men: S. J. T. Johnson, H, Templeton, Corsicana; Ben. A. Reisner, Tom Richardson, Houston; J. E. Elliott, D. S. Malvern, J. R. Currie, Dallas; A. N. Evans, Fort Worth;

<p>While Tennessee did not make an exhibit, the Governor named a commission and the men comprising it did much to create interest in the Exposition throughout the South. The make-up of the commission was as follows: Theodore Cooley, John j. McCann, Van L. Kirkman, John W. Morton, H. C. Ward, W. T. Davis, B. Killebrow, M. Safford, W. Allison, G. W. A Goodwin, A.

Brown, Chattanooga; S. M. Yancey, Dixon Spring; John T. Essary, state commissioner of agriculture.</p>

<p>The exhibit of Oregon occupied 6,000 square feet and the money,
$20,000, for collecting, installing and maintaining the same was raised by the
efforts of the Portland Chamber of Commerce and the citizens of the State,
aided by the commission, consisting of: J. E. Haseltine, F. Batchelder,
Portland; C. C. Beckman, Jacksonville; Henry E. Dosch, Hillsdale; J. A.

McCormack, Salem, H. B. Miller, Grant's Pass; F. B. Alley, Baker City;
J. O. Hanthorn, Astoria; George G. Gans, Salem. The exhibit was most
complete. The space occupied was divided as follows: Mines and Mining,
2,000; Forestry exhibit, 2,000; Horticultural, 1,500; Educational, 1,000;
Agricultural; 1,000; Fish, 500 square feet. In the Horticultural exhibit, notwithstanding the great distance, fresh fruits were constantly on display. In
the Forestry exhibit more than fifty kinds of woods were shown. One of
the features was a stick of timber from an Oregon fir. It was 90 feet long and
squared 4 feet. Much space was given over to grain and wool, two of the
products of the State and the source of a large revenue.</p>

<p>The Legislature of Utah appropriated $8,000 and the people contributed
$10,000 more to aid in making a display of the products of the
State. The space occupied aggregated 3,000 square feet—1,000 in the
Mines and Mining, 1,000 in the Agricultural, and 1,000 square feet in the
Manufactures' building. The exhibit in the Mines and Mining building if;
consisted of ores of all kinds, together with much of the finished products,
such as silver bars, copper, lead, asphalt, onyx and cut stone. Salt, both
raw and purified, was shown in great abundance. In the Agricultural
building Utah showed wool, grains of all kinds and the products of the
orchards, dried and canned. Silk and silk worms constituted an interesting
feature. The worms were shown on the branches of mulberry trees in the
cocoons as was the method of caring for them. Raw silk, spun and manufactured, formed a portion of the exhibit. In the Manufactures building Utah
made a most creditable display of the work being done in the State public
schools. In this building there was a large display of goods, such as cloths, all

of home manufacture. The exhibits of the State were worked up by and were
in charge of this commission: L. N. Shurtliff, president, Ogden; P. Loman,
Miss Maggie Keogh, Salt Lake; Herber Bennion, Taylorville.; T. R. Cutler,
Lehi.</p>

<p>Washington did not make a State appropriation, yet the people
by contribution raised $10,000 and filled 1,000 square feet of space
in the Mines and Mining and a like quantity in the Agricultural building. The
mining exhibit was complete, consisting of gold and silver ores, together
with some very rich copper. In the Agricultural building the space was
occupied by a display of forestry products, grains in sheaf and glass jars,
native grasses and fish. The co-mmission that had so much to do with the
work was: George W. Thompson, E. Baker, Tacoma; George B. Stetson,
P. E. Kelly, L. M. Wood, Seattle; W. S. Spillman, Pullman; C. H. Thompson,
Spokane; C. H. Clark, Spencer.</p>

<p>West Virginia failed to exhibit or display any of its resources, yet it had
a commission that thoroughly advertised the Exposition throughout the State.
It was as follows: P. W. Peterson, Wheeling; D. C. Westonhaver, Martinsburg; H. G. Bayliss, Elkins; J. S. Hyer, Suttin; J. W. Eurber, Mannington;
J. M. Camden, Parkersburg; E. Ensign, Huntington; P. W. Morris, Harrisville; Layman Steadman, Castoria; A. Preston, Lewisburg.</p>

<p>Wyoming, with its usual enterprise, made an excellent showing in the
Agricultural building, where it occupied 1,000 square feet of space. It showed
gold and/silver ores, building stone and grains and grasses. The money for
the exhibit was raised by subscription and the work was in charge of: Joseph
M. Carey, W. R. Schinitger, A. D. Kelly, L. R. Bresnahan and M. R. Johnson,
commissioners. The cost of collecting, installing and maintaining the exhibit
amounted to $15,000.</p>

<p>Wisconsin, besides having its State building, occupied 3,000 feet of
space, divided between the Agricultural, Manufactures and the Dairy buildings. The displays were typical of the agricultural States. In the Agricultural
building the display of grains and grasses was large and attractive. Factory
products were shown in the Manufactures and the dairy products in the Dairy
building.</p>

<p>Oklahoma, although an infant in the sisterhood of States, raised $2,000
by subscription, and with this sum made one of the best and most compact
exhibits in the Agricultural building, occupying 1,000 square feet of space.
It consisted of grain of all kinds, native and cultivated grasses, tobacco, cotton
and fruits. The commission was: C. Post, president, Kingfisher; S. T.
Carico, Alva; J. C. North, Northville; C. W. Points, Shawnee; M. Burke,
Perry.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITS AND BUILDING</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII</p>

<p>THE law passed by Congress providing for an appropriation and authorizing representation of the Government at the Omaha Exposition contained the usual proviso admitting foreign exhibits free of duty; but, through an oversight, did not in express terms provide for sending formal invitations to foreign governments to participate in the Exposition and urging their people to install exhibits of the products, arts and industries of the nations with which the United States Government maintained diplomatic relations. In view of this
important omission the President later was asked to issue such invitations. This was done through the State Department, all consular agents abroad being advised of such action. Thus considerable interest was aroused, and as negotiations progressed it became manifest to the managers of the Exposition that it would be necessary to erect a building especially for placing foreign exhibits. However, it was at first found to be difficult to convince officials and manufacturers of foreign States of the high character of the Exposition, due, no doubt, to the limited knowledge of the West and its resources possessed by the Government officials and people of the Old World generally. It was necessary to get all  the facts before them at the earliest practicable day.</p>

<p>The departments of Publicity, Promotion and Exhibits did much to dispel
the erroneous notions entertained abroad with respect to the character and
scope of the Exposition. The foreign newspapers, especially in Germany,
were prevailed upon to devote space to announcements concerning the Exposition, together with descriptions thereof. Agents and representatives were
appointed, the choice falling either upon native residents of the several countries, or upon American citizens who went there in the interest of the Exposition, Prof. H. Gore, of the Columbian University, was in charge of the

exhibit of the United States at the Brussels exposition, and volunteered his
services to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition Company, which were accepted,
and he was appointed as a commissioner for the Exposition. Among those
who, as commissioners, assisted in securing foreign exhibits, were the following: Colonel Charles T. Murphy, Louis Moreau, E. Lowe, Rev. Mr. Powell,
A. E. Cockerton, Dudley Smith, H. Muentefering and Geo. W. Fishbank.
Geo. Avery of Detroit was appointed associate commissioner for the Central
American republics.</p>

<p>As a result of the efforts of the Exposition management to apprise the
people in foreign lands of the character and scope of the Exposition, a large
number of manufacturers and others were well

represented. The French manufacturers organized an exposition commission comprising fifty of their number, the result of which was the installation of a splendid exhibit by seventy-five manufacturers of Paris and other French cities. The Mexican Government accepted the invitation to be represented at the Exposition. The manufactures and other products of Italy were represented by about-forty-five exhibitors, and other countries, such as Russia, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Great Britain, Canada and Germany, installed good displays of the products of their respective countries. China was officially represented at the Exposition and its exhibit in large part was contained within a building erected by the Chinese Government for the purpose. Hon. Charles Denby, United States Minister to China, was active in behalf of this exhibit, a very interesting one, and received a letter from the Tsung Li Yomen wherein he was advised that the Chinese Minister at Washington, Mr. Wu Ting Fang, would be instructed to deputize officers to represent China at the Exposition; and pursuant to such instructions, Mr. Chan Ean Moore, an officer of the Chinese Legation, was detailed as official representative of the Chinese Government. The Chinese exhibits were partially housed in pagodas, built in accordance with the architectural designs of temples in those countries. An interesting feature
was the display of ancient gods, who were presumed to preside over the
destinies of the people. There were war gods, peace gods, gods of famine
and gods of prosperity. The display of ancient and modern art as portrayed
in China was an interesting and instructive feature. Mexico occupied 3,000
square feet of space, exhibiting products of the soil: wheat, corn, rye and
barley; ten varieties of coffee, castor beans, tobacco, oranges, lemons and

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.197.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.197.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.197.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

figs; also manufactured goods, cotton, linen, silks, laces and drawn work.
Her exhibit of ores and metals was quite extensive, including gold, silver,
copper, lead, zinc and iron. In goods from fiber, were carpets, shades, hats
and coarse cloths. In one section historical articles were displayed showing 
articles and implements in use during Aztec days and prior to the invasion
of Cortez. These articles were made of bone, copper and stone. A sacrificial
stone, drawings of Aztec temples, etc., were shown. Canada, including
Toronto, Quebec and other lower provinces, occupied 5,000 square feet of
floor and 6,000 square feet of wall space. The exhibit was mainly agricultural and horticultural, showing varied resources of the country. Grains
in both sheaf and berry were shown, including wheat, oats, rye, barley and
flax, besides the grasses, both tame and wild. There was an display of fruit,
apples, crabs, plums and berries. The forestry exhibit was very extensive,
something like fifty varieties of native woods being shown. Nova Scotia and
Ontario occupied the same section. The former had a large display of fish
and food products from the sea in addition to its fruit exhibit which contained peaches, pears, grapes, etc. Ontario showed fruits of various kinds,
manufactured goods and all of the varieties of grain raised in the temperate.
zone. The forestry exhibit was large and comprehensive, including many
varieties of woods from the northern forests. From the coast section of British
Columbia, there was a large exhibit of sea fish, dried and canned. Much
space was occupied by minerals, including gold, silver, copper, iron, building
stone and marble. Woods, both in their natural state and manufactured into
timber, and fruits, such as apples, peaches, pears and grapes, were shown.
Alberta made an extensive display of small grain and grasses, some fruit and
an exhibit of woods and coal. Great Britain, Austria and Denmark jointly
occupied 1,000 square feet of space, though their exhibits were separate. Art,
manufactured goods and jewelry constituted the major portion of the exhibit.
The art display included work of the oldest masters, down to those of the
present day. In the manufactured goods' section only the best and most
interesting articles that the countries produced were on display. Denmark
displayed a large quantity of crockery and terra cotta ware. Russia made a
small, but interesting, exhibit, showing a beautiful collection of tapestry and
wood-carving. Besides this, there was quite an extensive agricultural display,
including wheat and barley from the northern portion of the country and
from Siberia. There were goods from the forests and samples of coal and
iron ore from the Siberian mines. There was also a small but select exhibit
of jewelry and manufactured goods. Italy occupied 1,000 square feet with
a display of art, art-goods, marble, statuary and manufactured goods. While
shown under the sanction of the Government of the country, the exhibit was
made by private parties and art museums. It included many valuable works

of art, some of them dating back to the period when Rome was in the zenith
of its glory. Many pieces of the marble were by the famous sculptors who
lived centuries ago. France had 4,000 feet of floor space, occupied by 75
firms, companies and societies. The ceramic display was said to be one of
the best ever gathered together, containing a large number of pieces of great
beauty and value. The exhibit consisted largely of expensive manufactured goods of all classes, yet French art occupied a prominent position, a number
of costly oil paintings and pieces of statuary being exhibited. Switzerland
occupied 600 square feet of space with its display of fine arts, jewelry and
manufactured goods. The display of watches was large, including some of
the earliest manufacture. They were crude looking affairs, as large as saucers.
The art consisted of statuary and a number of paintings of the Alps, mountain and rural scenery. In the manufactured goods section, carpets, draperies and many lines of novelties were shown.</p>

<p>The unique exhibit of the Hawaiian Islands may not have been properly classified as foreign, but it was most interesting, the chief feature being
a colony of natives who occupied primitive huts used in the Islands during
the early period of civilization. Household furniture for kitchen and bedroom and costumes worn when Islanders were in savage state were shown,
and an educational exhibit showing progress of the nation was made; also
clothing and manufactured goods, fruits, grains, sugar, rice and an immense
exhibit of coffee. Rice, timber and flowering shrubs were shown in profusion.</p>

<p>The International building was located on the Twentieth street boulevard, north of the Manufactures building. The design was of Ionic order, the studied simplicity producing rich architectural effects. The main façade presented the usual stylobate, wall veil and enriched entablature. The wall A panels were marked by highly ornamented Ionic pilasters. terminated at p either end by pavilions of severe outline and treatment. Its dimensions were 100x125 feet, with 18,583 square feet of exhibit space.</p>

<p>The official letter of the State Department was addressed to United States
diplomatic officers throughout the world. The following copy of letters to
the Government of the Argentine Republic will indicate to the reader the scope
of all such letters of invitation. These letters read:</p>

<p>
I enclose several copies of a circular issued by the Secretary of the Treasury on
January 11, 1897, which hot only embodies the laws of Congress on the subject, but prescribes the regulations under which all articles imported from foreign countries for the sole purpose of exhibition at the proposed Exposition and on which duties are to be collected under the laws of the United States, shall be admitted free of the payment of duty, customs, fees or charges, except, of course, whenever any such dutiable articles may be sold or withdrawn for consumption in the United States.</p>

<p>By direction of the Board of Managers, President Wattles wrote a formal
letter of invitation to rulers of foreign nations, inviting them to participate
in the Exposition. A set form was used in composing the letter, the phraseology employed by the Department of State being followed, and the letters
were artfully indited in the handwriting of Clement Chase. Following is a
copy of the letter of invitation sent to China:</p>

<p><em class="hi">His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of China, Peking:</em></p>

<p>I have the honor to call the attention of your Imperial Majesty to the following:</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, recognized by the Congress of the
United States of America, will be held at Omaha, Nebraska, U. S. A., from June 1 until
November I in the year 1898. This exposition will particularly represent the products of
soil and mine, arts and manufactures of the states and territories west of the Mississippi River, an area comprising twenty-four states and territories, of great fertility and immense resources, with a surface of 2,720,345 square miles and a population of 16,000,000 inhabitants, but will be patronized by all the states in the Union and by the general government of the United States. By act of the Congress of the United States, articles imported from foreign countries for exhibition will be admitted duty free, under rules and regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, copy of which beg to inclose herewith, and I also inclose a copy of the act of Congress, showing the participation in the exposition of the government of the

<p>DESCRIPTION OF GENERAL EXHIBITS</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>

<p>THE ultimate aim of a great Exposition is to mark the degree of progress made in the arts and industries and to reveal to the popular eye the developed resources of the country as well as to give some idea of its undeveloped wealth. This is done largely through the medium of object lessons or exhibits from the various lines
of industry and from natures storehouses—the workshop, 
the soil, the mine. A widespread desire to apprise the world
of the advance or progress of civilization and industry in the
Western States gave rise to the idea of holding the Trans-Mississippi
and International Exposition in 1898. The attainment of the object
sought was attested by the installation of general exhibits hitherto
unmatched in many important particulars. The amazing wealth of
the Trans-Mississippi States was exploited as never before, and the
revelation thus presented proved to be of inestimable value to the people of the West.  These exhibits, for the most part, were placed in the great buildings located in the Grand Court. In another chapter these splendid structures are described. They afforded an enormous amount of space for an infinite variety of exhibits. The area of floor space approximated 5000,000 square feet; space in galleries 75,000 square feet. There were 5,119 separate exhibits and the total number of exhibitors was 1,252. Forty States and ten foreign countries were represented in the general exhibits. Each state was given 1,000 feet in the collective exhibits free of charge. Space occupied by
private exhibits in the buildings yielded $1 per square foot, and in the grounds
50 cents. The total receipts of the exhibits department were about $200,000.
Men who acted as 'judges numbered nearly one hundred, most of whom were
experts in the particular lines in which service was rendered. Commemorative
medals to the number of 464 were awarded, with 2,530 go diplomas. In addition,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.204.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.204.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.204.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

cash prizes amounting to $35,000 were awarded to winners in the live-stock
department. The medals were of gold, silver and bronze.</p>

<p>LIVE EXHIBITS</p>

<p>The term "live" exhibits is intended to describe exhibits shown in
motion, as if in actual use. In the Transportation building, the Baldwin
locomotives stood with their great drive wheels revolving. The windmills of
a local firm continually revolved. Threshers and other farm implements
moved as if actually at work, and the wheels of horseless carriages and
bicycles spun constantly.</p>

<p>In the Electricity and Machinery building, the General Electric Company
exhibited the latest electrical illuminations. A saw manufacturing company
made its saws "go round," and a lens maker ground lenses. A gas engine
works had a sample line of machines constantly performing their functions,
and a self-lifting elevator med up and down with its passengers. A gas
engine company demonstrated the facility with which power was transmitted from its connections with a gas main. An electric company exhibited X-rays, and the Winchester Arms Company illustrated the modern methods of utilizing rifles, shotguns and ammunition. There were looms
in operation and a miniature train of cars attracted attention.</p>

<p>In the Liberal Arts building a graphophone. produced songs, music and
speeches. A concern also illustrated the processes incident to amateur
photography. An incubator hatched little chicks at another point and a Swedish firm turned out fine embroidery from its embroidery machine. Perhaps
no exhibit in the Liberal Arts building exceeded in novelty: that of a firm
engaged in making artificial limbs. A legless man rode a bicycle, performed
feats on roller skates and in other ways proved to the observer the perfection
reached by the makers of these articles.</p>

<p>The Manufactures building was alive with machines producing results.
Sewing machines turned out ready-made clothing. A Wisconsin genius
made twine from prairie grass. A packing house exhibited a revolving
refrigerator of mammoth proportions and a harness and saddlery firm manufactured saddles and harness every day. A yeast company illustrated the process of bread-leavening.</p>

<p>In the Agricultural building the Nebraska Millers' Association had an
expert demonstrating the extra quality of bread and pastry made from
Nebraska flour. Manufacturers of food products made and distributed their
goods. Tobacco growers and manufacturers were actively at work and the
processes which convert fibre into twine and rope were all illustrated.</p>

<p>On the Bluff tract, a leading tobacco firm conducted a tobacco plantation,
and in its special building exhibited its processes for curing the weed and

showed immense quantities of the marketable product. A bag factory maintained a cotton field in a small enclosure adjacent to its building. An enterprising electric company had an exhibit showing how electricity can be utilized by the farmer and plowed up the turf from day to day by an application of this power in the ordinary held work. The Chinese Exhibit Association maintained a building on the Bluff tract where ivory novelties and bamboo furniture were made to order. In the Utah exhibit silkworms at work were shown. In the mining exhibit the process of panning placer dirt was illustrated. In the gallery of the Manufactures building was an exhibit of manual training in the public schools, showing finished products of school-boy skill with lathes and other tools. An irrigation company illustrated methods of irrigating farm lands in Western Nebraska and maintained a field on the North tract for that purpose in which grains and vegetables were grown.</p>

<p>THE MINING EXHIBIT</p>

<p>The mining exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition was a well-nigh
complete exposition of the economic mineral resources of every State west of
the Mississippi River. The fundamental object of these exhibits was to show
every mineral substance produced in commercial quantity, and by the character of the specimen to indicate the condition in which each useful mineral
substance is found in nature. The different processes of extracting precious
metals from the crude ore were shown. In addition to this, an effort was
made to familiarize the public with the appearances of the chief mineral,
localities; the geological conditions under which the minerals themselves
are found in each locality, and the character of the smelting and other mining
operations carried on in each State. These features were illustrated by maps
and photographs or by water colors. Utah and Montana were the only
States for which there were State appropriations for a mining display, but
by individual subscriptions, Kansas, Oregon, Minnesota, Missouri, New
Mexico, Alaska, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Washington, Oklahoma, South Dakota and California were represented by systematic collections made by State commissioners. In addition to these, the mineral resources of Texas, Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa and North Dakota were shown by exhibits obtained from individual producers in these several States. While it is impracticable to give a detailed description of the exhibit from each a
State, it may be said in general that special attention was paid rather to a
complete showing of such minerals as had proved to be of economic value.
Perhaps the greatest revelation of the extensive display was that which
illustrated the limitless resources of the West in such important materials as
clay, building stone and coal. The exhibit was not permitted to tell simply

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.206.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.206.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.206.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

a tale of the Western stores of precious metals. The coal exhibits of Kansas,
Oregon, Montana, Utah, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, and even
North Dakota, were greater than were ever made before. A convenient comparison with the coal deposits was made by one or two typical exhibits of
Eastern coals, such as the very large specimens of anthracite from Mauch
Chunk, Pa. In clay exhibits the resources of Nebraska were striking, there
being over one hundred products of bricks, tiling, terra cotta, fire brick and
other products of clay in Nebraska alone. The effort to show the production
of gold was phenomenal; there was a large store of nuggets and gold from
Alaska, one exhibit alone containing a specimen from every camp in that faraway territory. The State of Washington told a story to the effect that that
is a gold State, and Oregon taught the same lesson. This was done not only
by showing specimens from that State, but by actually bringing supplies of
placer dirt and panning it out at short intervals during the Exposition. The
process of gold extraction from refractory ores was shown quite thoroughly
in an exhibit from the Black Hills of South Dakota. A portion of the gallery
was set aside for a lecture hall for illustrations of various processes of
extracting precious metals from their ores, and conventions of mining men
were held during the Exposition. The rest of the gallery was chiefly
devoted to loan collections of minerals and exhibits from the United States
Geological Survey, and a series of metallurgical exhibits indicative of the
progress in that line since the World's Fair. This included a line showing in
the manufactures of carborundum, calcium carbide, etc., and was perhaps
the most attractive of all. The collection of the gems of the West by Mr.
George E. Kuntz, gem expert, was another striking feature.</p>

<p>There was a cross-sectional view of the largest electric furnace known,
and a large piece of artificial graphite made therein, together with useful
articles manufactured from the new form of graphite. There was a complete
collection of all varieties of crude petroleum, including specimens from a field
in Alaska. Rich telluride gold ores were shown. New deposits of onyx
from Utah attracted much attention, as did the siliceous gold ores of the
Black Hills, where gold contents of an acre can be measured with greater
accuracy than anywhere else save in South Africa. There were iron ores of
the Mesaba region in Minnesota. There was a good representation of the
free-milling gold ores of the newly discovered districts of British Columbia,
including the famous Camp McKinney region. The Omaha &amp; Grant Smelting Company displayed 48 pure silver ingots worth $40,000—one day's
product. California made by private parties an exhibit of gold medals,
nuggets and the Verd-antique of Santa Catalina Island which is described
as the result of a revival of the ancient fashion of cutting vases. bowls, etc.,
out of solid rock and polishing them to translucent thinness. New Mexico

made brilliant exhibits in turquoise in its inclosing rock, comprising some of
the rarest specimens. There were gold exhibits from many States, including
various kinds of gold-bearing rocks. Some of the States showed ton lots of
low-grade gold-bearing placer dirt and the process of panning. There were
large-size water-color reproductions of mines, smelting works, etc. The
Utah commission permitted the use for decorative purposes of a large flag
150X87 feet, made by the ladies of Utah at the time of admission to statehood.
There were also many large photographs on glass illustrating mining properties and mineral regions throughout the West. There were uncut diamonds
from Central Africa and diamonds in the original clay. Mexico and Canada
were represented by splendid exhibits of gold, silver, copper and stone.
There was an exhibit of ore from the Comstock lode of Nevada, showing
ore which produced $20,000 per ton, pure gold. In the Colorado exhibit
there was a nugget weighing 21 pounds containing 10 pounds pure gold.
There were over 6,000 specimens in the exhibit of the Centennial State. In
the New Mexican exhibit were specimens of silver, gold, iron, coal, lead and
copper, as well as topaz, turquoise, agate, rubies and garnets. Missouri
exhibited lead, zinc, nickel, iron, coal and stone. In the South Dakota exhibit
there was ore assaying $200 to the ton. There were specimens of mica,
tin, lead, copper, zinc, silver and building stone. In addition to Utah's exhibit
mentioned above there were specimens of free-milling and refractory gold ores,
huge blocks of bullion, refined gold and silver, lead and copper, as well as
soda ash, salt, sulphates, asphaltum and building stone. Oregon contributed
specimens of native copper, free-milling gold ore, mineral point, jasper, clay
and building stone. There was a fine exhibit of pure gold from the Snake
River mines. In the Montana exhibit there were two bars of solid silver
weighing 200 pounds each. There were 4,000 pounds copper ore which
assayed 72 per cent. There were gold nuggets worth $350 apiece. Washington displayed free-milling and other gold ores also silver and copper. Georgia contributed aluminum ores, building stone, marble, granite, clay, mica, graphite and asbestos. Minnesota displayed iron ores and building stone.</p>

<p>The Mines and Mining building was said to be the best ever constructed
for the purpose. It was large. strongly built and well lighted. Its dimensions were 150x400 feet. On the first floor the. available space measured
41,455 square feet. and in the gallery there were 20,205 square feet.</p>

<p>AGRICULTURE</p>

<p>Situated in the heart of a great grain-growing region, the Exposition
naturally was expected to devote large space to exhibits of the agricultural
products of the West. In the collective exhibits in the great Agriculture
building 15 States were represented and in addition thereto there were many

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.208.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.208.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.208.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

exhibits by private parties and corporations. A distinctive feature of the
interior of this building was the large use made of the various grains in a
decorative way. Corn, the chief product of the prairie States, was much in
evidence in these decorations, yet cereals of all kinds were thus employed
to good effect. Marked skill was shown in the friendly rivalry of the different
States in the graceful arrangement of the exhibits and in their unique decorations. Some of the latter took the form of liberty bells, canopies, spinning tops, Candelabra, flags, statues. cornucopias and hour-glasses in parti-colored grain; wreaths, festoons, scrolls and arabesques of wheat, barley, oats and rye. A table spread with Nebraska food-products surrounded by a family dressed in the latest style of clothing made of cornhusks and seeds was one of the finest decorative designs. A cannon with ammunition of glass balls filled with grain came from Cuba. An American flag made of corn blades was a novel feature. Pictures of Western farm life made a beautiful frieze, the
flag drapery being very effective. Oregon's forestry display was unique—a
sawed log 62 feet long, sections or trees 6 feet in diameter, others less in girth and finer in grain.</p>

<p>The Nebraska exhibit occupied a position in the middle of the lower
floor to the right of the main aisle. The pillars were decorated with grains

and grasses. From the front arch hung the great seal of the State, above
which was suspended a large horseshoe, both worked out in vari-colored seeds.
Underneath, on either side, were the figures 1867-1808. The color scheme of
the decorations partook of yellow, green and red, the Ak-Sar-Ben colors.
The arches were hung with sheaves of grain. There was a column 4 feet
in diameter and 30 feet high covered from top to bottom with corn in the
ear. Most of the counties of the State exhibited grain, grasses, vegetables,
sugar beets, etc. There were 31 kinds of timber.</p>

<p>Oregon exhibited grains, grasses and fruit, lumber, fish, oats, wheat and
timber. Texas displayed woods of all kinds, walnut, cherry, mulberry, birch,
locust, pine, hickory, ash, cypress and the Judas tree. Arkansas exhibited 58
varieties of wood. Minnesota erected a pavilion on the north aisle displaying
wheat, oats, barley, corn, rye, buckwheat, millet and timothy, most artistically
arranged. There was a pile of flour in sacks from floor to roof containing
120 varieties of flour from 400 mills. There was an exhibit of flax and
another of wool. The State Experimental Farm of North Carolina made an
exhibit of photographs, illustrating fruits, vegetables, etc., descriptive of
intensified farming. Nearly every county in Kansas was represented by exhibits

of grains, grasses and woods. Montana placed a large forestry exhibit showing mountain timber standing. A small section of a forest was shown in
which were stuffed wild animals and birds. The Oklahoma booth was decorated with cotton. Grains, grasses, vegetables and fruits were shown. Utah
exhibited silk, raw and manufactured; also an exhibit of silkworms at work.
North Dakota displayed an excellent variety of grains. The Missouri exhibit
was remarkable-showing all kinds of grain; there was displayed the native
cotton on stalk, in bulk and in bales. There was an exhibit of wool and
tobacco, forestry and grasses. Idaho displayed wheat, oats, barley, sugar beets
and vegetables. Illinois displayed an immense exhibit of grains, native woods,
etc. Wyoming showed sugar beets, grain and grasses. Wisconsin exhibited
many kinds of grain, vegetables and woods. Iowa had one of the largest
exhibits in the building, including a great variety of grains, seeds, grasses
and woods. Colorado, in addition to exhibiting grains and grasses and seeds,
showed samples of soil. In the Washington exhibit there was a large display
of lumber, both raw material and manufactured stuff. There was one log
4 feet in diameter and 90 feet long. There was a display of wheat and
other small grain.</p>

<p>The agricultural exhibit was said to be one of the greatest ever made,
illustrating the immense strides in the farming industry in the West. Dimensions of the building were 148x400 feet and 40 feet high. It contained 84,260
square feet floor space.</p>

<p>Horticultural Exhibit</p>
 
</div>

<p>HORTICULTURE</p>

<p>Competent critics expressed the opinion that the exhibit of horticulture
had never before been equaled. The interior of the great Horticulture building was beautiful beyond description. The main rotunda was roofed by an
enormous double dome, each surrounded by a circle of Corinthian pillars, forming the imposing and striking effect of an arch within an arch. From the
middle of the space below the dome arose an immense pyramid of shrubbery, splendid palms, feathery ferns and prickly cactus, carrying this foliage well
up into the dome, the whole surmounted by a stately century plant of extraordinary size. The rotunda was beautiful with a lavish display of horticulture,
forming a splendid representative exhibit. All told, there were 600 exhibitors
in the horticulture exhibit. In many places throughout the building there
were urns filled with rare flowers and huge hanging baskets of ferns and
other decorations intended to produce the appearance of semi-tropical conditions. There were pyramids of ferns, tropical plants and flowers through
and about which trickled streams of pure water. Inside of the great pyramid
was a spring of cool bubbling water, and all about it, springing from the rocks,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.212.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.212.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.212.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

were aquatic and flowering plants. There were many exhibits of fruit which
were replenished with fresh supplies frequently. The Nebraska exhibit
occupied 2,000 square feet and contained 70 varieties of apples, peaches, pears,
berries, and all other fruits in season. California's exhibit consisted of apples,
oranges, lemons, apricots, berries and wines. Late in June a carload of melons
from Texas was received, and on July 1 the melons were distributed to the
people. Missouri exhibited 30 varieties of peaches, apples, plums, cherries,
berries, etc. Iowa displayed 20 varieties of fruit. There were notable exhibits
from Oregon, Kansas, Idaho, Colorado, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, Missouri,
New Mexico, North Dakota and North Carolina. California, Nebraska, Iowa
and Missouri made extensive displays of wines and cider.</p>

<p>The Horticulture building stood on the Bluff tract. It was a structure
of great beauty. Its architectural plan is described in another chapter. It
stood in the center of park-like grounds; directly in front of it a fountain
played softly into a basin surrounded by shrubbery, and beds of shaded velvet
pansies were scattered over the grass plots. The landscape gardener worked
out his plans in the vicinity of the Horticulture building to a degree of perfection not hitherto attained.</p>

<p>The center portion of the building was 300x300 feet, with wings on east
and west 300x70 feet, 29 feet high, with center dome 110 feet in height.</p>

<p>THE ART EXHIBIT</p>

<p>The high character of the art exhibit from an artistic standpoint, no
less than its representative character, made a lasting impression upon patrons
of the Exposition. Among the 700 pictures shown were many by the greatest
artists of the earlier periods and schools. There were good examples of
Corot, Troyon, Van Marke, Pourbus, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Titian, Van
Dyke and works of most of the living artists of eminence. The aim was to
have a representative exhibit of good examples of the best painters only, and
the plan succeeded beyond the expectations of those who had the matter in
charge. The Fine Arts building was the gathering place and center for the
large number of persons interested in art and artists. There is no doubt that
the exhibit was the most potent educational feature of the Exposition. Modern examples of reproductions of famous masterpieces, the originals of
which were found to be unavailable for exhibition purposes, were gathered
here. To persons who had not had the opportunity of visiting the foreign
galleries and who desired to know something of the historic pictures, this
department was especially instructive. The catalogues were complete in biographical detail of the artists represented, and contained about forty half-tone
reproductions of pictures suitable for such process. There was an important

collection by Scotch artists and the great painting "Charles the Bold Entering
the Church at Lisle," by Boybet, from the Art Exposition at St. Louis. A
number of pictures from the Nashville Exposition were shown, and many were
loaned by art institutions. From the best collections of private citizens
creditable selections were made. Aside from the paintings there were 200
black and white drawings loaned by the Century and Scribner's magazines—
creations of the foremost painters and illustrators. George Busse loaned a
collection of reproductions of drawings of highest merit. A distinct feature
was the Copley collection of reproductions of the important mural and decorative paintings. There was a fine collection of Braune autotypes, comprising reproductions in carbon of the masterpieces. By many of these copies visitors were enabled to get a good idea of the best art of the world. One painting that attracted attention was the "Return of Spring" (nude in art by Borgereau), a life-size figure of a young woman surrounded by cupids and flowers. The picture, valued at $50,000, came into prominence years ago when hung in an art loan exhibit in Omaha. At that time a young man, Cary J. Warbington, threw a chair through the canvas, which was subsequently repaired. It now hangs in the Lininger gallery of Omaha. The group of pictures indicated
below attracted a great deal of attention:</p>

<p>In the statuary department were many fine reproductions in marble,
bronze and plaster. One wing of the building was used for the exhibition of
oil paintings, great and small, which adorned the walls. The other wing was
devoted to a display of water colors, pastels, crayons, and black-and-white

work. Each wing of the building was divided into two large and four smaller
galleries. The galleries in either building surrounded a rotunda, lighted by a
large Byzantine dome. The rotundas contained statuary.</p>

<p>The French Commissioner of the Exposition, Frederick Mayer, of Paris,
secured a special concession from the French Government, permitting a copy
of the famous statue of "Winged Victory" to be made for the Exposition.</p>

<p>"Winged Victory" is one of the most famous ancient statues. It was
unearthed in the valley of Samothrace in 1867, by a representative of the
French Government. It was in fragments and was removed to the Louvre
and put together. About. eight years later the gigantic pedestal was discovered, and this was also removed to the Louvre, where pedestal and figure
were restored to their original positions as far as possible. The pedestal represents the stony prow of a galley, below which are sea waves. The figure,
more than double life size, towers above this massive and lofty hulk. The
statue is badly mutilated. but it shows a fully draped female figure which has
alighted on the prow of a ship, sweeping down with lightning speed, the
powerful form, with rushing drapery, seeming to force a way for this imposing goddess of victory. The dainty wings of the goddess are extended, and
might and power are delineated in every line of the figure and drapery. The
figure is of Parian marble, and the exquisite nicety with which every detail
is worked out marks this as one of the most remarkable examples of the
great genius of the Hellenic sculptors ever discovered. Careful calculations
by antiquarians place the origin of this figure in the third century, B. C.</p>

<p>In the open court between the wings of the buildings at the center of a
peristyle was a fountain in the middle of a garden of flowers, while scattered
about were groups and single figures of statuary. The success of the fine arts
exhibit was due to the discriminating taste of Armand H. Griffith, superintendent. As director of the Detroit Museum of Art Mr. Griffth had knowledge of the means of getting the best pictures. He was assisted by committees whose membership was as follows:</p>

<p>Advisory Committee—Paul Charlton, chairman; C. S. Huntington, F. W.

<p>Electrical Exhibits</p>
 
</div>

<p>MACHINERY AND ELECTRICITY</p>

<p>The electricity exhibit was no less wonderful than that of the Columbian
Exposition of 1893. The intervening five years enabled the exhibitors in some
of the branches to illustrate the advancement made in the expanding science.
To that extent the Omaha exhibit surpassed the Chicago display. Latest
phases of development in the art of applying the subtle fluid were shown.
Edison, Tesla, Thompson and Squiers each was represented in some instrument
or appliance which made his name celebrated in the scientific world. Most of
the great electrical supply companies placed interesting exhibits, while the
lighting, telephone and telegraph companies made comprehensive exhibits
illustrating the progress made in those branches of the art. The mysterious
power was illustrated in stages of evolution from the primitive glass disc for
the generation of frictional electricity with its necessary adjunct, the Leyden
jar, down to the mammoth dynamo; from the old, original "Hudson" light
of 1845 down to the latest improved arc and incandescent lights. One exhibit
illustrated the formation of thunder and lightning and other mysterious
things; another showed the original Edison electric-light dynamo. There was

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.217.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.217.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.217.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

a display of dynamos ranging from 1-16 of one horsepower to 1,000 H.P.
Most interesting was an historical exhibit of the telephone from the experimental stage down to 1898; and a similar exhibit of telegraphy, from the old
Morse paper-tape recording instrument down to the multiplex. Deep-sea
electric communication was illustrated, as was an improved system of underground wiring, together with devices for controlling and measuring electricity.
Methods of application of electric heat and power were shown. The X-ray
exhibit was highly interesting.</p>

<p>The machinery exhibit was limited for the most part to machinery and
engines for the transmission of power, together with tools and appliances
required by artisan, mechanic and farmer. These were immense stationary
engines and many others ranging in size down to the diminutive dynamo;
printing presses, gasoline engines, pumps, scales, etc. Of two small steam
engines, one could have been placed inside of a small-size pistol cartridge—
a complete horizontal engine in perfect running order. Another exhibit was
a complete boiler and engine which made its own steam and would run nearly
20 minutes with 20 drops of water.</p>

<p>There was a creditable exhibit of everything in firearms, including the
larger projectiles and specimens of four-inch Harveyized-steel armor pierced
by six-pound steel projectiles.</p>

<p>There was a comprehensive exhibit of tools of all kinds.</p>

<p>The exhibits covered 14,404 square feet of floor space and 7, 500 square
feet of gallery space.</p>

<p>In the powerhouse at the north end of the Bluff tract, not far from the
north viaduct spanning Sherman Avenue, there was a massive battery of
tubular boilers capable of transforming tons of water into steam hourly. This
plant furnished the energy for the mammoth engines which transmitted
power to all parts of the grounds, and for the dynamos which generated the
electricity for illumination. This vast plant of machinery was installed as
exhibits, and was visited by hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

<p>MANUFACTURES</p>

<p>The general exhibit of manufactures was open to the world. There
were linens from Belfast, silks and carvings from the Orient, furs from the
Russias, woolens from Australia and Thibet, laces from France, cutlery from
England, toys and art goods from Germany—in fact, all the European states
were represented in the vast array of manufactured goods displayed. Articles
of domestic manufacture predominated, forming a collective exhibit of manufactures of surpassing interest and value. The exhibit booths were more
elaborate and costly than those of any other building and presented a greater
variety of design. All available space was taken and exhibits were compactly

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.218.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.218.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.218.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

placed. The display of packing-house products was elaborate, including a new
system of meat refrigeration. This embraced a huge refrigerator of octagonal
shape, 20 feet in smallest diameter, 30 feet high, with large, doubled, plateglass sides mounted on a circular track and was made to revolve slowly around its axis by a system of powerful cogs impelled by electricity. It contained all kinds of dressed meats. Another booth was constructed entirely of canned meats arranged for artistic effects. In a substantial pavilion near the center of the great building a manufacturer of chocolate gave free samples of his product. From the upper floor of this booth arranged to resemble a roof garden, orchestral concerts were given. A stove-pipe maker erected a booth entirely of planished iron. All kinds of oil were exhibited and the many
biproducts of petroleum were shown. There were large exhibits of cut glass,
silverware, jewelry, ecclesiastical art goods, embroideries, art lingerie, sewing machines; furnishings for both sexes, pure foods, leather goods, carvings and art work, footwear of all kinds, ancient and modern, from all parts of the world; soaps, perfumes, confections, etc. There were large exhibits of prepared foods. The wine-makers and brewers made fine-exhibits. A hat factory in operation attracted much attention, as did a saddle and harness factory.

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.219.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.219.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.219.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Sewing machines in operation turned out samples of work done. In the
millers' exhibit section a small mill illustrated the process of the manufacture of flour. There were several exhibits of boots and shoes, and many exhibits of small utensils used about the home. Bread and cake making was exemplified in a cooking school. The interior of a model home was shown, containing stores and household furniture. Exquisite wearing apparel and laces of great value fascinated feminine visitors. Every contrivance for the comfort
and convenience of mankind was seen in these exhibits, which contained the
finished products of the genius of inventors. To describe them all would
require far more space than can here be devoted to the subject. The diversified
interests represented and the multiplicity of ideas and tastes displayed in decorative effects produced combinations which were harmonized in a most attractive way, presenting a picture of rare beauty. The total exhibit space on the main floor was 49,669 square feet, and in the gallery 19,884 square feet, all of which was occupied. In the gallery were placed the Hawaiian and Mexican exhibits, consisting of manufactured goods and the raw material used in
making them. On this floor also were placed the educational exhibits, which
occupied 14,000 square feet of space. The east end was covered by the exhibits
of the University of Nebraska and the State Normal schools. There were
contributions from 183 high and graded schools and 322 rural schools. Out
of 90 Nebraska counties, 72 exhibited drawings, paintings and kindergarten
work. In the manual-training exhibit of the Omaha high school, machinery
in motion was shown. There were noteworthy exhibits from the Kearney
Industrial School for boys, and from the Geneva School for girls, from the
State Institute for the deaf, the State Institute for the blind, business colleges and other private schools.</p>

<p>LIBERAL ARTS</p>

<p>The exhibit of the liberal arts measured the progress and development
of taste in the useful and ornamental articles of everyday use. Distinguishing
features were attractive fabrics, embroideries, and countless articles for house
adornment; stained glass, art furniture, pianos, musical instruments, drugs,
chemicals, fine pottery, typewriters, improved educational appliances, photographic exhibits, stoneware, porcelains of elaborate finish, draperies and laces
of exquisite beauty, jewelry and bric-a-brac from all countries, furs from
all parts of the world, and many other articles of utility. A large exhibit
showed the agrarian products of the world. The fiber exhibit of the U. S.
Government was complete, showing an extensive collection of varieties of
flax and hemp from various States and foreign countries. The Puget Sound
country had a large exhibit on panels, ranging from the raw straw as harvested to bundles of flax worth $500 per ton and ready for the mills. Samples

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.220.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.220.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.220.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Emergency Hospital</p>
 
</div>

from Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa, Washington, Oregon,
Nebraska and other Western States were shown. There was an exhibit of
four cases on panels showing jute, cotton, ranlie, sisal, palmetto, cocoanut
and brush fibers from the South, Cuba, Mexico and the Philippines. An
exhibit of corn-pith cellulose, used for packing bulkheads of armored vessels,
attracted attention. The women of Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa,
Minnesota and South Dakota placed extensive exhibits of lace, needlework,
fancy embroidery, etc., in the galleries, occupying a large portion of the space.
Creditable displays were made by Columbia College and the Art Institute of
Chicago. There were several interesting and excellent exhibits made by
colored women's associations of the county. The numerous booths were 
tastefully decorated. The total space covered by exhibits aggregated 46,128
square feet.</p>

<p>TRANSPORTATION EXHIBIT</p>

<p>A building of large dimensions was erected especially for the transportation
exhibit—300x430 feet. The exhibit comprised every style of vehicle, and
illustrated the various means of transportation and appliances of modern rapid

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.221.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.221.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.221.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

transit. There was also a large exhibit of agricultural implements. Four railway tracks entered the building—1,728 feet of track, which was filled with locomotives, coaches, cars and railway appliances. There was a palatial
Pullman vestibule train through which 520,000 persons passed during the
Exposition season. There were types of early locomotives and those of
modern pattern. The old "Lincoln coach" was exhibited. It was an armor-clad coach, built in 1864 especially for President Lincoln, and used by him in making journeys during the Civil War. At his death the car was used to convey his remains to Springfield. It was exhibited by the Union Pacific Railway, and attracted wide attention. In this great exhibit there were wheeled vehicles and instruments used in many lines of industry.
Machines were exhibited by all the great manufacturing concerns of the
country. There were 151 exhibitors and the exhibits covered 59,158 square
feet.</p>

<p>DAIRY—APIARY—FINE STOCK</p>

<p>The dairy and apiary exhibits are described in the chapter on State
Exhibits. There were five separate butter exhibits in each class during June,
July, August, September and October, the total number of exhibitors being
205, and the average score 93.25. The exhibit of bee industries occupied

<p>The fine stock exhibits numbered 2,692, compared with 1,842 at the
World's Fair of 1893. Cash prizes aggregating $35,000 were awarded. This
great industry was well represented, there being exhibited many of the finest
specimens of fancy stock every shows. Judges and competitors concurred in the opinion that the exhibit, in many respects, had never been surpassed.</p>

<p>INDIAN ENCAMPMENT</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX</p>

<p>A LITTLE more than a generation prior to the opening
of the Exposition, the ground upon which it was
erected was the abiding place of a once powerful tribe
of Indians. To the northward, perhaps a mile, and at the base
of the declivity which marks a lower plane of the river bottom,
is the erstwhile site of the chief village of the Omahas or
Mahas about which there clusters many interesting traditions
of the tribal life of an Indian nation whose chieftains dominated
a wide expanse of territory for centuries prior to the advent of
the white man. Eastward of the Exposition site and halfway
down the side of the bluff from which the Bluff Tract took
its name, was Sulphur Spring, first discovered by the red man, who
pointed it out to the pioneers, explaining that its sparkling and somewhat
odoriferous perpetual fountain possessed a mystic power in the hands of
the tribal medicine man. It was regarded by the Indians as a thing of
priceless value. Among the tall trees above and below Sulphur Spring,
wandering Indians had many times set up their wigwams and located their
temporary habitations. In fact, the region round about the Exposition site
was rich in Indian lore, as the topography of the country, its sightliness and
natural beauty, made it no less inviting to the aborigine than it has ever been
to the white man.</p>

<p>For a decade prior to the Exposition year periodical literature had devoted
much space to the decadence of the American Indian. Often the prediction
was expressed that before the lapse of another generation of time a once
populous and dominant race would be almost extinct. The government,
through its scientists in the division of anthropology, had devoted itself to a
study of the vanishing race of redmen and had begun to publish large volumes
known as the annual reports of the Bureau of Ethnology. There existed in

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.226.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.226.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.226.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>A Sioux Chieftain</p>
 
</div>

the minds of well-informed men a conviction that the slow processes of time and the encroachments of a relentless western civilization were working to the ultimate extermination of the race of American Indians.</p>

<p>These considerations led to the idea of having a large congress of Indians during the Exposition season embracing representatives of every important tribe. The managers believed that such an assembly of the various types would not only afford a highly attractive spectacle. but would at the same time possess an educational value to the government as well as to the patrons of the Exposition. The Exposition management deemed it a fitting time in which to provide for an assemblage of the various tribes of Indians who would, by their equipage, dress, actions and participation in the rites and ceremonies peculiar to their race, show to the younger generation in an interesting and instructive manner the kind and character of people the early settlers had for neighbors. The Trans-Mississippi region has been the scene of many bloody conflicts waged between Indians and white men; within the same territory had been put forth the
greatest effort on the part of the Indian to withstand the encroachment of his
white brother; and lastly, it was in that section where the Indian was forced
to acknowledge for all time the superiority of the Caucasian, accept the
conditions offered, and retire peacefully, if not willingly, within the reservation provided for him. In light of these facts of history the idea of holding an Indian congress was happily conceived, and without doubt much hitherto unknown of the Indian character and customs was learned as a result of this exhibit; while the Indians themselves enjoyed fraternizing with members of the various tribes gathered together, and the ocular demonstration afforded by this unique exhibit enabled thousands of visitors to see what the government had done for the benefit and welfare of the aborigines.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.227.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.227.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.227.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The first efforts put forth to secure federal legislation looking to the
holding of an Indian congress proved futile, but finally an item was inserted
in the Indian appropriation bill, which became law July 1, 1898, appropriating
$40,000 and authorizing the holding of an Indian congress at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. The Exposition had been in operation a month,
nothing had been done toward assembling the Indians for participation in
the encampment or congress, but, despite this delay, the matter was taken hold
of with such degree of energy that the exhibit (the first of its kind) was
presented upon August 4 and proved to be a great success. The Exposition
city was fortunately located within easy reach of the large Indian reservations,
and it was not difficult to assemble many families of the Indians, most of the
tribes being represented by an aggregate number of some 500. The exhibit
occupied more than four acres of ground in the north tract. Upon July 11,
1898, the Department of the Interior detailed Captain W. A. Mercer, of the
Eighth United States Infantry, then acting agent of the Omaha and Winnebago agency, Nebraska, to install and conduct the congress of Indian tribes
at the Exposition: and on July 13, 1808, the Department granted Mr. J. R.
Wise, a clerk in the office of the commissioner of Indian affairs, leave of
absence, and appointed him as assistant manager to aid Captain Mercer at
the Exposition. Not all the

</div>

Indians expected to be
present on opening day were
on hand, but the exhibit was
an entire success, about 450
individuals taking part in
the ceremonies. The Indians
attending the congress
brought with them, as far
as possible, their cooking
utensils, their ponies, and
either their tepees or material
with which to make them;
tools and material with
which to prosecute their customary occupations, and the
articles they made were
readily disposed  of to patrons
of the Exposition. The
Wichita Indians had with
them a typical grass house.
which had been razed from 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.228.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.228.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.228.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

its site on the reservation, hauled to the railroad, go miles distant, and then
transported by rail to the Exposition grounds, where it formed an interesting
feature of the Indian settlement. In setting it up the original materials were
used, requiring the labor of several squaws for about one week. The house was
built in a substantial manner, the inside support being formed of a square
framework of stout logs, about eight inches in diameter, planted upright in the
ground, supporting cross-pieces of the same size laid in crotches at the top.
These are dome-shaped structures, and the circular form is obtained by bending
half-round timbers over the frame above mentioned, said timbers being driven
into the ground in a circular trench. To the above are then attached small
flexible poles, at regular intervals, from the ground up, being fastened with
elm bark. The structure is then covered with grass, the coating resembling
a thatched roof. Grass doors are furnished, a smoke hole is left near the
top, but a little to one side of the center, while in the middle is a fire hole with
support from which to hang a pot, Seven families lived in the grass
house, the remainder occupying several canvas tents adjoining. There was
also a grass-thatched arbor built in the same fashion, with a sweat lodge of
willow rods.</p>

<p>At the close of the Exposition the grass house was purchased for the
National Museum, and the materials shipped to Washington and set up in
the National Park.</p>

<p>The Kiowa Apache was also an interesting delegation, every man and
woman coming to the Exposition dressed in full buckskin, beautifully fringed
and beaded. They set up their canvas tepees adjoining the Wichitas, enclosing one of them with a circular wind-break of leafy willow branches, after the
manner of the winter camps of the plains Indians. Suspended from a tripod
in front of the same tepee was a genuine, old-time "buffalo shield"—the last
shield remaining in the tribe. It is now the property of the National Museum.</p>

<p>The Sioux were conspicuous by their eagle-feather war bonnets, for the
wearing of which they evinced a special fondness. Following the custom of
the plains tribes this delegation set up their tepees in the form of a circle.
many of them being very tastefully decorated. The language of this tribe
was reduced to writing many years ago, as a result of which a large proportion of the men are able to correspond with each other in their tribal language.</p>

<p>The Crow delegation proved an interesting one because of the fact that
with it was White Swan, a former scout and sole survivor of the Custer massacre, in 1876, in which notable engagement he was shot and hacked almost to
pieces and finally left for dead, but managed to save his life by covering himself with the blanket of a dead Dakota. With his hearing destroyed by
blows of the tomahawk, his hands crippled by bullets, and his whole body

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.229.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.229.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.229.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

covered with enduring scars, he was still able to tell the story in fluent sign
language. It is interesting to note that this tribe of Indians has never been
at war with the whites, but, on the contrary, often furnished a contingent of scouts for the Government service in the various Indian campaigns of that region. </p>

<p>The Omaha Indians had with the Wah-tun-num-she, a warrior 73 years
old, who recounted in an interesting manner his story of the last battle his

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

</div>

tribe had with the Sioux in Nebraska. The spot where the battle occurred is
now occupied by the city of Columbus. It was the name of their tribe which
was adopted for that of the city in which the great Trans-Mississippi Exposition was held. The word "Omaha" signifies upstream, serving to distinguish them from tribes which lived lower down the stream. Most of these
Indians now live in frame houses, but a few of them still prefer the old-time
earth lodge.</p>

<p>The Flathead delegation was a small one, and was made up of representatives from three different tribes closely allied, speaking practically the
same dialect and having the same dress and general appearance. Those who

sought to discover flat plates on these Indians were unsuccessful, as the fact
is they are "Flatheads" only in name.</p>

<p>The Sac and Fox tribes were well represented. These Indians live in
round-top wigwams, which they cover with mats of rushes, and carpet the
floors thereof with like material. Several of these wigwams were erected
upon the grounds and covered in the manner above indicated. the appearance
of which, when complete, differs in structure from the conical tepee of the
plains tribes. The Tribe weave rush into mats and do fine bead-work, as was
demonstrated by the delegation.</p>

<p>The Tonkawa delegation was a small one, but interesting from the fact
that they were on the verge of extinction; further, that so far as present
knowledge goes, they constitute a distinct linguistic stock, and are the only
existing cannibal tribe in the United States, while historically they are the
sole representatives of the Indians of the old Alamo mission, whose most
tragic incident had its parallel in the massacre that practically wiped out
their tribe, There were only 53 survivors, and they lived on land allotted
to them in eastern Oklahoma.</p>

<p>No little interest attached to the band of Apache Indians from Ft. Sill.
Okla., by reason of the fact that the famous chief, Geronimo, was of their
number, together with his able lieutenant, Nachie. Being military prisoners
they were housed in army tents, but visitors had an opportunity of seeing
them at work making baskets, canes, and beaded-work, which they readily 
disposed of.</p>

<p>The tepees of the Blackfeet Indians attracted no little attention because
of the fact that most of them were made of hides of deer or buffalo, painted
and decorated with scenes representative of the chase. The tepees of the
Assiniboines were also covered with pictures. the painting indicating some skill
in that direction on the part of the artist.</p>

<p>A reproduction in miniature of the Kiowa camp circle as it was pitched
at Medicine Lodge, Kans., in 1867, proved an interesting exhibit and was
first presented to the public in connection with the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, occupying a small space at the east end of the Indian village and being
surrounded by a fence eight feet high. The time of the gathering depicted
in miniature was June, the season of the blooming of the cottonwood tree,
and the occasion was the celebration by the Kiowas of their great animal
ceremonial which is known as the sun dance, or torture dance, this being the
last great gathering of the tribe before the signing of the treaty which placed

them with other tribes on Government reservations. The tribe, according to
the report of the Commissioners, consisted of about 1,000 people. They
were encamped in a circle about a mile in diameter, each of the 250 tepees
being set with precise exactness, facing the center of the ring and at a uniform
distance there from on either side. The miniature reproduction of this camp
is the property of the Smithsonian Institution, it having been prepared through
the efforts of Prof. James Mooney, of the United States Ethnological Bureau,
who expended thereon more or less of his time during a period of five years.
The camp, as arranged by Prof. Mooney, was 80 feet in diameter and
consisted of 80 tepees, he having selected those deemed to possess the greatest
interest from uniqueness of design and historic association. In front of each
tepee, hung on a tripod, was the shield emblematic of the family to which it
belonged. Passing in at the entrance of the circle which was on the south in
the reproduction, but always faced the east in the original encampments.
the first tepee on the left was that of the family of the man whose task it was
to provide the buffalo, the skin of which was used in the sun dance. When
the day was set for the propitiatory ceremony, he was obliged to go without
food until he had captured his animal. The office of "Buffalo man" was
hereditary and was considered the highest honor, as evidenced by the fact that
his tepee was allotted the first place in the circle. The second was the warrior
tepee. Its decorations consisted of numerous pictures representing battles in
which the famous warriors of the tribe had achieved distinction. It was
painted by the warrior himself and the occasion was one of feasting and sports.
In the miniature tepee these pictures were reproduced by one man. A little
farther around the circle was the tepee belonging to the only remaining signer
of the peace treaty. It was decorated with black and white circles. Near this
was the porcupine tepee, the property of the last chief of the tribe. Almost
opposite the entrance was the turtle tepee, made by one of the famous medicine
men of the tribe. Next to this was the home of a member of the tribe, who
claimed to understand the language of owls. One of the birds. wrapped in a
red cloth, hung to the pole before the door. Following the circle around, the
visitor passed several tepees decorated with rude pictures of water monsters,
eagles and rainbows. Then came the scalp tepee, hung with a collection of
scalp-locks taken from enemies in battle. Day and night were represented
on the opposite sides of the next, with fantastic representations of the sun and
stars. Conspicuous among the shields on the right of the entrance was one
painted with representations of rain drops, from which the name of "rain
tepee" was given to the home of the owner.</p>

<p>The Kiowa Apaches, an associated tribe of the Kiowas, were assigned to
a place in the circle adjoining the entrance on the right hand side. Their

chief. "Whiteman," occupied a tepee decorated with the arms, a bear, which
was his guardian. In front of the door stood a shaft of wood wrapped with a
beaver skin. This he carries into battle and drives into the ground to fasten
himself to the spot where he takes his stand. In the center of the circle
stood the medicine lodge built for the celebration of the dance which
called all of the members of the tribe together once a year. This was built of
cottonwood branches interwoven on 17 poles standing in a circle round the

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Ghost Dance of Cheyennes and Arapahoes</p>
 
</div>

center poles seven paces apart. Hanging to the center pole was the medicine
image, which was kept hid in a bag under strict surveillance of the priests
during the year, and only brought out at the annual June festival. It was the
head and shoulders of a man carved out of stone and grotesquely painted.
above the image hung a strip of buffalo skin cut from a point a little in front
of the ears to the tail. This was wrapped around a branch of cottonwood.
An arbor of cottonwood boughs, which formed the secret chamber of the
priests during the dance, completed the interior of the lodge. The shields.
all of which were consecrated to the sun, were arranged in rows front and
back of the lodge. All were painted yellow—the sun color—and decorated

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.234.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.234.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.234.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

according to the designs revealed in visions. Those facing the entrance were
arranged in two lines of seven and five respectively. Behind the lodge were I
nine others, hung on poles, and two on tripods painted black and white. These
stood before the tepee which was occupied by the priests in preparing the
ceremony., The dance for which these elaborate preparations were made was
a propitiatory sacrifice to the sun god or medicine image. It continued for
four days and nights, during which time those who participated in it took
neither food nor sleep. The dancers offered themselves as voluntary sacrifices.
Some painted themselves yellow, meaning that they intended to hold to the
end; others covered their bodies with white chalk, which signified that they
would dance as long as their strength would allow. In with their arms hanging
at their sides and the eagle bone whistle in their mouths, they circled around
and around the lodge, keeping their eyes fixed on the image. While the
dance is sometimes called the torture dance, there was no cutting, as the sight
of blood was abhorrent to the god in whose honor it was given. The miniature reproduction of the Kiowa circle exhibits with a minuteness of detail all
the features of the original. Each part of the exhibit, even to the whittling
of the tepee poles, was prepared by members of the Kiowa tribe. Each tepee
was made by some member of the family who occupied the original. This
was in accordance with the Indian custom, which allows no one to imitate in
any way the property of another family.</p>

<p>The Pueblos were housed in adobe or sun-dried brick buildings erected
by them with brick they had previously made on the ground in a primitive
manner.</p>

<p>Interesting ceremonies were carried out by the various Indian tribes,
notably the ghost dance of the plains tribes, the mounted horn dance of the
Wichitas and the war dance and devil dance of the Apache, the latter performed at night by firelight, a clown and other masked characters taking part.</p>

<p>Indulgence in a dog feast was one of the incidents enjoyed by the
Indian during his sojourn on the Exposition grounds. In order to be
entitled to partake of the feast an Indian must have been a warrior at some
time in his existence, and besides this he must have returned to his people
with some scalps attached to his girdle. These scalps, of course, can be those
of white people or of Indians. In looking the camp over, it was found that
there were about forty Indians who had done something to entitle them to
eat dog flesh. When a suitable dog was found the squaws skinned and cooked
it. Everybody had to take a look at the dog, and every few minutes during
the afternoon some Indian would walk up to the kettle, give the dog a turn
with a stick, and go away satisfied. When it was announced that the dog
was ready to be eaten a Blackfeet Indian mounted a dry goods box and

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.235.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.235.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.235.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

delivered a short speech commending the Indians about him and referring in a
forcible way to the many acts of bravery that they had performed, stating it
was not often so many Indians or so many different tribes got together to
eat dog flesh and for that reason the occasion should be regarded as a most
memorable one. The Indian was greeted with applause as he concluded his
speech. No second invitation was required, and immediately such Indians
as had an indisputed right to eat, gathered around the kettle and began fishing
out pieces of the animal. There was enough to go around, but none to spare,

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Sham Battle</p>
 
</div>

After the feast, those who had partaken of it formed around the kettle and
dying embers and joined in a dance. Later a dance was indulged in by all the
Indians without regard to whether they had eaten or not. The utensils,
weapons, ceremonies, customs and domestic life of the Indian were as nearly
as possible represented just as they existed when Lo was leading his former
free life in the forest or on the plains.</p>

<p>By the student such exceptional opportunities for studying the Indian
and his ways were duly appreciated and to him the matters referred to in the
foregoing were of much interest. To a large majority of the Exposition

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.236.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.236.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.236.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

visitors the feature of the Indian exhibit was the sham battle indulged in by
the red skins at stated intervals. These battles were planned in such a way
as to display the Indian's fearlessness, agility, horsemanship, etc., all of
which features were fully brought out and when the contending braves
mingled one with the other in the excitement of the fray, the spectacle took
on so realistic an appearance that the onlooker was often carried away with
the excitement of the moment. These contests were entered into with zest
on the part of the Indians, and upon the occasion of the visit to the Exposition of the President of the United States, an especially elaborate program was carried out, the Indians appearing in their very best garb and decorated with all the war paint the occasion would warrant. So enthusiastic did the Indians become in their efforts to entertain the Great Father, that it was with difficulty they were persuaded to desist from shooting at each other—and in fact, but few of them did desist short of firing the last blank cartridge which had been served to them. A retreat of the Indians was frequently a feature of the sham battles, and on such occasions the squaws would break camp and in an incredibly short space of time the tents and contents were packed on the backs of their ponies, or otherwise disposed of for movement to the rear. Another incident of these sham battles was the capture of prisoners and the burning of them at the stake. However, before any serious harm befell these prisoners the tide of battle changed and their rescue was effected. The following description of the plan of one of these battles will serve for an understanding of the general character of all: The Sioux, the Wichitas, the Kiowas and the Assiniboines came into camp with a prisoner of the Blackfeet. They tied the victim to a stake and piled brush about his feet. Round and about him the Indians danced and taunted him in anticipation of the burning. A couple of scouts were thrown out to protect the camp from the enemy. The latter located the camp of the Blackfeet, but while they were spying about it they were killed and scalped by a couple of scouts of the enemy. The latter rushed into their camp with information of the other encampment, and just as the match was applied to the brush about the feet of the victim at the stake, the Blackfeet descended upon the Sioux and swept them away. In the fight four
prisoners were taken, and the now victorious party were preparing for a
stake burning of their own. But before their arrangements were completed
the Sioux had secured reinforcements and returned to rescue their tribesmen.
A pitched battle ensued, in which men were killed and scalped and the bodies
of the dead warriors were mutilated by the women of the respective parties.</p>

<p>Among incidents of the Indian congress the following may be mentioned:
A few days after the opening of the Indian congress a son was presented to
her spouse by Mrs. Spotted Back. A remarkable coincidence is connected

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.237.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.237.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.237.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

with the birth of little Spotted Back in that, 32 years before, his mother's
people were passing through Omaha and camped for the night at Sulphur
Spring under the bluff east of the Nebraska State building. Here during the
evening the mother of little Spotted Back was born. The place is less than a
mile from where the little fellow in the Omaha camp was born.</p>

<p>An Indian brave died during the encampment and was buried. Before
being placed in the coffin his hair was carefully braided, a winding sheet of
soft blue material was laced around him, and he was dressed with fine

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Dress Parade</p>
 
</div>

leggins and moccasins. Food, water, tobacco, etc., were placed in his coffin
to furnish sustenance and comfort during his long journey to the happy hunting grounds. At the grave-side the brave's arms were freed from the shroud
and each of his friends took a parting handshake.</p>

<p>The Indians were reviewed by President McKinley during his visit to
the Exposition. Tribe by tribe passed before him, the leader of the various
tribes being introduced to him by name. First, came the women in blankets
covered with brilliant figures in red, green, yellow and blue: some were 
accompanied by toddling children and others had pappooses strapped to their
backs. Then came the warriors on foot, bedecked in gaudy costumes, and

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.238.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.238.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.238.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

finally came the horsemen. The salutations with which the Indians greeted
the President were interesting and novel. Few removed their head-gear.
The first to salute the President was Geronimo, the once dreaded chief of the
Apaches. He doffed his head-gear and a dignified smile passed over his
wrinkled features as he made obeisance. He was the only Indian who had
discarded the dress of savagery, and he appeared in scout's uniform with a
few brilliant adornments.</p>

<p>After the sham battle the Indians lined up as spectators and sent word
to the President through Captain Mercer that they had been introduced to
him, and they now wanted that he should be introduced to them. To this
request the President acceded, and, hat in hand, he started at one end of
the line and went to the other. Captain Mercer introduced him to the Indians
with "This is the President." The President bowed and passed to the next.</p>

<p>General Miles has been one of the greatest Indian fighters in the history
of the country. It was he who captured Geronimo and negotiated the terms
of surrender. During the Jubilee week General Miles and members of his
staff occupied front seats in the reserved section, and the Indians from the
camp were lined up for review. Geronimo looked up into the thousands of
faces, apparently trying to locate a familiar one. Finally he caught sight of
General Miles and looked steadily at him for perhaps a couple of minutes,
and then, dismounting from his horse, he started toward the seats. He 
brushed aside the crowd with his hands and was soon at the side of General
Miles. Mustering the best English at his command, he extended his hand
and exclaimed: "How, General, I am glad to see you." The General
reached for the extended hand, but suddenly it was withdrawn, and instantly
Geronimo clasped the white warrior in his embrace and hugged him as
affectionately as would a father who had not seen his son for years. The
embrace was returned by General Miles, and for several minutes the great
chiefs stood there, neither saying a word. The head of Geronimo dropped
over on General Miles' shoulder, and the old man appeared as contented
as a babe laying its head upon the breast of its mother. Unclasping their
arms, Geronimo grasped both of the General's hands in his and pumped them
up and down vigorously, then let them go, only to clasp them again. When the
real meaning of this greeting was understood by the audience a cheer went
up that was echoed far and near, and was taken up by the Indians and carried
to the most remote parts of the camp. After the friendly greeting between
the two men, General Miles took from the coat that he was wearing a Peace
Jubilee badge and pinned it to the blue uniform worn by Geronimo. The
old chief looked at it in a most admiring manner, and simply responded
"Good." After that both occupied chairs near together, and both seemed

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.239.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.239.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.239.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

interested in the battle that ensued. Later they held a conversation through
the medium of an Apache interpreter.</p>

<p>During the closing days of the Exposition, it was a familiar sight to
see wagons piled high with empty trunks making distribution of same among
the Indians. It was estimated that 400 trunks found their way into the Indian
congress. Every buck or squaw possessing $2.50 bought a large trunk, and
those possessing $4.00 bought very large ones. Quality did not figure. While
other Indians were busying themselves in getting their things packed up ready
for starting homeward, Geronimo turned many an honest penny by selling his
autograph and pictures, charging go cents and a dollar for each. The Sioux
were the last of the Indians to leave the Exposition grounds for home.</p>

<p>American Horse, a man who had always been a power among the Sioux
Indians, and who has always been a staunch friend of the whites, happened
to discover General Miles soon after the beginning of the battle. Dropping
his gun, he hurried into the grandstand and was soon greeting the General in
a most cordial, though not affectionate, manner. American Horse has always
been a great admirer of General Miles, and has always referred to him as the
"Great White Chief." He had not seen the General for a number of
years, and it was the great desire to see him that brought him from his home,
500 miles away.</p>

<p>CONVENTIONS AND CONGRESSES</p>

<p>CHAPTER X</p>

<p>THE manifold attractions incident to a great exposition afforded good basis for a call to moving spirits of many parties, societies, leagues, lodges, who had not yet chosen meeting places for their annual gatherings. The entire country was scoured for information leading to prospective conventions, congresses, etc., and many agencies were exerted to induce the men in control of such bodies to appoint Omaha as the meeting-place in 1898. From the very beginning of organized effort, the Department of Promotion engaged in a campaign to make Omaha pre-eminently the convention city during the months of the Exposition. This was done by enlisting the co-operation of all classes
of men in Nebraska affiliating with the various organizations or societies
P whose annual meetings for 1898 had not yet been fixed. In this work
the Commercial Club did good service in the way of the Exposition. This was done by enlisting the co-operation of all classes of men in Nebraska affiliating with the various organizations of societies whose annual meetings for 1898 had not yet been fixed. In this work the Commerical Club did good service in the way of pointing out Omaha's attractions, and giving assurance of ample hotel facilities. Obviously this campaign was most successful during 1897, and engagements were for the most part made by vote of the annual conventions that year.
The net result was that nearly one hundred conventions, congresses, national
and state gatherings of fraternal societies, etc., were secured for 1898.
A glance at the list appended will enable the reader to see that in most
cases it was possible to enlist the active aid of a few local members of
each body or society in efforts to secure the annual meetings. The more
important events are indicated as follows:</p>

<p>CONGRESSES AND BOARD OF EDUCATION</p>

<p>The management and control of the congresses of philosophic and
scientific societies, the educational features of the Exposition, as well as all
branches of woman's work were assigned to the Board of Education, composed exclusively of women. The officers of the board were as follows:
President, Mrs. Winona Sawyer, Lincoln; Vice-Presidents, Mrs. Thos. L.

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.243.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.243.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.243.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Kimball, Omaha; Mrs. Kittie L. Dutton, Hastings; Mrs. Frank Johnson,
Crete; Secretary, Mrs. Frances M. Ford, Omaha. The members of the
board were chosen from prominent cities in Nebraska and Iowa. The board
I had charge of the exhibits of public schools, kindergartens, manual training
and industrial schools, art schools, reform schools and all schools of special
instruction. The Boys' and Girls building, of beautiful design, costing nearly
$10,000, was erected by the board from funds contributed by school children
of the Trans-Mississippi States.</p>

<p>Under authority and direction of the Bureau of Education there were
sixty-four meetings of congresses and educational gatherings. some of which,
being of national importance. attracted hither many noted men and women.

The Congress Committee consisted of Mrs. Keysor, Mrs. Sawyer, Mrs. Reed,
Mrs. Feil, Mrs. Sudborough. Mrs. Towne and Mrs. Martin. There was a
committee on program and another on ways and means.</p>

<p>The congress on art held a three-days' session. The chief feature was
a series of illustrated lectures on art topics by the best-known critics and
artists in the West.</p>

<p>The congress on music was of four days' duration, and presented programs of absorbing interest, containing the names of over thirty artists and
composers. Indian music day proved to be highly attractive. Miss Alice
Fletcher, of Harvard University, and Miss Frances La Flesche, of Washington, gave results of original investigations, while a group of Omaha
Indians illustrated the addresses by native songs.</p>

<p>The last item of interest in connection with the Indian congress was a
banquet given to the Indians by Captain Mercer. For this feast he had

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.244.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.244.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.244.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

ordered a big, fat steer, two sheep, two hogs, ten bushels of potatoes, live
barrels of apples and one thousand loaves of bread. The fireplace was built
just south of the adobe house of the Pueblos. All night long the carcasses
roasted and sizzled over the embers from cords of dry hickory, and at ten
o'clock the following morning all was ready. The Indians had expressed a
wish to be alone on this occasion, saying that they wanted to eat one meal
without being gazed upon by the white people. Their wishes were respected.
The barbecue given by Captain Mercer to the Indians at the congress
undoubtedly had beneficial effect looking to the growth of a still better feeling upon the part of the Indians toward the white man. That the feast was
greatly enjoyed by the Indians goes without saying, and it was a happy

termination of an exhibit the like of which was never before seen, and the
possibility is extremely remote for a reproduction in future of an exhibit
of the kind which would in any considerable degree possess the same value
from an ethnological standpoint, or even from the standpoint of an interesting
exhibit of the Indian in his primitive condition.</p>

<p>Great difficulty was encountered in assembling the proper kind of Indians
for the exhibit, partly because they were suspicious of the objects and aims
of the white men in removing them from their reservations. However, once
they were at the Exposition and realized that they were being and would be
well treated, they became contented and happy with their lot, and entered
into the project with zest and enthusiasm, so that not only did the exhibit
become a popular one, but it became the strongest and most attractive amusement feature on the grounds.</p>

<p>The National Council of Women held a five-days' session, Mrs. May
Wright Sewall, of Indianapolis, presiding. Miss Mary Fairbrother was
local chairman.</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Congress of Woman's Clubs was largely attended.
Mrs. Belle M. Stoutenborough, of Plattsmouth, presided, the local chairman
being Mrs. Philip Potter.</p>

<p>The W. C. T. U. held one session, Mrs. S. T. Walker, of Lincoln,
presiding. Mrs. M. G. Andrews, local chairman.</p>

<p>The Mothers' Congress held a two-days' session, Mrs. Theo. Birney, of
Washington, presiding. Mrs. H. H. Heller, local chairman.</p>

<p>The Jewish Council of Women was presided over by Mrs. A. Polack.
Among other noteworthy events were: Trans-Mississippi Teachers' Convention, the Library Congress and the Congress of Charities and Corrections. In all there were 103 sessions, for which the ladies of the Omaha Woman's Club provided the meeting places.</p>

<p>The Exposition management gave all the credit for originating and
erecting the Boys' and Girls' building to the women of the Bureau of Education. School children throughout the West were induced to contribute to
the building fund, subscriptions being acknowledged by means of certificates
of artistic design—the handiwork of Miss Lydia McCague.</p>

<p>In all, 1,737 certificates were issued. The beautiful building, erected
near the east end of the lagoon, was completed June 15, and dedicated with
appropriate ceremonies July 4. The creche, conducted by Mrs. A. Moore
and five assistants, cared for over 2,000 small children while parents
viewed the Exposition. For the benefit of the creche, the international doll
collection was sent from Boston and exhibited by Miss Arabella Kimball.
There were children's entertainments, lectures on cooking, etc. George
Tilden had nominal charge of the restaurant on the gallery floor. The Girls'
and Boys' building, with its accessories, was a successful feature of the
Exposition.</p>

<p>The educational exhibits were not numerous. Frances M. Ford, Secretary of the Bureau, in her report, describes briefly exhibits from Columbia
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California
and from several business colleges. There was a collection from the Chicago
Art Institute, and exhibits of ceramics and art needlework. Large collective
a exhibits were made by State institutions and paid for out of State appropriations. About 200 awards were made.</p>

<p>TREASURER'S STATEMENT.</p>

<p>Mr. Herman Kountze, Treasurer.</p>

<p>From the detailed report of the treasurer, the following summary is taken:</p>

<span class="lg table">
<span class="l">June 26, 1899, balance on hand ............................................ $1.831.51</span>
<span class="l">Deposits since June 26, 1899 .............................................  5,144.20</span>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<span class="l">$6,975.71</span>

<span class="l">Vouchers paid since June 26, 1899 ........................................ 975.71</span>

<span class="l">Balance on hand, October 1, 1902, none.</span></span>

<p>At a meeting of the Board of Directors held May 23, 1898, it was
A decided to make an issue of negotiable bonds in the sum of $200,000, secured
by a mortgage on 50 per cent of the gate receipts, and upon all the buildings
and other property of the Exposition. The bonds and the mortgage to protect them were prepared, providing that Joseph H. Millard, president of the
Omaha National Bank; Charles W. Lyman, then president of the Commercial
National Bank, and (the late) Frank Murphy, president of Merchants'
National Bank, should be a board of trustees for the bonds. For various
reasons the bonds were never issued, and were finally destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Bureau of Coins</strong>.—In giving official recognition to the Exposition, the Government provided for the operation of a United States coin press in its building on the Exposition grounds, and this bureau had under its supervision
the matter of preparing an Exposition souvenir coin. The dies for these
coins were made at the United States mint in Philadelphia, at a cost of $400.
The reverse side of the medal was modeled after a design submitted by
Thomas R. Kimball, of Omaha, representing an Indian spearing a buffalo.
The obverse of the medal received the impress of a composite picture produced
from photographs of the most beautiful women in the Trans-Mississippi
country. About twenty-five thousand of these coins were sold at a net profit
of nearly three thousand dollars.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Music</em>.—Thomas J. Kelley was the director of this Bureau, and through it arrangements were made for the following, among other bands, to fill engagements during the Exposition period ranging from four to seven weeks: The United States Marine Band, Phinney's United States Band, the Seventh Cavalry Band of Mexico, F. N. Innes' Band, and Theodore Thomas' orchestra. The Apollo Club, of Chicago, 200 voices, also filled an engagement of two days during the month of July. These musical organizations were supplemented and supported by a finely disciplined chorus of
150 voices, maintained during the whole period of the Exposition. The
music of the Exposition cost $52,703.28; the receipts from concerts given
were $3,520.85.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Special Attractions</em>.—The principal work performed by this Bureau was in securing side attractions in the way of fireworks, which were secured from a fireworks company of Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition to the
foregoing, other attractions were secured, but at a comparatively small
expense. The total expense of the Bureau was $12,000.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF PUBLICITY AND PROMOTION</p>

<p>Up to July 9, 1897, the department of promotion was managed by G. M.
Hitchcock, whose activities are recited in another chapter. Upon the resignation of Mr. Hitchcock, his department was merged with that of publicity and
the work continued under the management of Edward Rosewater. The work
of promotion was participated in by many well-known Nebraskans. Due to
their efforts nearly one hundred conventions, congresses, national, interstate
and State gatherings of fraternal societies, etc., were induced to hold their
meetings at Omaha during 1898. At the suggestion and through the efforts of
the manager of this department, the United States Postoffice Department issued
a series of postage stamps commemorative of the Exposition, scenes, actions
and accomplishments incident and pertaining to the Trans-Mississippi region,
which stamps are described in a chapter of this work relating to the
Government buildings and exhibits.</p>

<p>The publicity work of the department was both thorough and far-reaching, it being estimated that the various great dailies, weeklies, magazines,
etc., exclusive of Omaha newspapers, published as much as sixty-five million
words concerning the Exposition. In addition to this, the department sent
out. under the superintendency of James B. Haynes, nearly a million and a
half issues of 32-page pamphlets, news letters, cuts of buildings, photographs,
bird's-eye views, framed pictures, posters, etc.</p>

<p>To the energetic work of the promoters is partly due the fact that
thirty-five States and territories appointed commissions to provide and look
after State and territorial representation at the Exposition. In this connection it should also be said that State appropriations were made amounting to
$4.38,000, and funds were raised privately to secure representation by other
States and territories to the amount of $170,000, or a grand total of $608,000.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS</p>

<p>The plan of the Executive Committee contemplated exhibit buildings of
the highest type of architecture, with a view to producing artistic effects as
well as affording adequate space for the principal exhibits; the grounds were
to be beautified by the generous planting of flowering bushes and plants, and
ample shade provided by a plenteous supply of large trees: the grounds to be

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.258.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.258.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.258.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

brilliantly lighted by electricity. With a view to carrying out this general
plan, the manager of the department, Freeman P. Kirkendall, was empowered
to arrange for the services of Messrs. Walker and Kimball, of Boston and
Omaha, respectively, as architects-in-chief; Mr. Rudolph Ulrich, of New
York, N. Y., as landscape architect, and Mr. Luther Steiringer, of New York,
N. Y., as consulting electrical engineer. A superintendent of construction,
Dion Geraldine, was employed to supervise the building operations, and upon
his resignation in October, 1897, Mr. A. C. Foster, of Omaha, was called to
the position.</p>

<p>The matter of fixing upon a suitable site was a difficult and important
one, and even after one location had been chosen by the Board of Directors,
through the efforts of Manager Kirkendall, a reconsideration of the matter was
had and the merits of another proposed site were considered, following which
the board rescinded its action, and upon March 17, 1897, adopted a site which
was made historic by the completed Exposition.</p>

<p>The first important work commenced under the direction of this department was that of the construction of the lagoon, which began April 28, 1897,
and the first contract awarded for the construction of a building was on July
1, 1897, for the Administration Arch, work thereon being under way eight
days later, or just ten and one-half months in advance of the time set for
the opening of the Exposition.</p>

<p>It was this department that assumed the responsibilities incident to the
construction of the numerous buildings erected upon the Exposition grounds,
the manager thereof having general supervision of the entire work, which
entailed an expenditure of nearly $600,000, as will appear from the list of
the buildings erected, the cost shown being exclusive of architects' fees, office
expenses and salaries, superintendence, etc.</p>

<p>The department also spent large sums of money for grading, macadamizing and laying brick walks throughout the grounds. The cost of construction work on the lagoon was $25,507. As soon as practicable after the site had been selected the landscape architect submitted plans for transforming the rough topography of a cornfield into a series of beautiful gardens, flanked by greensward and supplied with an infinite variety of foliage plants, shade trees and flowering plants in great profusion. Within the confines of the several tracts over 14,000 trees, bushes and shrubs were planted. Upward of twenty-one acres of bare ground were covered with turf, while more than 100,000 plants and flowers contributed a wealth of beauty to the floral display in the grounds. The cost off the landscape department was $127,70791.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Electrical Illuminations</em>.—At previous expositions arc lights had been used for the purpose of illuminating large areas like the Grand Court, but at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition it was decided to use incandescent lights instead, and the soundness of Superintendent H. B. Rustin's prediction that the effect would be satisfactory was fully borne out by the splendid results following their installation.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Guards</em>.—The Exposition Guards were under the direction of Commandant C. E. Llewellyn, who at one period of the Exposition had 304 names on the pay-roll. However, the average number of guards on duty was 160. A lost-and-found bureau was established at guard headquarters, which was instrumental in restoring much lost property to owners.

<em class="hi">Medical Bureau</em>.—This Bureau was in charge of E. W. Lee, M.D., as Director. The total number of cases treated during the Exposition period was 3,095. Total expenses of maintaining the hospital, $4,075.13. Average number of patients per day, 20.25. Average cost per patient, $1.31.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF EXHIBITS</p>

<p>Under the management of Edward E. Bruce and H. B. Hardt, assistant.
the plan of operation for the department of exhibits involved the formation
of ten bureaus, referred to hereafter. Receipts from the sale of exhibit space
in the buildings and grounds amounted to $200,11048, while the expenses
and costs were 50 per cent of that sum. The total space available in buildings
devoted to exposition purposes aggregated about 50,000 square feet. and was
occupied by 5,110 separate exhibitors.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Education</em>.—This exhibit, the Girls' and Boys' building, and the Congress of Women, were in the hands of a board of lady managers,
Mrs. W. P. Harford being chairman of the Executive Committee. which
operated under rules and regulations prepared by the Department of Exhibits.
approved by the Board of Directors of the Exposition. The exhibit made
by Nebraska ranged from the kindergarten class to the university, and every
institution for dependent or defective classes was represented. The educational institutions of a number of the States had exhibits, and a good showing
was made of what was being done along educational lines. Much labor was
entailed in collecting these exhibits.</p>

<p>The Girls' and Boys' building, erected at a cost of about ten thousand
dollars, largely by small subscriptions collected from school children and
others, attracted considerable attention on the grounds. A creche was maintained within the structure, in which upward of two thousand children were
cared for while their parents viewed the Exposition. The operation of this
building was so successful that the revenues exceeded the expenses by $937.82.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Fine Arts</em>.—This exhibit was in charge of Armand H. Griffith as Superintendent. It contained many valuable paintings, and besides the seven hundred or more pictures which adorned the walls several hundreds of drawings were displayed, many of which possessed great merit and attracted considerable attention, as did the statuary. This fine exhibit is described in another chapter.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Agriculture, Horticulture, Forestry and Irrigation</em>.—These exhibits were both numerous and interesting. The decorative scheme was well executed, and the exhibit as a whole was highly instructive, and greatly appreciated by the hundreds of thousands of people who viewed it. Mr. F. W. Taylor was in charge as Superintendent.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.261.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.261.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.261.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Mines and Mining</em>.—David T. Day, Superintendent. The aim and object of this exhibit was to illustrate the mineral wealth within the entire region west of the Mississippi river, and by exhibits from States farther east to show the principal achievements in mining and metallurgy attained since the Columbian Exposition at Chicago. Many of the exhibits were in line with this plan, being both instructive and comprehensive.</p>

<p><em class="hi">The Bureau of Live Stock, Dairy Products and Poultry</em>.—This Bureau was in charge of John B. Dinsmore, Superintendent, and three assistants:</p>

<p><em class="hi">Live Stock</em>.—C. H. Elmendorf, assistant superintendent. In the procuring of this exhibit considerable work and expense were involved. The exhibit was quite satisfactory and premiums aggregating $35,000 were distributed to successful exhibitors in the live stock and poultry departments.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Dairy Products</em>.—S. C. Bassett, Assistant Superintendent. There were two hundred and five exhibitors of dairy products, the display being of much interest. The exhibit of cheese was not as extensive as could have been wished and the quality was somewhat lacking for an occasion of the kind.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Poultry</em>.—J. Llewellyn, Assistant Superintendent. The poultry exhibit was not an extensive one, although the birds exhibited possessed great merit, and to that extent the display was satisfactory. The failure to secure a larger
display of poultry was probably due to the fact that the superintendent of that
branch of the exhibits was appointed too late to enable him to make the
exhibit a complete success.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Bee Industries</em>.—The bee-keepers' exhibit was an interesting one and was shown in a building erected for that purpose at a cost of nearly $6,500. This exhibit was in charge of Superintendent E. Whitcomb, of
Friend, Nebr.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Liberal Arts</em>.—This exhibit was in charge of Mrs. Frances M. Ford as Superintendent. The building contained a collection of articles
and appliances indicative of the advance of civilization, for here was to be
found the modern typewriter and calculating machines—instruments fully
demonstrated to be of the utmost importance and utility in the present-day
commercial world; photographs, pianos, incubators and the like were also
displayed in a pleasing manner, so that the capacity of the building, 46,128
square feet of floor space, was crowded to the limit.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Machinery and Electricity</em>.—The machinery exhibit was a very satisfactory one and of a character calculated to secure the attention of the Western man, for whose especial benefit it was installed; but it was quite evident that the war waged between this country and Spain had quickened

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.262.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.262.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.262.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

an interest of the entire people in matters martial, for the exhibits of arms
and ammunition were scrutinized very carefully by them, while machinery.
which would at other times have claimed their attention, was passed by almost
unnoticed.</p>

<p>The progress made in the field of electricity was exhibited in a comprehensive and instructive manner, and every foot of floor space within the building was occupied by exhibits either of machinery or electrical appliances.</p>

<p>The superintendent of this building, Prof. H. B. Owens, having resigned,
the supervision of same fell upon H. B. Hardt as assistant to the manager of
the department.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Manufactures and International Exhibits</em>.—The buildings embraced in this Bureau were in charge of H. B. Hardt as superintendent, and all the space available for exhibition purposes was used to display specimens of interesting, novel and useful things arranged harmoniously. The exhibit booths in the Manufactures building were more elaborate and costly than those found in any of the other buildings. </p>

<p><em class="hi">International Hall</em>.—This structure was built for and devoted to the foreign exhibits and to the concessionaires in foreign goods and souvenirs. The floor space amounted to 18,583 square feet. Because of the novelties displayed in the way of foreign exhibits, this building received more than ordinary attention from visitors.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Transportation and Agricultural Implements</em>.—Delay in reaching a decision as to the size and character of the building to be constructed for this exhibit prevented the management from securing some very interesting exhibits illustrating the progress and development of transportation facilities in the United States, so it happened that all the space was utilized for the display of modern and practical implements and conveyances. Within this structure were four railroad tracks, which aided in the matter of unloading and disposing of the heavy exhibits within the building, and later they were filled with a variety of locomotives, railway cars, etc., as features of the Exposition. Fifty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty-eight feet of floor space within this building were sold to and occupied by one hundred and fifty-one exhibitors. D. H. Elliott was in charge as superintendent.</p>

<p><em class="hi">Bureau of Awards</em>.—The committee on awards was composed of J. M. Woolworth, chairman; John E. Utt, assistant chairman, and E. E. Bruce,
manager of the Exhibits Department.</p>

<p>A circular was sent to all the exhibitors asking each to name some man
as juror, and from the names thus secured a list was selected. A system of
checks was introduced calculated to prevent the perpetration of fraud. Out

appeals were made from the findings of the juries.</p>

<p>LAW DEPARTMENT</p>

<p>Carroll S. Montgomery, General Counsel of the Exposition Company,
gave oral advice to the Executive Committee, prepared and passed upon
A contracts and agreements during the preparatory period of the Exposition
work and during the period of operation written counsel or opinions were
furnished almost daily. Of contracts, 406 were made, 159 being general and
247 concessions. In February and April, 1898, the Board of Directors A
ordered the prosecution of delinquents for their subscriptions remaining
unpaid. A large number of actions were commended, but later, upon
a showing that the affairs of the company would be in shape to enable it to
pay back at least ·a portion of the subscriptions made, such suits were abandoned. In addition to the foregoing, 34 cases were prosecuted to settlement
or final judgment.</p>

<p>Considering the many and varied matters which were involved in connection with the affairs of the Exposition, the litigation was small in volume.
Five suits were for damages arising from personal injuries, and aggregated
$105,000. These particular suits were settled by payment to the parties of
the aggregate sum of $6,860. The services of Mr. Montgomery as above outlined were given to the Exposition Company without compensation.</p>

<p>CONCESSIONS AND PRIVILEGES DEPARTMENT</p>

<p>Under the management of Abraham L. Reed, assisted by S. E. Wadley,
Superintendent, the operations of this department assumed large proportions,
its receipts aggregating $308,569.80. The results are shown as follows:</p>

<p>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT</p>

<p>William N. Babcock, Manager. The object sought to be attained
through the medium of this branch of the management of Exposition affairs
was the obtaining and promulgating of favorable railroad and steamboat
rates for exhibits at the Exposition; to handle and account for exhibits upon
their arrival and effect their safe return to owners at the close of the Exposition. The department handled 5,417 consignments, consisting of 127,749
packages, weighing 10,603 tons, which business was transacted with such

<p>MIDWAY PLAISANCE AND MUSIC</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII</p>

<p>THE educational value of a great exposition is everywhere conceded. It is in many respects a school of information in which tens of thousands of visitors
acquire a first knowledge of things in which they feel a
special interest. Many instances might be cited, if necessary,
in support of this fact. In a great international exposition
displaying in the aggregate acres of special and collective
exhibits, the visitor soon finds the task of viewing and studying
the varied collections somewhat irksome. After spending a
portion of the day in such pursuit, he feels the need of
diversion, just as does the college student after a hard day's work at
his studies. This self-evident fact led the Exposition managers to
provide a playground containing many forms of amusement, in order
to add variety and zest to the daily bill of attractions and thus relieve
the monotony of the serious side of the Exposition proper. The
amusement section of the Omaha Exposition proved to be a most
attractive adjunct. It was not permitted to descend to the low plane of
questionable attractions, and because of this rule it maintained unusual
popularity to the end.</p>

<p>Reference to the map of the Exposition grounds shows two sections of
the Midway—one on the Bluff tract began at the Grand Plaza and extended
northward parallel to Sherman Avenue to the northernmost viaduct spanning
that thoroughfare. Crossing over this viaduct, the visitor entered the West
Midway, comprising the main attractions. This section lay north of and
parallel to the Grand Court, terminating at a point opposite to the axis of
the Court—the length of four city blocks from the viaduct. The two sections thus lay in the form of a letter L, the base line of which extended east and west from Sherman Avenue.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.267.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.267.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.267.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>These show features proved to be a constant attraction to visitors as
well as a constant source of revenue to the Exposition. The manager of
concessions reported aggregate receipts in the sum of $276,112. In order to

</div>

give an idea of the general characteristics of the Midway Plaisance it is necessary to mention only the main attractions, a description of which will not be attempted.</p>

<p>"Streets of all Nations" held an attraction attempting to present types of many different races, running largely to the Oriental, with camel-riding, fortune-telling, curio-selling, etc.—not unlike the chief characteristics of "Streets of Cairo," occupying a more advantageous site on the West Midway, near Twentieth Street. The architecture of the latter was somewhat artistic, with domes and minarets and stately mosque. These effects, with the many types of men and women of the Orient, created an atmosphere of Egyptian life fascinating to patrons of the Exposition. There were Turkish Minstrel characteristic dances, camels, donkeys, etc. The Moorish Palace was a large Algerian temple of highly pleasing architectural design. It contained wax figures of men and women; a chamber of horrors, said to be a reproduction of the Inferno. The German village on the Bluff tract was of quaint architecture—"Bratwurst Cloecklein," a famous inn of Nuremburg, centuries old, was reproduced. The "Deutsch Dorf" afforded show features. The Afro-American Village was a reproduction of a typical Southern plantation, with patches of cotton, sugar cane and tobacco.

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

</div>

Native darkies sang old plantation melodies. The Philippine Village on the
West Midway was a genuine attraction, presenting various types of men and women from the far-away archipelago, illustrating their customs, songs, language, habitations, avocations, etc. The visitor to the Chinese Village could well have imagined himself walking in the streets of Pekin, so closely did the buildings resemble those of the great capital of China. There was bamboo matting of fantastic design, and a bazaar containing a great variety of Chinese handiwork and curios of rare design. In the Chinese theatre there

were native actors and magicians. One of the chief attractions was Hagenbeck's Trained Animal Show. There was a miniature railway with a locomotive in operation weighing 450 pounds. "Havana and the Maine" was a reproduction of Havana harbor and its environs, with a realistic representation of the sinking of the big battleship. A cyclorama, "Merrimac and Monitor," illustrated the historic battle of those warships. On the East Midway the "Magic Maze" presented a labyrinth of flowers. A Japanese

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

Tea Garden was set in a scene of rare beauty. Among other attractions were
these: Haunted Swing, Giant See-Saw-elevating passengers 100 feet;
Scenic railway, a switch-back; grottoes containing optical illusions in
electricity; shooting the chutes, Wild West show, mirror maze—an illusion—Morro Castle, Plymouth Colony, Bohemian Inn, California gold-mining tunnel, glass-blowers, ostrich farm, "incubator" for the nurturing of very young infants, a camera obscura, Edison's wargraph, depicting the bombardment of Matanzas, Cuba; Italian villa, the flying lady—an illusion—and others.</p>

<p>MUSIC</p>

<p>The music of the Exposition was from first to last of unfailing excellence.
No single feature contributed more to the success of daily programs and
special events, while the many musical feasts served to patrons marked an
epoch in the development of musical appreciation, enhancing the popular taste for good music. No other exposition did more in the way of creating a general desire for the higher quality of music, Omaha people, particularly, receiving a liberal education from musicians of first rank whose artistic productions delighted everybody. During the five months of the Exposition season many strong musical organizations participated in the programs. The celebrated Theodore Thomas Orchestra of Chicago held sway for five weeks under the skillful conductorship of Mr. Arthur Mees, for some time assistant
conductor to Mr. Thomas, later conducting the "People's Concerts" in New
York, and eminent as an authority on musical matters, as well as a writer of ability. Emil Bare (now of Paris) was concert meister, Bruno Steindel was
the solo cellist, Schuecker the harpist and Quensel the solo flute, while other
instruments were represented by artists of high standing. The Apollo Club

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.271.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.271.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.271.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of Chicago gave several concerts under the personal direction of Mr. William
L. Tomlins, who was the conductor of the society. This organization presented the "Swan and Skylark" (Goring-Thomas), "The Messiah" (Handel)
in part, and the "Elijah" (Mendelssohn) in combination with the Exposition
chorus of 150 voices in "al fresco" concerts. The Minneapolis Choral Society,
under its conductor, Mr. Willard Patten, gave "Isaiah," a work composed
by him, bringing to the production a chorus of 200 voices. The Dubuque
Choral Society, under the conductorship of Mr. Portius Gane, gave the
"Creation" (Haydn) and "Barbara Frietszche" (Jules Jordan), with about
150 voices. The Exposition Chorus of Omaha gave (with its 150 singers)
"Fair Ellen" (Max Bruch), the "Rose Maiden" (Cowen), the "Daughter of
Jairus" (Stainer) and innumerable miscellaneous numbers at concerts in the
Auditorium, on the Grand Plaza and by the Lagoon, Assisting in the production of these works, which were given with the full orchestra, were the
following distinguished artists: Genevieve Clark Wilson, Helen Buckley,
Jenny Osborn, Sophia Markel, Anna Metcalf (sopranos); Katherine Fisk,
Mabelle Crawford and Estelle Rose (contraltos); George Hamlin, Holmes
Cowper and Stowe (tenors); Charles W. Clark (now of Paris) and Homer
Moore (baritones); Frank King Clark and Edmund Kuss (bassos), and
many others. There were bands galore: The United States Band, under the
baton of Mr. Phinney, formerly of the Iowa State Band; The Mexican
Band. under the chivalrous and suave Capitane Ricardo Pacheco; Innes
and his famous fifty, who captivated the people beyond measure at the close

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

</div>

of the Exposition; Santelmann and his great U. S. Marine Band, the President's own band from Washington, D. C., who opened the Exposition. Many smaller bands did good service, and were engaged a week at a time. The organ in the Auditorium, a fine three-manual, was a feature of the programs, organ recitals being given daily at 1:30 p. m. by Thomas Kelley and others. The work of the Bureau was outlined largely by Zachary T. Lindsey, chairman of the Executive Committee, and was developed and carried out by Willard Kimball of the Nebraska University up to June 30, and by his successor, Thomas Kelley of Omaha, from July 1 to the close of the Exposition on October 31. Miss Julia Officer of Council Bluffs was engaged to assist the Bureau as a manager of artists. The music of the Exposition was planned in such

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.272.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.272.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.272.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

a way as to please all classes of visitors. It was broad in its scope, and while entertaining, it was also highly instructive.</p>

<p>The music hall or auditorium was located near the east end of the basin,
and near, also, the Sherman Avenue entrance. Architecturally it was in
keeping with the general style of buildings in the Grand Court. The seating
capacity was 1,100. It was the scene of many notable gatherings.</p>

<p>GRAND PLAZA</p>

<p>On the Bluff tract, east of and nearly opposite to the Grand Court, at
wide, open space was provided for purposes of out-door gatherings of all
kinds, open-air band concerts, day and night, and especially for displays of
fireworks, which proved to be a constant source of pleasure to visitors during
the mid-summer season. The managers named this section the Grand Plaza.
Thousands of temporary chairs were provided, and the auditors faced a large
bandstand having a high sounding-board rising from the rear, by which the
sound of voices and instruments was deflected to a remarkable degree, thus
enhancing the effects of the music. The popularity of the Grand Plaza was
very great. It became the theatre of some of the chief historic events of the
Exposition season. Happily the official photographer, Frank Rinehart, made
a few striking pictures, which formed the only permanent record remaining
of some of the brilliant scenes enacted there. These grand spectacles will live
long in the memories of thousands of witnesses.</p>

<p>PROMOTION</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>

<p>THE work promoting the interests of the Exposition
on the beginning was accomplished by the President
of the Exposition Company, the stockholders and
others who earnestly desired to aid the projectors. Their
first efforts were bent to bring about a crystallization of sentiment
on the part of the Trans-Mississippi State legislatures favorable to
the Exposition, and to enlist the co-operation of their congressional
representatives with the Nebraska delegation in Congress, to the
end that the United States Government be prevailed upon to participate;
and subsequently, such State legislatures were invited to provide for a
proper representation by their several States.</p>

<p>The Department of Promotion, which was formed in December,
1896, at the reorganization of the company, had a very difficult and
important task to perform in connection with the affairs of the Exposition;
in difficult because of the fact that the project was entered upon at a time
when Nebraskans, especially, were suffering from the combined ill-effects
of the financial panic of 1893, and the drouths of 1894 and 1895, with incident
crop failures-a period when men were little disposed to invest money in a
venture which many prophesied would be a dismal failure. However, the
indomitable spirit of courage and energy of those who had undertaken the great
task of building an exposition was shared by those who directed the affairs of
the Department of Promotion, so that in spite of the croakings and dire
forebodings of many, the work was taken hold of with a zeal and earnestness
which brought good results.</p>

<p>The initial State legislation in behalf of the Exposition was secured
through the efforts of a joint committee of Omaha and Council Bluffs people,
comprising the following: G. W. Wattles, John A. Wakefield, ex-Governor
Alvin Saunders, Judge W. S. Strawn and Z. T. Lindsey of Omaha, and

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.275.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.275.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.275.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

</div>

Messrs. E. H. Odell, Charles R. Hannan, I. M. Treynor, G. Moore and
Thomas C. Dawson of Council Bluffs, which committee went to Des Moines
on February 10, in pursuance of a resolution introduced by C. S. Montgomery,
and adopted at a directors' meeting held January 27, 1896. The result of the
efforts of the committee at that time was the passage of a resolution by the
Iowa State legislature approving the movement to hold an exposition at
Omaha in 1898, and calling upon its Senators and Representatives in Congress
to co-operate with the Nebraska delegation in an effort to secure the enactment of legislation then pending, the purpose of which was to provide for
participation on the part of the United States by the erection of a Government
building on the Exposition grounds and the installation of exhibits therein.</p>

<p>In furtherance of the work of promotion it was deemed proper to act
upon the suggestions received through the mails that delegations be sent to
State capitals to lay the matter of the Exposition project before the different
Legislatures, and Messrs. Wattles, Lindsey and Babcock were delegated to act
as a committee to arrange for such trips.</p>

<p>During the month of February, 1897, several trips were arranged for
and were made by members of the Board of Directors, to the north, the south,
and the west. Perhaps the most notable of these journeys was that of the
delegation which traveled west in a private Pullman car which was hauled by
the Union Pacific Railroad and other railroads leading to the capitals of nine
different western States. In most of these States the delegation was given a
hearing before a special joint session of the Legislature, and while on account
of depleted treasuries, due to hard times, some of the States failed to make
appropriations, yet much work to the advantage of the Exposition was accomplished by this delegation, which comprised the following directors, who were

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.276.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.276.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.276.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

accompanied by their wives: G. W. Wattles, President; W. S. Poppleton,
G. M. Hitchcock, Clement Chase, John L. Webster, and H. E. Palmer. The
itinerary of this party included visits to the capitals of the following States:
Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, Oregon and California.
Another expedition was headed northward about the same time, reaching
the capital of the State of Minnesota February 17, 1897, and thereafter
visiting, among other places, the capitals of North and South Dakota. The
personnel of this party was as follows: Z. T. Lindsey, L. C. Crofoot and

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>The First Promotion Expedition</p>
 
</div>

I. W. Carpenter of Omaha, and C. M. Harl of Council Bluffs. This delegation
occupied the private car of General Manager Bidwell of the Northwestern
Railway.</p>

<p>The South Dakota Legislature adjourned without making an appropriation in aid of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, but passed resolutions heartily
commending it and recommending that South Dakota be well represented 
through the medium of private subscriptions. The Nebraska delegation
believed that the wealthy citizens of that State would take such an interest in
the matter that Marcus Daly's generosity, hereafter referred to, would be out-
done, and that a fund of not less than $25,000 would be raised wherewith to

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.277.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.277.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.277.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

make a proper exhibit. A snow storm prevented the Omaha delegates from
leaving Pierre as soon as they had expected to do, but the week they spent
there was not wasted, as the legislators were likewise weather bound and ample
opportunity was presented wherein to do missionary work, of which the
Exposition boomers duly availed themselves.</p>

<p>Still another expedition left Omaha during February, this excursion
being headed southward, the points it was planned to visit including Jefferson
City, Mo., Little Rock, Ark., Texarkana, Waco, Ft. Worth, El Paso and
Austin, Tex., the City of Mexico, and Guthrie, Okla. However, due to
unforeseen contingencies arising, some changes were made so that the party,
comprising Messrs. Euclid Martin, C. S. Montgomery, O. Phillippi, E. J. Cornish, Rev. S. Wright Butler, and Major E. H. Crowder from Omaha, and
Judge A. Cornish of Lincoln, visited instead St. Louis and Jefferson City,
Mo., Little Rock and Hot Springs, Ark., San Antonio, Tex., and the City of
Mexico, Orizaba and Cordova, Mex. In Mexico the delegation received a
private audience with President Diaz, who took great interest in the enterprise
and intimated that as soon as his Government received an invitation from the
proper officials of the United States to participate in the Exposition, Mexico
would take steps to be properly represented.</p>

<p>About this time other excursions were made by individual directors, or
committees appointed by the board, to points less distant from Omaha, and
A such visitations were productive of much good in creating a sentiment favorable to the great undertaking, and also by securing contributions and subscriptions to stock in the enterprise; members of State Legislatures in the
Trans-Mississippi country to the number of considerably more than 2,000
were communicated with and copies of proposed bill helpful to the cause

were sent forward; circular letters were furnished to business men which set
forth the merits of the cause, and they distributed among their customers
copies thereof to the number of 50,000. Congressman Mercer visited the
Embassies in Washington and endeavored to persuade the diplomatic corps to
send consuls to Omaha during the Exposition period so that exhibitors and
would-be exhibitors could have resident representatives of their respective
countries upon whom they might call or inquire of concerning the Exposition.
The hearty co-operation of Mr. H. N. Higginbotham, former President of the
World's Fair, was secured, and he accompanied a delegation of Nebraskans to
Springfield, Ill., in the interest of a bill then pending before the Illinois State Legislature, and in meeting the claims that the State treasury was depleted and retrenchment necessary, he called attention to the aid Nebraska had rendered the World's Fair project, asked for reciprocal action, and indicated that assistance given the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in the form of appropriate State representation would be highly advantageous to the State of Illinois. So convincing were the arguments adduced by the delegation in question, that the Illinois Legislature later appropriated $45,000 with which a State exhibit was made, which occupied 60,000 square feet of floor space in the various exhibit buildings, while a magnificent State building was created at a cost of nearly $10,000, which contained, among other things, famous paintings by John R. Key, and which was visited by 10,000 residents of Illinois, many of
whom were privileged to take part in the notable ceremonies of two special
days set apart for the State of Illinois. One of these was designated as
"Illinois Day" and the other "Chicago Day."</p>

<p>Manager Hitchcock of the Department of Promotion instigated and made
considerable progress with a plan to secure the mobilization at Omaha during

the Exposition period of the National Guard, and a portion of the United
States army, but resigned his position as the head of that department before
the scheme had fully matured. Before anything definite was accomplished
in regard to it, war clouds appeared and actual hostilities later entirely prevented the accomplishment of what would have been a great feature of the
Exposition.</p>

<p>The Governor of Nebraska was prevailed upon to issue a proclamation
to citizens of Nebraska inviting active co-operation to make the undertaking
a success, and he also issued a similar proclamation to the Governors of the
Trans-Mississippi States.</p>

<p>A movement was set on foot to secure a Congress of Agricultural Societies at Omaha, during the Exposition, and the good will of the Secretary of
Agriculture was secured to this end. He stated that his department would be
represented and he himself would endeavor to be present. United States
Consuls were furnished with information regarding the Exposition, and their
interest and assistance enlisted and generally secured in the cause.</p>

<p>Manager Rosewater called on the Postmaster-General and prevailed on
him to issue a series of commemorative postage stamps, but not without
some effort. Under the impression that the Exposition would be but local in
character, the Postmaster-General at first declined to look with favor on the
suggestion, but proof being furnished him from the Department of State that
the United States, Government had recognized its international feature by
issuing invitations to foreign nations to participate, the Postmaster-General
consented to order a special issue of stamps, which was done.</p>

<p>A large party of representative Nebraskans left Omaha in two Pullman
cars on February 13, 1898, bent solely upon performing missionary work in

public place where opportunity was offered to members of the delegation to
make known the object of their visit, and by visiting clubs, etc., considerable
work was done in the direction of awakening an interest in favor of the
Exposition; also, by the distribution of literature and otherwise, the people
were made familiar with the magnitude and importance of the Exposition
project.</p>

<p>Having, by commingling with the people, exercised an influence boding
good for the Exposition, the department later kept in touch by correspondence
with those sections where encouragement seemed needful to secure desired
action; and where apathy or non-action appeared, representatives of the
Exposition were sent again among the people and the work persisted in,
despite the existence of discouraging conditions, until success was attained.
Then, desiring "to be shown," people from other States, sometimes under
commissions from the Governors, visited Omaha to determine for themselves whether or not the representations made to them by interested parties
with reference to the Exposition were borne out by the facts in the case. Their
visits were frequently productive of immediate good, as the delegates would
return with such glowing accounts of the Exposition plans and progress
being made thereon, that their sponsors became fired with enthusiasm for
the enterprise and a desire for representation.</p>

<p>Much of what has been written with reference to the various excursions
inaugurated for promotion purposes may not appear to be very material in a
history of this character, and would not be, but for the fact of the incalculable
benefits accruing to the enterprise by reason thereof. A strong sentiment had
been fostered in many quarters that the proposed exhibit would be a very
commonplace affair; was local in character and that its promoters in efforts

at exploitation had allowed their enthusiasm such latitude as to lead them
into making extravagant claims concerning the project, and it was in large
part to overcome this erroneous impression that representative Nebraska citizens went forth to interview and to convince the leading citizens of other
States, that the Exposition would be just such a one as claimed; and, judged
by results, the method adopted succeeded where no other plan could have
done so.</p>

<p>The treasuries of many States were not in a healthy condition, some completely depleted, only nine Trans-Mississippi States promising an exhibit at
the time the bill was signed which gave assurance of the United States Government participating; yet when the gates of the Exposition were opened,
each and every State and territory in that vast region was represented by
exhibits of an intensely interesting character.</p>

<p>One of several instances might be cited where success was snatched from
a situation which spelled failure. A visit of a Nebraska delegation to the
Montana capital was had on Washington's birthday, 1897, and the situation
then did not look promising. The party on leaving Helena went to Butte,
where Manager Hitchcock, of the Department of Promotion, met Mr. Marcus
Daly, a man of prominence and great influence in that State. The mission
of the party was unfolded to that gentleman, and the outcome of the visit to
the State Legislature was made known to him. He at first was disinclined
to become interested, but the argument made by Mr. Hitchcock soon secured
from him a promise to do what he could to help out the Exposition. The delegation proceeded on its way, but had traveled less than goo miles when a
telegram apprised them of the fact that an offer of Mr. Daly to duplicate
any amount appropriated by the State of Montana for representation at the

Trans-Mississippi Exposition, had been considered, and $15,000 appropriated
by the State, so that an exhibit from Montana costing not less than $30,000
was assured.</p>

<p>Considerable effort had been put forth by Manager Rosewater of the
Department of Publicity and Promotion, to secure favorable consideration of
a scheme to hold an Indian Congress at the Exposition, and by dint of hard
work on the part of those interested in promoting the welfare of the enterprise, a bill was passed by Congress which guaranteed an exhibition of the
character referred to, which proved to be a stellar attraction, for never before
had such a large and interesting gathering of the tribes of red men been
effected as that which distinguished the Omaha Exposition of 1808.</p>

<p>A bureau of special attractions was organized, but much was accomplished by the Promotion Department along those lines, notably the work
done in connection with the engagement of the Marine band, as well as the
assembling of representatives from numerous tribes of Indians at a so-called
Congress.</p>

<p>The Exposition project contended with many untoward conditions,
passed through many trying situations, and succeeded only because of the
unwavering faith its promoters had in the outcome, and the good generalship
displayed in the management of its affairs. When first mooted, the idea of
sending out excursions was frowned down, and not until demands were made
by residents of neighboring States for representative Nebraska citizens to be
sent among them with a view to enlightening them concerning the true status
of the Exposition, was the importance of such a move appreciated by many
of the Exposition directors. The work which presented itself for the delegations to perform, and the resulting benefits which later became manifest,

demonstrated beyond peradventure the wisdom of such a move, and especially
notable are the results thus accomplished in view of the fact that during the
period of greatest activity, the Exposition boomers who traveled through
many States, endeavoring to enthuse and move to action the people of the
western States, were unable to point to very great results actually accomplished in the way of securing material support outside of the city of Omaha.
The pending bill in the Nebraska State Legislature had not been passed, so
that when asked what the State of Nebraska had done to help the work along,
the delegations were compelled to make the humiliating admission that it had
done nothing. Hence, it is not surprising that the task of securing the desired
co-operation on the part of the surrounding States was a difficult and discouraging one. The opposition to passage of the bill pending before the
Nebraska State Legislature was met and successfully overcome by those upon
whom had fallen much of the burden of the promotion work. The bill in
question carried an appropriation of $100,000; thereafter Douglas County
raised a like sum, and the city of Omaha augmented the total by some thirty
thousand dollars expended in parking and such work in aid of the Exposition.
These events, in connection with the bill passed by Congress providing for a
Government building and exhibit, gave great impetus to the promotion work,
increased the growing interest in the Exposition, and brought about such a
demand for space in the exhibition building provided for in the general plan,
that the construction of additional buildings became imperative. Thirty-five
States appointed Exposition commissioners and the following appropriations
were made to cover expenses of participating in the Exposition:</p>

"Special Days" at the Exposition were arranged for with appropriate ceremonies.</p>

<p>The strained relations existing between this country and Spain during the
early part of 1898, followed by the declaration of war, naturally interfered
with some of the plans of the promoters of the Exposition, but not to the
extent of postponing the date for opening the Exposition, the gates to which
swung inward on the appointed day. About this time the <em class="hi">Washington Post</em> remarked that "the people out at Omaha are quite enterprising, but they will
be sure to ascertain that this thing of running an Exposition in opposition to
a war, is no good job." Those interested had doubtless become cognizant of
that fact, but undismayed, they applied themselves with redoubled ardor to
get out the crowds, and so well did they succeed that the Exposition has title
to the claim of being the first of the kind in America to pay back to the stockholders any considerable amount of the money invested—the Trans-Mississippi
Exposition Company returning to its stockholders 90 per cent of the face
value of their stock.</p>

<p>The war with Spain being at an end, a "Peace Jubilee" at the Exposition
was suggested, the idea was adopted, and steps were taken to bring it about.
The President of the United States, his cabinet officers, the diplomatic corps,
United States Senators, and others of prominence, were invited to participate.
The President and his official family accepted the invitation given, a large
number of the diplomatic corps did likewise, and the week of October 9-15
was the time fixed upon for the visit, which week was destined to be the banner
one of the Exposition period. The attendance was immense, and the interesting scenes incident to the visit of so many notables to the Exposition were
features of the occasion.</p>

<p>The campaign for congressional recognition began in January, 1896, and
culminated June 6 of that year by the passage of an act providing for the
erection of a Government building on the Exposition grounds and the placing
therein of exhibits illustrating the operations of the various departments of
government. For these purposes the bill carried an appropriation of $2000,000.
Later, Congress appropriated $45,000 for the Indian exhibit. In both
instances the action of Congress was due in great part to the ceaseless activities
of many of Omaha's most prominent men.</p>

<p>ORGANIZATION AND REORGANIZATION</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>

<p>DURING the fall of 1895, a number of prominent and
public-spirited Omaha citizens decided that an Exposition of a character and on a scale calculated to portray the resources and development of the Trans-Mississippi country should be held, in Omaha; and as a result of such conclusion a resolution strongly favoring such a
movement was introduced in and adopted by the Trans-Mississippi
Congress at its session in Omaha during November of that year.
The men who took the initiative in the matter were those who
had been the leading spirits in the Omaha Fair and Speed Association, whose efforts to induce the State Board of Agriculture to hold
the State Fair in Omaha had been successful. These men were
among the first to see the need of a larger Exposition, and were firm
in the belief that Omaha possessed strength enough to project it.
Most of these men were called to serve in the first directory of eleven
men, named on the following page. Among others were John A.
Wakefield, Z. T. Lindsey, Frank D. Brown, Geo. H. Kelley, William Krug
and Wm. A. Paxton, Jr.</p>

<p>Meetings were subsequently held in furtherance of the object, and on 
January 18, 1896, a citizens' meeting effected an organization by adopting
articles of incorporation, prepared by C. S. Montgomery, which contemplated
an Exposition to be held June 1, to November 1, 1898, instead of from August
to October as provided in the tentative draft of articles of incorporation presented by the committee. The authorized capital stock was $1,000,000 at $10
per share, complete organization to be effected after $10,000 had been subscribed.</p>

<p>Subscriptions were called for and those attending the meeting promptly
subscribed $10,650 whereupon the assemblage resolved itself into a stock-

' meeting; the articles of incorporation as amended were read and
forthwith, on motion, approved.</p>

<p>Eleven directors were then elected, as follows: Gurdon W. Wattles.
Jacob A. Markel, W. R. Bennett, John H. Evans, Dudley Smith, Dan'l
Farrell, Jr., Geo. H. Payne, Charles Metz, Isaac W. Carpenter, Henry A.
Thompson and C. S. Montgomery.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the Board of Directors was held January 20, 1896,
and the following officers were then elected: Gurdon W. Wattles, President;
Jacob E. Markel, Vice-President; John A. Wakefield, Secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. E. H. Odell, representing the Manufacturers' and Merchants' Club
at Council Bluffs, appeared at this meeting and made manifest the friendly
interest which the people of Council Bluffs entertained for the undertaking,
which led to the formation of a committee representing Council Bluffs. The
subsequent co-operation of this committee with the efforts of the Exposition
management was of no little benefit in securing the enactment of federal legislation on June 10, 1896, providing for representation by the United States
at the Exposition.</p>

<p>On January 24, 1896, Herman Kountze was elected treasurer, Carroll
S. Montgomery, general counsel and John E. Utt, railway commissioner. At
the same meeting by-laws were presented and adopted.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Board of Directors held May 23, 1898, it was
decided to make an issue of negotiable bonds in the sum of $200,000 secured
by a mortgage on go per cent of the gate receipts and upon the buildings and
other property of the Exposition. The bonds and the mortgage to protect
them were prepared, providing that Joseph H. Millard, President of the

Omaha National Bank, Charles W. Lyman, President of the Commercial
National Bank, and (the late) Frank Murphy, President of the Merchants'
National Bank, should be a board of trustees for the bonds. For various
reasons the bonds were never issued and were finally destroyed.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Board of Directors June 19, 1896, it was decided
to call a meeting for July 20, and to issue special invitations to leading citizens
to serve as a bureau of finance for the Exposition. The meeting was held.
and after full discussion a resolution was adopted recommending that the sum
of half a million dollars be raised through stock subscriptions, and that a
permanent finance committee be named which would have custody of all funds
and have general financial management of the Exposition. The resolution
named the following men as members of the committee: Herman Kountze,
Joseph H. Millar, Frank Murphy, F. P. Kirkendall, Z. T. Lindsey, G. W. 
Wattles G. W. Lininger, Alvin Saunders, H. W. Yates, V. B. Caldwell,
A. L. Reed, E. E. Bruce, E. Rosewater, Edwin A. Cudahy, Alfred Millard,
Lucius Wells, Guy C. Barton, Frank Colpetzer, W. S. Poppleton, C. E. Yost,
W. A Paxton, J. A Creighton. C. F. Manderson, Harold McCormick, David
Anderson.</p>

<p>This committee pursuant to instruction prepared a report which was
submitted at a meeting of citizens on June 22, 1896. This report recommended a plan of organization which was for the most part adopted by the
Board of Directors who based the reorganization plans upon the recommendations of the committee whose special report was signed by the following men: Herman Kountze, Joseph H. Millard, Henry W. Yates, Guy C. Barton, C. E. Yost and F. P. Kirkendall.</p>

subscribed a board of not less than fifty directors should be elected. In compliance with that proviso a call was issued for a meeting of stockholders for
October 1, 1896, which action, at the earnest solicitation of heavy stockholders,
was later rescinded and a new call issued for December 1, instead.</p>

<p>WHAT OMAHA DID</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV</p>

<p>ANY chronicle of the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition, if it be faithful to the subject must
necessarily reflect the loyalty, capacity and strength
of the people of Omaha. Indeed, it is difficult to treat of
the growth and completion of the project without constant
reference, direct or implied, to the unexampled labors and
triumphs achieved by Omaha's men and women. Every
chapter, in a degree, must measure some element of the city's
strength because the completed Exposition was largely created
as by Omaha brain and brawn; yet it is thought to be proper and fitting
to devote one chapter to a somewhat particular reference to the part
played by Omaha in the great undertaking. The genius of her men of
affairs proved to be equal to the taking up of a great work upon
lines of action entirely original, and to the finishing of an Herculean task,
scoring a brilliant success in the face of difficulties, the like of which
never confronted the builders of any other exposition. The plain facts of
solid achievement may be recorded without vainglorious boasting, and yet
the successes attained in some particulars were so extraordinary as to make
difficult their recital without laying the chronicler liable to the charge of
exaggeration.</p>

<p>The success of every American Exposition has depended upon the energy
and capacity of the men of the city wherein it was located. Some of the
expositions failed largely because of the shortcomings of the cities projecting
them. The simple fact that Omaha was strong enough to create a great
Exposition, and carry it to triumphant success, is a high encomium sufficient
within itself to raise the city and its people in the estimation of the best men
of the country. Perhaps it is true that some of the men who assumed the
heavy burdens incident to the work of creating the Exposition, did not at

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.299.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.299.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.299.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

</div>

first fully realize the magnitude of the task; nor could they have foretold the outbreak of war with a foreign power at a time when the fate of the Exposition hung in the balance. However, they knew that a colossal enterprise was being projected, calling for greater effort than Omaha men had ever been called upon to put forth, and having put their hands to the plough, that typical western pluck and energy, characteristic of the Trans-Mississippi region, led them on to brilliant achievement and unparalleled success. As the years roll on, bringing to the mind's eye a truer perspective of the completed Exposition and the immense task involved in the building, the results attained seem to be more striking in their magnitude than they ever did before.</p>

<p>From the inception of the project down to the end of the third month
of the Exposition season, the paramount problem was that of finance. Omaha's
best citizenship addressed itself to the task of solving this problem. At a
meeting held on January 18, 1896, to consider a tentative draft of articles of
incorporation, voluntary subscriptions amounting to $10,650 were readily
made by men who were quick to see the prospective benefits of a creditable
Exposition. This chronicle would be incomplete without reference to the
first committee appointed for soliciting stock. This action was taken at a
citizens' meeting January 18, 1896, the committee being composed of Messrs.
Z. T. Lindsey, W. R. Bennett, Charles Metz, I. W. Carpenter and C. C.
Belden. The committee at once asked for subscriptions, the response being
hearty. Out of the 50 or more citizens attending the meeting the following
gave $500 each: Edward Rosewater, W. J. Connell, H. Evans, Dan Farrell, Jr., Lee-Clark-Andreesen Company, W. R. Bennett Company, J. E. Markel &amp; Son, Thompson, Belden &amp; Company, William Krug, Oscar Pick-

ard
, Metz Bros., Frank B. Hibbard, Dudley Smith, Kelley, Stiger &amp; Company.
One man, John A. Weaver, pledged $400, and Ashton Clemens and G. S.
Ambler pledged $300 each. Z. T. Lindsey and Lyman Richards gave $250
and C. 8. Montgomery and L. H. Bradley gave $200 each. The following
pledged $100 each: C. S. Hayward, O. C. Holmes, W. C. Bullard, Helin &amp;
Thompson, Johnson Bros., Fisher &amp; Lawrie, G. W. Wattles, John A. Wakefield, John E. Utt, Gibson, Euclid Martin, M. H. DeLong, Geo. N. Hicks,
W. H. Roberson, Robt. W. Richardson and Isaac W. Carpenter. Three men
pledged $50 each: I. E. Burdick, G. A. Rathbun and George A. Payne; A
total, $10,650.</p>

<p>Thus did public-spirited men of Omaha give to the Exposition project
its first great impulse. Later on as plans were further discussed and developed
the projectors decided that Omaha must raise by popular subscription $300,000
in order to put the enterprise upon a solid foundation. Pursuant to this plan
of campaign the Board of Directors met June 10, 1806, and issued invitations to a number of citizens to serve as a bureau of finance of the Exposition. The meeting was well attended, adopting a resolution recommending
that the sum of $500,000 be raised by stock subscriptions, and naming a
permanent committee of finance comprising 24 men, every one of whom had
done his part in the work of upbuilding Omaha.</p>

<p>Those who can readily recall the stressful condition of trade and finance
in 1806, and the consequent impairment of property values, will not fail to
appreciate the difficulties with which these courageous projectors had to contend. Today the raising of half a million dollars for an object equally laudable would present a task comparatively easy, but in those days the promoters met with many obstacles, at times seemingly insuperable. No wonder there were men of prominence who said the money could not be raised; they honestly believed that the people of Omaha could not produce the requisite amount of cash within the prescribed limit of time, because of the effects of

drouth and panic. But the stout-hearted men who had entered the lists to
win turned deaf ears to the plaints of the croakers and proceeded vigorously
with the campaign for stock subscriptions. At a meeting of the Board of
Directors held September 12, 1896, the soliciting committee reported that
$320,000 had been subscribed with $40,000 additional assured. On October
it was reported that 6,124 persons had subscribed $343,080. The canvass proceeded with vigor. The money was largely subscribed by residents
or corporations directly interested in Omaha. It was given from the purses
of the poor as well as from the coffers of the rich. On November 27, 1896,
the directors were notified that the Burlington Railway Company had donated
$30,000. The announcement was received with cheers. No other railroad
company had up to that time donated or subscribed to the Exposition fund.
Officials of all the roads centering in Omaha had looked askance at the project,
sharing in the doubt expressed by croakers that Omaha had strength and
ability necessary to build an Exposition. Their attitude had become a matter
of grave concern to members of the Executive Committee and to the directory.
Gen. Charles F. Manderson, one of the most active directors and general
solicitor of the Burlington Railway, was importuned to lay the situation before
President Perkins (deceased), who then resided at Burlington. Enlisting
the aid of General Manager Holdrege, it was decided to be advisable to seek
an interview with Mr. Perkins, and Messrs. Manderson and Holdrege took
the latter's private car and proceeded to Burlington. When Mr. Perkins thus
learned what had been accomplished by the people of Omaha in providing
financial support, he did not longer hesitate to place the Burlington system on
record as a patron of the Exposition. He authorized Gen. Manderson to
notify the Exposition management that his road would donate $30.000 in
promotion of the great enterprise. The grateful appreciation of the Board
of Directors was expressed in a resolution of thanks which was adopted with
hearty cheers and ordered to be forwarded to the officials of the road. A
clause of the resolution also expressed the thanks of Omaha, and of the
Exposition Company, for the notification that the Burlington Company would
soon begin the erection of a new passenger station at Omaha.</p>

<p>The donation of the Burlington road was regarded as the harbinger of
another era of good luck, for other lines having large interests in Omaha were
expected each to donate or to subscribe an equal amount. In fact, there was
little doubt that all the roads would aid the enterprise. Some of their lawyers
thought the companies could not legally hold stock of the Exposition Company. The delay was attributed to failure upon the part of the railroad
managers to reach an agreement, not only as to the amount, but they debated
the question (born of their experience with other expositions) whether to

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.302.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.302.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.302.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

donate or to subscribe to the fund for building the Exposition. The railroad
officials may have been warranted at that time in raising the query whether
possession of capital stock in the Omaha Exposition would prove to be an
asset or a liability. So the Burlington's donation at once solved the problem
and set the pace. It came at a most opportune time. Through the active
efforts of General Manager Geo. F. Bidwell of the Northwestern lines west
of the Missouri River, the higher officials of that great system soon matched
the Burlington's donation. As a director of the Exposition Company, Mr.
Bidwell was in position to keep President Hughitt posted as to the true status
of Exposition affairs. The Union Pacific System donated $25,000; the Missouri Pacific $15,000, and the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, $10,000, the
latter road then having no mileage in Nebraska outside of Omaha. The Rock
Island system subscribed to the stock of the Exposition $20,000, thus expressing faith in the ultimate success of the enterprise. That faith was in the
end rewarded by the repayment of 00 per cent of the subscription. It is not the
province of the historian to determine the relative degree of credit merited by
these great corporations whose officials displayed unusual generosity in their
treatment of the Exposition. The local public utility corporations were likewise generous. At that time the policy of the Omaha Street Railway Company
as well as that of the Omaha Gas Company was dominated by the late Frank
Murphy. Each of these companies subscribed $10,000 while Mr. Murphy personally subscribed $5,000. The late Herman Kountze subscribed $10,000
which was perhaps the largest individual subscription to the building fund.
The Union Stock Yards Company and the Nebraska Telephone Company, controlled by Omaha men, each subscribed $5,000, as did the Byron Reed Company and the Chicago Lumber Company of Omaha. The New York Life
Insurance Company and the late Philip D. Armour, having large interests
in Omaha, each subscribed $5,000, as did the late Edward Rosewater, one of
the prime movers of the great project. This completes the list of those whose
subscriptions or donations ranged from $5,000 to $30,000. Without this
munificent fund, and the tremendous moral uplift its bestowal gave to the
Exposition at a time when success was problematical, it is perhaps not too much
to say that the project would have collapsed. At the time the money was
given the donors were by common consent accorded a place on the roll of
honor. An analysis of the list makes apparent the fact that every dollar of the
$200,000 was given at the behest of Omaha men and because of the influence
they could bring to bear. It is the best illustration ever afforded of the high
rank attained by Omaha as a commercial center. The campaign waged by
these and other influential Omahans in enlisting the support of non-residents
who had vested interests here, afforded material for a highly interesting

chapter of history, which, for the most part, must remain unwritten. Many
things were planned and done quietly, a sense of good taste preventing at
the time a public statement of what was done. Nearly every railroad man
in Omaha was an active agent in work for the promotion of the enterprise.
Leading merchants and heavy shippers put their shoulders to the wheel and
helped to make a showing of fact upon which the directorates of large corporations could base favorable action. Influential citizens made frequent trips to
New York, Chicago, St. Louis and elsewhere for the sole purpose of inducing officials of insurance companies, railways, packing houses, etc., to makes
subscriptions to the capital stock of the Exposition.</p>

<p>Meantime, the activity of soliciting committees had produced remarkable
results by appeals to all classes of citizens. Sub-committees were formed and
assigned to a given group of people, confining their efforts to them alone. By
this systematic work the canvass was thoroughly made and the one committee kept out of the territory of the other. The zeal and efficiency of these
committees were attested by the large amount of money they raised. In looking back over the forces contributing to the ultimate success of the Exposition
it is easy to see the tremendous impetus which these soliciting committees
imparted to the work of building the Exposition. Here is a report of their
gleanings:</p>

Omaha's faith in the enterprise eighteen months prior to the day appointed for
the opening of the Exposition. It was evidence to all that the community had
awakened to a realization of the fact that Omaha possessed strength enough
to build and complete a great Exposition. This figure expresses in dollars and
cents the magnificent result of the labors performed under the direction of the
original directory of eleven men who were elected at a citizens' meeting on
January 18, 1896, as follows: Gurdon W. Wattles, Jacob E. Markel, W. R.
Bennett, John H. Evans, Dudley Smith, Daniel Farrell, Jr., George H. Payne.
Charles Metz, Isaac W. Carpenter, Henry A. Thompson and Carroll S. Montgomery. The first meeting of this board was held January 20, 1896, and the
following officers were then elected: Gurdon W. Wattles, President; Jacob
E. Markel, Vice-President; John A. Wakefield, Secretary.</p>

<p>As the plan and scope gradually broadened, the project, of course,
required more financial support, notwithstanding the generous response made
by the people to the call of the officers and directors under the original organization. Up to this time the brunt of the battle had been borne by a few men,
and the victory they achieved entitled them to more credit than was ever
accorded to them. Their failure was predicted by a few men who later jumped
into the harness and pulled faithfully to the end. For more than a year, or
until the date of reorganization, December 16, 1896, the destiny of the Exposition was shaped by the original directory of eleven men and the officers who
executed its plans. In another chapter the action resulting in reorganization
is set forth in detail.</p>

<p>The articles of association were amended authorizing an enlarged board
of fifty directors. The business of the company having grown to such large
proportions, it was deemed advisable to divide the work into seven departments, two of which were later consolidated. The managers of these departments constituted the executive committee, which conducted the enterprise up
to the closing day. While under the new regime responsibility for success or
failure was to the end shared by the board of fifty directors in whom was vested ultimate power of control, yet the main load rested heavily upon the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.306.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.306.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.306.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

shoulders of the men comprising the executive committee, whose members,
» acting as managers together with the President, through long, weary months
gave nearly all of their time and attention to the promotion of the project.
During the last year of the work the committee held daily sessions, the
President, with counsel and secretary, being in constant attendance. On the
closing day of the Exposition, in his address summing up the results of the
Exposition, President Wattles voiced the sentiment of the whole community
when he said: "To these managers, who have served without compensation,
this community owes a debt that can never be paid; and while it is usual to
give the commanding general credit for victory in a great battle, in many
instances, as with the Exposition, this credit is equally due to the efficient
services of his assistants and to the common soldiers, which includes nearly
every representative citizen in this community—for all have worked with one
purpose to build up this enterprise and bring to it the large measure of success
it has attained."</p>

<p>It would hardly be profitable to rehearse the events incident to recurring
crises in the progress of the enterprise, but it is interesting to recall one episode
of the winter of 1897, when "huge boulders almost choked the stream of cash,
and strong men among the projectors came to the rescue with their financial
credit and their money. One of the contractors of a large building in course
of construction had waited several days for the payment of money due him
on a given estimate, and became noisily importunate. One morning he
knocked at the door of the Executive Committee room and sent in word that
unless his estimate of $12,000 were paid within thirty minutes he would stop
work on the building and publish his reasons for so doing. There was less
than $1,000 in the treasury. The threatened action of the contractor, if carried
out, would have wrecked the financial credit of the Exposition Company.
Such a calamity was averted by Chairman Lindsey and President Wattles.
who advanced the money until the Exposition treasury could be replenished
and repayment made. In another crisis, the President, managers and Secretary personally endorsed notes and raised money with which to relieve the situation.</p>

<p>Conditions having gradually improved, the outlook, February 1, 1898,
was quite favorable, and the projectors of the Exposition felt the inspiration
of impending success. But during that month came the unexpected breaking
out of hostilities with Spain. This untoward event caused many prospective
exhibitors to cancel applications for space. Newspapers everywhere subordinated all matter to war news and pictures; men became dubious; clouds, low
and ominous, hung heavily over the Exposition. Some of the directors
advised postponement until 1899—others would have abandoned the project

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.307.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.307.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.307.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

entirely. Only a few men steed pat and urged that plans be proceeded with.
A conference was called by the President of members of the Executive Committee and the more steadfast members of the directory. The situation, in
all its bearings, was carefully discussed. The proposal to abandon the project
could not be entertained, for the reason that such a course would have blasted
the reputation of Omaha throughout the country; on the other hand, postponement, it was thought, would inevitably lead to failure and humiliation.
The consensus of opinion was that Omaha could not afford to avail itself of
either alternative, and therefore it was decided that the only thing to do was
to proceed carefully and confidently, with a determination to win success
despite all adverse conditions. Every man then and there resolved to redouble
his energies; measures of economy were adopted; more effective work was
done in all departments, and by the restoration of popular confidence ultimate
success was assured. The war cloud precipitated the greatest crisis in the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.308.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.308.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.308.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

affairs of the Exposition. Nobody could then foretell the duration of a war
with Spain. There was in the popular mind apprehension that the naval
strength of that great power might equal that of the United States. Some
A men predicted that hostilities would last a year—very few thought that the
war could be ended with so little disturbance of industrial and trade conditions
as happily proved to be the case. Omaha men responsible, financially and
A otherwise, for rapid advancement of the work of building the Exposition were
confronted, in the face of the Spanish-American war, with a problem involving
higher consequences than any other grappled with in the earlier years of the
city's history. The fate of the Exposition, involving the good name of Omaha,
hung in the balance. There was no State or city or set of men outside of
Omaha that could be appealed to for aid. A great emergency had to be met
by men who never lost faith in the people of Omaha and their ability to
overcome all difficulties. Every property owner in Omaha owes to these
strong and loyal men a lasting debt of gratitude for upholding the financial
credit of the Exposition Company in the hour of peril. Had they then
abandoned the project to its fate, humiliating failure would have ensued, the
consequences of which would have been so damaging to Omaha in the eyes
of the whole country that recovery could not have been expected within a
generation.</p>

<p>Doggedly persevering in the grand work which lay before them, the
men of Omaha accomplished a seemingly impossible task. During the year
1897, most of the money was paid in on stock subscriptions. The record
shows that a grand total of $5 53,41 5.20 was pledged by 6,500 stockholders.
After the requisite sum and more had been subscribed, the pessimists predicted that a large share of it would prove to be uncollectible, not because
subscribers did not intend to pay, but because of prevailing hard times. That
they did not know the temper of the men of Omaha was soon demonstrated.
The report of the Ways and Means Department gives evidence of the willingness and ability of the people of Omaha to pay their subscriptions to the
capital stock of the Exposition.</p>

<p>Incident to the closing-day exercises, President Wattles made an address
which was largely devoted to a summary of results. He told his hearers that
$454,979.24 had been up to that time paid into the Exposition treasury on
account of subscriptions and donations, and that, together with the earnings
of the corporation, the grand total of cash receipts up to that time from all
sources was $1,761,364.18. Later this was increased to $1,977,338.69. The 
cash in the treasury amounted to $420,996.48, and after paying all legitimate
claims there would remain a cash balance of $356,011.46 Much of this
sum was used in reimbursing stockholders. In this connection it is interest-

ing
 to quote a statement made by Secretary Wakefield by way of summing
up results accomplished: "This was the only Exposition in America promptly
opening its gates to the public on a completed show on the day and hour
originally appointed; the first to open free from mortgage or pledge of all or
some of its gate receipts; the first to make money each and every month of
the Exposition season, and the first to repay to its stockholders any considerable portion of the funds advanced by them. In these respects the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition stands without a rival."</p>

<p>CONGRESSIONAL RECOGNITION</p>

<p>A recital of the chief events of the campaign for congressional recognition
makes evident the fact that Omaha men initiated and pushed it to consummation. From the inception of the project leading spirits realized the very great
importance of getting Congress to endorse the plans and to make an appropriation to cover cost of a Government building and exhibit. The first public
meeting to consider the subject of holding an Exposition, pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Trans-Mississippi Congress, was held in the rooms of
the Commercial Club on December 22, 1895, Charles E. Weller, presiding;
and at an adjourned meeting held December 27, it was "unanimously decided
that the project of an Exposition should be carried out." It is a significant
fact that Senator William V. Allen introduced in the United States Senate, on

January 3, 1896, only a week later, a bill to "authorize and encourage the holding of a Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition at the city of Omaha,
in the year 1898, and making an appropriation therefor." The bill was
referred to a select committee on International Expositions, of which Senator

John M. Thurston was chairman. On April 10. the Senate debated, amended
and passed the bill. Three days later the Senate bill was by the House
referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and on June 6, 1896, it was
amended in the House and passed. The Senate concurring, the bill was on
the same day approved by the President. On February 17, Congressman
David H. Mercer, of Omaha, introduced a bill in the House asking for an
appropriation of $500,000, but circumstances led him and others to think that
it would be wise to push the Senate bill, which he did.</p>

<p>Leaders in both houses at first looked with disfavor upon these bills. The
bill which Congressman Mercer introduced seemed sure of death by strangulation. Representative Dingley, while not strongly opposing it, thought that
properly a provision should be attached requiring the Exposition to raise the
A sum of $500,000 before the national act should become operative. The directors of the Exposition considered this suggestion and decided that this was,
perhaps, a good proviso, for if the Government passed the bill, it would certainly be necessary to raise such an amount to insure a successful Exposition,
and the fact that the Government act required it, might help in the securing
of it. As a result the directors advised Senators Allen and Thurston and
Representative Mercer that they favored the idea, but that the amount to be
raised by the Exposition should not properly be much, if any, greater than
the Governments appropriation. It was finally agreed that the figure placed
in the bill for Government appropriation should be $250,000, and that the
Exposition be required to secure bona fide subscriptions of undoubted character,
in the sum of $250,000, before the Government act should become operative. On April 10, 1896, Senators Allen and Thurston decided to push the Senate bill, as it was becoming clear that favorable action by the Ways and

Means Committee of the House on Mr. Mercer's bill could not be counted upon
soon enough to secure passage at that session of Congress. They had the
bill called up, and after amending it, on demand of Senator Allison, to carry p
$200,000 instead of $250,000 as the bill read, it was passed by the Senate that
day. Senator Allison stated that the appropriation for Atlanta, Ga., was for
but $200,000 and he thought that sum would be sufficient for and satisfactory
to Omaha. The bill went to the House at once and Mr. Mercer soon discovered that he would have to fight to secure its passage. On the request of the
directors of the Exposition, President Wattles went to Washington to
endeavor to assist, as he might, in passage of the bill. A newspaper account of
his visit says that within fifteen minutes of his arrival at Washington, President Wattles had a conference with Congressman Mercer, when it was
determined to ask the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to call a
special meeting of his committee and to permit Messrs. Wattles and Mercer
to address it, stating the exact situation of affairs relating to the Exposition.
On April go, 1896, the Ways and Means Committee of the House made a
favorable report on the Exposition bill, tacking on the requirement that the
Exposition secure $250,000 in subscriptions in order to make valid the Congressional appropriation. President Wattles returned from Washington and
reported the status of the House and Senate bills. The directors, feeling
again the need of a special representative in Washington in order to aid Congressman Mercer in any additional way possible, requested ex-Senator Chas.
A F. Manderson and Hon. Edward Rosewater to go to Washington. Mr. Rosewater started at once on May 7, 1896; Gen. Manderson was unable to leave
the city at the time.</p>

<p>On May 10, Mr. Rosewater, in Washington, met H. Manley, of Maine,
and interested him in the Exposition bill. Mr. Manley told him that he
would do everything in his power to secure Speaker Reed's consent to bring
up the bill and place it on its passage. William Pitt Kellogg, of Louisiana,
told Mr. Rosewater that he would try to induce Speaker Reed to favor the
Exposition measure and have it acted upon at an early date. Next day Mr.
Rosewater, accompanied by Senator Gear, of Iowa, discussed with Speaker
Reed, of Maine, the features of the Exposition bill appropriating money for a
building and exhibit at Omaha, pointing out the magnitude and scope of
the Exposition and the interest felt in it throughout the West. Speaker Reed
was assured that the people all favored the measure, and he reluctantly promised that the bill should receive consideration. Passage of the bill by Congress was now felt to be assured, but vexatious obstacles prevented and annoying delays ensued, and as the session was fast drawing toward its close, the
A fear of failure was strong, and great anxiety was felt over the situation. It

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.312.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.312.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.312.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

was expected that the bill would be called up for passage early in May, and
again at several later dates in May. One obstacle after another intervened
and the anxiety grew greater, notwithstanding the able assistance of Senators
Allison and Gear of Iowa, Senators Allen and Thurston of Nebraska—of
practically the whole Iowa and Nebraska delegations and their friends. A
demand upon the Speaker for a set day met with no response. All that could
be done was to watch and wait.</p>

<p>On June 5 Mr. Mercer found his opportunity. The request for consent
to place the bill on its passage was made only to be met by objection on the
part of Omar M. Kem, sent to the House of Congress to represent the Sixth
Congressional District of Nebraska. In this case, however, he misrepresented
his constituents, as the rain of denunciatory telegrams from his district fully
attested; but, stubborn to the last, he kept up his opposition and did what he
could to obstruct the passage of the bill. On June 9, at 6:30 p. m., Mr. Mercer
again secured recognition by the Speaker, and again he was doomed to disappointment, for Mr. Bailey, of Texas, objected he said from conscientious
motives) to unanimous consent to a consideration of the bill. It now looked
like certain defeat, as Congress was scheduled to adjourn the following day;
but on June 10 recognition was again secured, and, Mr. Kem having left for
home and Mr. Bailey being absent at luncheon, unanimous consent was
obtained; the bill passed; hurried over to the Senate which body Senator
Allen had held in session purposely); the amended bill approved by the
Senate; finally engrossed and taken at once by Mr. Mercer to President Cleveland, who signed it.</p>

<p>Speaker Thomas B. Reed stated that no bill that he knew of had been so
well exploited as this one; that the bombardment of Congress was not only
courteous and of good and convincing argument, but that it had been continuous—never letting up fro m the introduction to the final passage of the bill. This was due to the ceaseless efforts of the men of Omaha, and yet without
the untiring and well-directed efforts of Hon. David H. Mercer, aided and
assisted though he was by many others, the Congressional bill would not
have passed in time to be of benefit to the Exposition.</p>

<p>The news of the passage of the Congressional bill when received at
Omaha relieved the tension of anxiety, and confidence in ultimate success prevailed generally. Congressional recognition was effected two years in advance
of the date set for opening the Exposition. The achievement was one of
incalculable benefit to the enterprise. It was evidence to members of legislatures of Western States that the Omaha Exposition would rank with other
similar enterprises, having received the sanction of Congress; it was evidence
to prospective exhibitors that the Exposition would attain a high plane of
excellence and that they could not afford to ignore it; and it was notice to the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.313.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.313.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.313.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

people all over the country that Omaha was producing all Exposition well
worthy of the patronage of sight-seers. Frequently men remarked that Congressional recognition was the turning point in the promotive work, which,
more than any other one thing, inspired popular confidence and insured success. This may have been true; but those who hold this view will not overlook the fact that the federal appropriation was predicated upon the official
assurance that the promoters of the Exposition had raised a very large cash
fund, without which Government aid would not have been extended. Moreover, the record proves conclusively that both Congressional recognition and
the raising of the subscription fund were due to the forethought, energy and 
indomitable courage of Omaha's best citizens, who thus earned and received
the larger share of credit in the popular mind for the brilliant achievement
attested by the completed Exposition.</p>

<p>Leading men in the Omaha Commercial Club regarded the action of
Congress as one of the highest importance. They suggested and arranged
for a grand civic demonstration to celebrate the event, which occurred Friday
evening, June 26, 1896. the popular support accorded to this demonstration
makes evident the fact that the people were mot only aware of the true significance of Congressional action, but that they fully appreciated the services rendered by the Omaha men whose indefatigable labors had won the confidence and support of members of Congress. A procession several miles in length, composed of many civic and military organizations, was the chief feature of
the day's program. There was booming of cannon, music by many bands and
in the evening a display of fireworks. It seemed that all the people of Omaha
and neighboring cities had turned out to take part in or to witness the celebration. The procession started at 8 p. m., commanded by Major Robert S. Wilcox, proceeding to Jefferson Square, where it disbanded. On a raised platform prominent men made brief addresses. On request of Charles F. Weller, President of the Commercial Club, President G. W. Wattles, of the Exposition, presided. With a few complimentary words he introduced Governor Silas A. Holcomb, who was greeted with applause and spoke briefly in congratulation. When Congressman recognition David H. Mercer arose to speak the people cheered long
and loud, attesting their appreciation of his tireless and successful efforts to
secure Congressional recognition. The speaker complimented the managers
and officers of the Exposition and others who ably assisted in behalf of the
Congressional bill. In conclusion he presented to President Wattles the pen
with which President Cleveland signed the Exposition bill. Senator William V.
Allen was cheered vociferously when he arose to speak. His remarks were felicitous and he specially complimented Omaha men for what they had done
in promoting the Exposition. Many letters and telegrams of regret were
read. They came from governors and senators of neighboring States, con-

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.314.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.314.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.314.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

gressmen
 and other men of prominence of Iowa, South Dakota, Wyoming and
Nebraska. Among them was a letter from Senator John M. Thurston. After
a brief address by former Governor Robert W. Eurnas, of Brownville, the
orator of the occasion, John N. Baldwin, of Council Bluffs, was introduced.
He delivered an eloquent address, which was received with great enthusiasm.
Gen. Charles F. Manderson spoke next, addressing complimentary remarks to
those who had been instrumental in passing the bill, referring not only to members of Congress, but to officers of the Exposition and also to the men of
Omaha who had assisted. J. H. Van Dusen was introduced. He gave assurance of South Omaha's great interest in the Exposition. Hon. John Doniphan,
Vice-President for Missouri, was the last speaker. The great audience
adjourned with "three ringing cheers and a tiger" for the Exposition and its promoters in Omaha and in Congress.</p>

<p>The act of Congress gave the project great impetus all along the line.
In view of the enthusiasm engendered, the management determined that the
scope of the work should be broadened and, in furtherance of this object, to
appeal to the business men of Omaha for earnest co-operation. Accordingly,
a meeting of merchants and citizens was called for June 18, 1896, at the Commercial Club rooms. The rooms were packed with enthusiastic citizens.
Cheering speeches were made, and a resolution was adopted pledging hearty
support of the business men and capitalists of Omaha to the active promoters
of the Exposition. The expressions of sentiment heard at this meeting were
representative of popular opinion throughout the city. Omaha was stirred
from center to circumference by the success of the undertaking up to that time
and the people were determined to lend aid in every possible way. There had
never been a more positive expression of the Omaha spirit than that which
found voice in the citizens' meeting of June 18-nearly two years prior to the
date contemplated for the opening day. The encouragement it gave to the
officers and managers of the Exposition amounted to an in spiration. There
was evident a desire among all classes of citizens to further the project to the
utmost. So earnest was this popular sentiment that success seemed then to
be assured. From that day to the end the people of Omaha were as one in
promoting all measures looking to the success of the Exposition. Without
this persistent and loyal co-operation upon the part of Omaha the great difficulties which confronted the managers and officers from time to time could not
have been overcome. A consideration of all the forces contributing to the
ultimate success of the project must lead to the conclusion that Omaha's part
in the great work was paramount, which means that the greater share of the
credit for the glorious achievement must be accorded to the able, efficient and
public-spirited men of the Nebraska metropolis.</p>

<p>A LADIES' BUREAU OF ENTERTAINMENT</p>

<p>In another chapter reference is made to the important part taken by the
women of Omaha in helping to entertain the distinguished guests of the city
and especially the wives of such visitors during the Exposition season. In
order to systematize this branch of the work it was decided to organize a
Bureau of Entertainment, consisting entirely of ladies. In this plan the President of the Exposition was influenced somewhat by the success attained by
the management of the Columbian Exposition of 1893, where it was found to be absolutely necessary to enlist the co-operation of leading society women in extending to honored guests the hospitable attention their rank and station suggested or required. Such an organization of local women had made itself indispensable at the Nashville Exposition. It was found that by means of subcommittees, chosen as occasion required, arrangements could be made at any moment for the entertainment of small parties of visitors; while the whole committee was summoned whenever larger groups of distinguished guests

most brilliant entertainments of the summer. The activities of this bureau
made a highly favorable impression upon the guests of the Exposition,
particularly upon those from the East, who were very appreciative of the steps
taken to make their visits pleasant. The governors of nearly all the Western
States and their staffs, together with their ladies, were shown attentions upon
their visits; and in many ways the Bureau of Entertainment was found to fit
in admirably with the functions of other branches of the Exposition.</p>

<p>THE UPLIFT</p>

<p>It is the consensus of opinion among the business men of Omaha that
the Exposition gave to the city a very great uplift, whose far-reaching benefits are felt up to this time. Well-known leaders in various lines of business were requested to express themselves on the subject, and they responded as follows:</p>

<p>Casper E. Yost, President of the Nebraska Telephone Company, said:</p>

<p>It has been my pleasure to witness the growth of Omaha for a generation—to note the advent of forces which gave it momentum and the successive strides made by the city in its race for commercial supremacy. The historian has chronicled some of the great events in the early history of our city which were vital factors in the work of laying permanent;

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Feature of Floral Display</p>
 
</div>

foundations, but in my opinion none gave to it a higher impulse than the brilliant success of the Exposition of 1898. We had a good city at that time, to be sure, but its vitality was sorely drained by a season of drouth which was common to all Western States. the effect of which fell upon us coincident with the financial panic of 1893, for whose origin Nebraska was in nowise responsible. Omaha, like other Western towns, was hard hit. Financial disturbances in the East stopped the natural trend of money into the West, while our corn fields were parched and burned by hot winds in successive seasons of protracted drouth. As a city we were caught between the upper and nether millstones. Our business was prostrated and our realty values were badly impaired. These conditions were brought upon us through no fault of our people.</p>

<p>The Exposition was suggested in the fall of 1895 and a few months thereafter was launched by our public-spirited men who pledged themselves to make it a success. Many of our people expressed the opinion that Omaha could not carry out such a gigantic enterprise under such discouraging conditions. But it was done, and the task looks bigger and more praiseworthy as we contemplate it today than it did then. Its great success proved to us all and to the people of the whole country that Omaha possessed a large store

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.321.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.321.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.321.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of vitality and material strength despite the effects of panic and drouth; and that we had among us men of extraordinary ability and power. This was a revelation to the people of the East, and raised the reputation of the city as nothing had ever done before. Ever since the Exposition, Omaha has been drawing dividends on her investment in it, and, in my opinion, it was one of the best investments our people ever made.</p>

<p>Charles H. Pickens, General Manager of Paxton &amp; Gallagher Co., said:</p>

<p>At the time of the Exposition, Omaha had been for several years in a very unsatisfactory condition, both commercially and financially. The Exposition, which was promoted and practically financed by a handful of Omaha's prominent citizens, erected and conducted an exhibition which attracted attention not only throughout the Central West, but practically throughout the United States, and was largely attended by people of the East who at that time had no idea or conception of the possibilities of the country. Many located here and others interested capital, causing it to be invested here.</p>

<p>The Exposition was held at the time of the Spanish-American War, which distracted the
popular mind for a few months. Notwithstanding this interruption, the Exposition proved

to be a wonderful success, not only educationally, but financially, being the only one held in the United States which paid back to stockholders practically dollar for dollar. This speaks worlds for the management and support of Omaha citizens, to say nothing of the liberal support given the enterprise by people in the territory tributary to Omaha.</p>

<p>Ever since the Exposition, Omaha has been steadily forging to the front, until today
it is recognized as one of the leading commercial centers of the country. To a very large extent the growth and development of this community were due to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition and the ability, integrity and loyalty of the citizens who promulgated and carried on the great enterprise.</p>

<p>F. P. Kirkendall, manufacturer, said:</p>

<p>In my opinion, the Exposition was of incalculable benefit to Omaha. It occurred at a
time when our community needed awakening from an apparent dormant condition it
was then in. It awakened new life in our citizens and gave them more faith in the future
of our city and our resources. and started a healthy prosperity which has continued ever since.</p>

<p>We built the Exposition at a time when the whole country was passing through a period
of depression which tended to create some doubt in the minds of many of our prominent
citizens of the ultimate success of the undertaking, while, on the other hand, we were
benefited by the fact of the prevailing apathy throughout the country at the time, in that we were able to make our money go farther both in material and labor.</p>

<p>The Exposition brought thousands of strangers to our city who were astonished, amused
and impressed with our undertaking and success. In this way we were building for the future, perhaps, more than we realized. The record made by the first Exposition held in Omaha will always be remembered as one of the most successful ever held in this country, and of great benefit to the entire West.</p>

<p>Luther Drake, President of the Merchants National Bank, said:</p>

<p>The Exposition of 1898 was the turning point in Omaha's commercial career. The
whole West had suffered for five years from the effects of the panic of 1893 and the
droughts of 1894 and '95, and the great cities had very naturally sustained severe losses, owing to the depressed business conditions and impaired real estate values. Omaha was no worse off in that respect than her compeers. The Exposition proved to the country that Omaha was built on such a safe foundation that, notwithstanding the depression of years, it was still strong enough to formulate and conduct a great project to a brilliant consummation. It brought the attention of people East and West to this city. They realized that the men of Omaha were made of the material that has enabled mankind to subdue the wilderness and make it produce great wealth. The success of the Exposition caused investors to single Omaha out as a good place in which to put their money, a result which its promoters sought from the beginning to attain.</p>

<p>Henry W. Yates, President of the Nebraska National Bank, said:</p>

<p>In reply to the request of the history committee of the Omaha Exposition of 1898 for
some brief expression of my views concerning the ways in which the Exposition benefited
Omaha, I would say on first impulse that the greatest benefit it conferred was in being
a success.</p>

<p>When the enterprise was inaugurated it occasioned considerable fear and foreboding
with many, and, to my certain knowledge, especially with some of those whose financial
backing was absolutely required to give the project any substantial standing.</p>

<p>The action of these men under the circumstances was the most splendid exhibition of
civic patriotism that has ever come under my observation.</p>

<p>The success was mainly due to the fact that our most prominent business men ignored,
for the time being, the strenuous demands of their personal enterprises to take charge
of the different departments of the Exposition.</p>

<p>The period was a critical one, closely following, as it did, the panic year of 1893 and the bad crop years of 1894 and 1895, but proved in the end to be auspicious.</p>

<p>The outcome of the political campaign of 1896 in laying to rest the financial heresies which flourished during the period of depression led to a great business revival all over the country.</p>

<p>Doubtless Omaha business would have shared in this recovery—Exposition or no
Exposition—but its successful conclusion conduced in no small degree to the alacrity with which our business men took advantage of the situation.</p>

<p>One of the greatest benefits of the Exposition was the fact that our business men were brought closer together, became better acquainted with each other, and learned to work together, "one for all and all for one," a habit which has continued to the present time.</p>

<p>I do not know of any greater guaranty for the future prosperity of Omaha than the
existence of this spirit among those who carry the fate of the city in their hands. and for the creation of this alone, the Exposition has well justified its existence.</p>

<p>L. H. Korty, former superintendent of telegraph, Union Pacific Railway,
said:</p>

<p>Conceived at a time when Omaha, like many other towns, was in the dumps, the proposed exposition was looked upon by many well-meaning citizens as a very hazardous undertaking which, if it failed of success, would seriously reflect upon the city. The result, however, proved everything that could have been wished. The enterprise and ability of its promoters to establish and carry the Exposition to a successful termination was a surprise to visitors as well as to Omaha people themselves. It forcibly demonstrated to our citizens that concerted action in all matters looking toward the upbuilding of Omaha is of the greatest importance, and there can be no doubt but that the lesson from this undertaking has been of great benefit, and gave our people the inspiration and determination which have accomplished so much during the past few years in the upbuilding of the city and its numerous enterprises. </p>

<p>The Exposition proved very interesting and satisfactory to the visitors. While not
as pretentious as some of its predecessors, it was very attractive in its general arrangement and character of exhibits. The setting of the main buildings was charming, and was still further enhanced by the master hand of one of Omaha's sons—Henry Rustin. The beautiful electric effects produced by him had never been equaled.</p>

<p>Altogether, I believe the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, as an advertisement, was one
of the best investments ever made by our citizens.</p>

<p>W. E. Wright, of the Wright &amp; Wilhelmy Company, said:</p>

<p>That the Exposition of 1898 was the beginning of an upward and forward movement—affecting every branch of business—that has never ceased, is an unquestioned fact. The important point to me is not the effect but the cause—the courage, the energy and the persistency of the projectors of this great movement who, in the face of conditions that prevailed for three years previous, conceived, organized, developed and brought to a successful issue one of the most notable Expositions ever held.</p>

<p>May the honor and credit to which they are entitled be given them by the present generation rather than by the succeeding ones.</p>

<p>Isaac W. Carpenter, President of the Carpenter Paper Company, said: </p>

<p>In my judgment the chief benefits Omaha derived from the Trans-Mississippi Exposition were:</p>

<p>First—The wide advertisement Omaha received therefrom.</p>

<p>Second—The uniting of our citizens of all classes in one great successful public enterprise, thereby greatly strengthening the faith of our citizens in their own city.</p>

<p>Third—The development of some great leaders among us, which was done by the large
demands upon the resourcefulness of the President and Executive Committee.</p>

<p>Fourth—The impetus it gave our city in a material way by the completing of two much-needed railway passenger stations, by the entrance of one new railroad into Omaha, and by raising the public estimate of our city, its citizens and its business institutions all over the United States, but particularly from the Great Lakes west to the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>E. V. Lewis, General Manager of the Crane Co., said:</p>

<p>The Exposition of 1898 was the starting-point of our commercial development. It
unified the people of our city and State. It gave an impulse to local business. Far and
wide it drew attention to Omaha, and the people of the State got a better idea of what
we could do. It increased the respect of our people for the business men of our own

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.325.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.325.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.325.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

community, and at the same time confirmed the faith of these men in their ability to do
things worth while and to meet any situation that might arise in the development of our
city and State.</p>

<p>Ward M. Burgess, Vice-President of M. E. Smith &amp; Co., wholesale dry
goods, said:</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Exposition gave Omaha an uplift. Our books show that we
enjoyed an increase of trade during the year of the Exposition of 25 per cent over and above the year before. much of which was undoubtedly due to the Exposition, which gave Omaha a great impetus. We have all kept on growing, and a great deal of the city's growth is due to the Exposition of 1898. It started people to coming to Omaha, and they have been coming ever since. It made the people friendly—they came from all sections. Many who had never come before have come repeatedly. It caused them to appreciate the fact that Omaha was a big city and could do big things. It gave Omaha a better standing in the East among people with whom we do business. It opened their eyes to the fact that we were alive and aggressive; that we had confidence in ourselves and our community. More than anything else the Exposition had to do with bringing our business men together into a big, harmonious body, and since the Exposition they have worked together for our best interests. This has done us more good than anything else. A better spirit prevails among our people, which is necessary in strengthening the commercial interests of the city.</p>

<p>Major R. S. Wilcox, Manager for Browning, King &amp; Co., said:</p>

<p>The Exposition was the making of Omaha. It was the first big thing we had had.
There is no question it helped the retail trade of the city. In one month our house sold out one complete stock. We were swamped with business. Other retail houses shared in the
unusual trade. The Exposition attracted trade from surrounding towns for successive years. Even to this day one may hear talk about the Exposition in those towns. It was the best investment Omaha ever made.</p>

<p>C. M. Wilhelm, of Orchard &amp; Wilhelm Carpet Company, said:</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Exposition was an inspiration to the people of Omaha and
Nebraska. Following the great panic of 1893 and its disastrous results, the effect of the  undertaking was to stimulate local business, to give the people of Omaha confidence in themselves and to attract the admiration of the country at large for the enterprise shown by this community. The impetus given. to business in the building and carrying forward of the Exposition had an influence in placing Omaha firmly in the column of advancing cities.</p>

<p>It was an opportunity, grasped by men capable of making it a great success, both as
a commercial enterprise, advertising the city to the utmost parts of the world, and as a
means of broadening the knowledge and developing the tastes of the people.</p>

<p>Rome Miller, Proprietor of the Hotel Rome, said:</p>

<p>Expressing my opinion of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, held in Omaha in 1898, i
bearing on the subject of the benefits derived from it, would say the benefits accrued were not only for Omaha and the State of Nebraska, but the entire West.</p>

<p>It found us a thriving village, and left us a metropolis. It tolled the bell of new life and confidence, and its echoes have been vibrating with increased power from the date of its close to the present moment. </p>

<p>It was the beginning of a greater Omaha, stimulating, as it did, the civic pride, and taught its citizens love for music and art, such as they had never possessed. </p>

<p>It fostered a unity of action and good fellowship among its business men which have been of untold benefit to Omaha and the State.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.326.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.326.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.326.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>From the publicity standpoint, nothing equaled it in the past, and nothing can equal
it in the future. It gave us prestige, credit; it was all good, elevating and instructive, and nothing destructive. Too much praise can not be given to the men who guided its destinies and brought it to its fitting close of triumph and glory.</p>

<p>G. H. Payne, President of the Payne Investment Company, said:</p>

<p>In regard to the effect that the Omaha Exposition of '98 had on Omaha, would say
that, in my judgment, it was just the thing that we needed to advertise the resources of the great State of Nebraska and Central West at the most opportune time that it could have possibly been held. It crystallized and made possible the Omaha of today and the still greater Omaha of the future.</p>

<p>Charles R. Sherman, of the Sherman &amp; McConnell Drug Company, said:</p>

<p>"Omaha's best friends will not deny that its commercial tide had ebbed to low-water
mark during the' few years previous to 1898. The unprecedented droughts, continuing
through several years and extending to a greater or lesser degree throughout the entire
Trans-Mississippi territory, had impaired agricultural production so seriously that the
country merchant was, in many instances, in financial straits, through lack of ability to pay on the part of his farmer customer; while, in turn, Omaha's wholesalers and manufacturers had suffered financial loss through failures of country merchants.</p>

<p>The prospect of a great Exposition that would attract hundreds of thousands of
people from all parts of the United States, but more especially from the Trans-Mississippi States, seemed at first too good to be true, but the strong, earnest men behind the project gave assurance, from the first, of its success.</p>

<p>The effect upon the entire commercial life of Omaha was immediately apparent. Long
before the gates were opened in the Spring of 1898, the feeble and uncertain pulse of
Omaha's commercial life took on a new tone and became strong and regular. The influx
of Exposition builders during the year 1897. was an intimation of what might be expected
when the Exposition was opened and the city thronged. with visitors. The Exposition itself. opening on time and under most favorable auspices, silenced all doubters. The immediate effect was the pouring of hundreds of thousands of dollars into all channels of trade in this city.</p>

<p>The visitors to the Exposition were, in the main, residents of the States naturally tributary to Omaha, and were not slow in availing themselves of the opportunity to make purchases of Omaha's merchants, the result being that the retail stores were crowded with shoppers, while the wholesale merchants and manufacturers noticed a remarkable increase in the number of country buyers in town.</p>

<p>While the immediate effect of all this was invaluable, and, in many instances, all that saved some retail and wholesale institutions from going to the wall altogether, the lasting effects have been of much more value.</p>

<p>In thousands of instances the visit to the Exposition was also the first trip to Omaha, and the courteous and pleasant treatment extended by the Exposition management as well as the hospitable attitude of the Omaha homes, made the Exposition visitor resolve that he would come to Omaha again.</p>

<p>That he has been coming is evidenced by the continuous growth and prosperity of
Omaha during all the years since the Exposition, as well as the much closer friendship that has grown between the people of this city and its rural citizenry.</p>

<p>THE CURTAIN FALLS</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI</p>

<p>THE last ceremonial act incident to the Exposition was the
awarding of the honor medals to the President and
to each member of the Executive Committee, which
occurred September 10, 1902. This award was provided for a meeting of the Board of Directors at the Omaha Club, June 30, 1902,
when one of the directors, John C. Wharton, moved that a
committee of three be named by Secretary Wakefield (the latter
to be chairman) to select and secure gold medals to be presented
to the President and to each member of the Executive Committee
in token of the high regard entertained by the Board of Directors, and
in recognition of honorable and self-sacrificing services to the Exposition.
The motion was carried unanimously. Mr. Wakefield named
G. M. Hitchcock and John C. Wharton to act with as such committee. As soon as practicable, the committee proceeded to ask
for designs and bids, which were submitted after some delay. After
changes suggested by the committee had been made the contract was let and
the medals were delivered in the early fall.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the action of the Board of Directors, Secretary Wakefield
called a special meeting in behalf of the committee of Award, which was held
in room 130, Millard Hotel, at noon, Wednesday, September 10, 1902. 
In this room hundreds of meetings of the Executive Committee had been held, and because of this fact it was chosen for the place of formal presentation of the medals. There were present as guests of the special committee, President Wattles, Chairman Lindsey ad Messrs. Rosewater, Kirkendall, Bruce, Reed and Babcock.</p>

<p>After luncheon had been served, G. M. Hitchcock rose and addressed the members of the party. Referring to his appointment as a member of the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.329.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.329.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.329.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

committee on award of medals, he said he had not hesitated to assume the
pleasant duties involved. He said that the committee represented not only
the sentiments of the directory, but also those of over six thousand stockholders and people of the whole community. "These directors, these stockholders and this community generally tender you gentlemen, in this little
souvenir, a slight recognition of your honorable, able and self-sacrificing
services covering ·a period of several years. The President and each member of this committee who became the head of an important department of
the Exposition laid down for a time the burdens and ambitions of private
life and took up the burdens and responsibilities of public service. You came
to the relief of this community when men of courage and ability were needed,
and patiently, persistently, in the face of discouragements and in spite of the
greatest obstacles, you, as the responsible officers of this great undertaking,
worked it out, not to an ordinary success, but to a miraculous achievement.
When the Exposition was closed. viewed in the light of all past expositions.
it had been a wonderful success, financially and artistically. * * * Each of
you was at the head of a great department of this large enterprise. Each of
you at one time or another bore the brunt of the struggle. At one time it
fell upon the department of exhibits; at another time upon the department of
concessions and privileges; at another time upon the department of transportation; at another time upon the department of buildings and grounds; at
another time upon the department of publicity and promotion, and we painfully remember how frequently it fell upon the department of ways and
means. Each officer sustained his part and fulfilled his duties individually;
and when the Executive Committee met and the heads of all departments
were united the committee spoke as one man and exercised the great power
of the Exposition with substantial harmony and effect. Had a single department failed, or had the head of a single department faltered, the great enterprise would have been seriously damaged. But the patience, persistence.

splendid result. I am sure, however, that no member of the Executive Committee would question for a moment the propriety of my remarks when I
particularly specify the great services of the President of this Exposition.

r of the head of each department, fulfilling the duty of each in his temporary
absence; and who, in season and out of season, subordinated and sacrificed
his personal interests and his private affairs that a great Exposition of which
he was the head might succeed. Had failure come we cannot question that
upon the shoulders of the President would have been placed much of the
responsibility for disaster, simply from the fact that he occupied first place in

the organization. Therefore, in the day of its great and final success, and
in the awarding to you, gentlemen, of these mementos of the long fight and
great triumph, it is but proper to give first place to the President, who worked
with you so effectively."</p>

<p>The speaker called upon John C. Wharton to make formal delivery of
the medals prepared by authority of the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Mr. Wharton said in part: "It is a pleasant duty enjoined by the Board
of Directors of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of presenting golden medals
to you, Mr. President, and to you gentlemen constituting the Executive Committee of the Board, as an expression of its high appreciation, and that of the
public as well, for the faithful, unselfish and efficient services rendered by you
in carrying to a successful culmination a stupendous enterprise. * * * You
moved nobly forward, nothing daunting your courage or impeding your
efforts, bringing forth ·a splendid exhibit of the products of the Northwest
placed in buildings of marvelous architectural beauty! * * You brought
to perfection the mighty project committed to your hands. You labored
long and well. You sacrificed your own business interests, leaving the
management of your banking and financial institutions, wholesale houses
and daily journals, demonstrating to the people your patriotism and loyalty
for the public good. * * *</p>

<p>"By direction of the Board of Directors of the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition, I have the honor of presenting to you, President
Wattles, and to you, Messrs. Lindsey, Rosewater, Kirkendall, Bruce, Reed
and Babcock, these beautiful gold medals (handing to each, in turn, a medal),
as a slight token of our high appreciation of the faithful, efficient and heroic
services rendered by you in bringing to such a glorious culmination the
industrial Exposition of 1898. Your success was not merely an artistic, but
it was also a financial, success, returning as you did ninety cents on the dollar
to stockholders; and that, too, at a time when industrial paralysis and financial
depression were sweeping over the commercial world like the simoon of the
desert, blighting trade and deadening enterprise. Yet in the midst of all this
you triumphed—triumphed because of the personal sacrifices you made;
because of your unswerving honesty in the management of the undertaking, and
your unalterable determination to crown with glorious success a gigantic
enterprise. * * * We present these medals, not for their intrinsic value,
but in testimony of regard and appreciation. Let them be kepi by you.

<p>The medals were products of the best goldsmiths' art, about four inches
in length by 1 3-4. inches wide; 14-k gold. The face bore a figure of Victory,
wings and arms outstretched, standing at the portal of the Hall of Fame. The
right hand held a horseshoe wreath of laurel leaves; in the left hand there
was a scroll bearing the sentence: "Gloria actiones Cinxit" (Glory surrounds

his conduct). Near the top or edge of the medal, in raised letters, was the
word "Omaha." Below the figure of winged victory, in blue enamel, were
the words: "Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, 1898." On
the reverse side were engraved in script the words: "Unanimously voted
by the Board of Directors in Appreciation of Honorable and Self-Sacrificing
Services to the Exposition." The medal proper hung pendant below two
bars, on the topmost of which appeared name of recipient, and on the lower
bar was engraved the word "President," or "Executive Committee," as the
case required.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.332.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.332.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.332.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>After the recipients had examined the medals and passed appreciative
comments thereon, Chairman Lindsey called upon President Wattles to make
response to the presentation addresses. The latter said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Presentation Committee, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Executive Committee:</p>

<p>"A feeling of sadness comes over me as we meet for the last time in
this familiar room to receive these beautiful medals and listen to the words
of praise and commendation so lavishly expressed by the Presentation Committee. For myself and for the Executive Committee, I thank you most
heartily, and through you I thank the Board of Directors for this appropriate
expression of their esteem and appreciation. W e will each of us value these
beautiful medals beyond price, and through our lives they will be preserved
as reminders of the confidence and good will of our fellow workers in an
enterprise fraught with many difficulties but crowned with unparalleled success.</p>

<p>"It was almost seven years ago that the first steps were taken in the
preliminary work of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition,
and those first efforts were difficult in many respects. Many prominent business men in the community not only refused their support but ridiculed the
enterprise and those connected with it. Those were dark days and it took
great moral courage to pull against the tide of public opinion, which seemed
to hesitate at so great an undertaking.</p>

<p>"It was nearly five years ago that this Executive Committee was organized and began its meetings in this room. Here has been the scene of many
heated arguments, and here have been settled many of the vital questions
which meant so much for the success or failure of the enterprise. How well
these questions were settled the final success tells the story. As I look back on
the many differences of opinion and on some of the unpleasant experiences, I
sometimes wonder if they were not all for the best, and I believe but for these
differences we might have made many mistakes we avoided. I have heard our
plan of organization criticised, and at times during the Exposition I questioned
whether or not it was the best. This plan of dividing the responsibility among
several heads of departments was proposed by myself, as I was willing and
anxious to distribute the burdens, and I am now willing to divide the honors
equally between myself and the members of this committee. The only additional credit I claim is on account of longer service. I took up the work as a
public duty and simply did my best at all times and under all circumstances.
Each member of the Executive Committee did the same, and as I now look
back on what was accomplished, I do not think the plan of organization could
have been improved.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.333.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.333.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.333.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"As we meet for the last time as a committee to receive these honors so
generously bestowed, I can say with a heart filled with gratitude to this
Presentation Committee, that we thank you again for your kind words and
for these beautiful medals, and to the members of the Executive Committee,
I wish you one and all prosperity and happiness throughout your lives."</p>

<p>PROCEEDINGS OF SPECIAL DAYS</p>

<p>PART II</p>

<p>PART I of this History has been devoted to what may be
termed the History proper, eliminating the details which
would make the narrative less interesting as such.
Part II will present to the reader a feast of reason and flow
of soul, for which the Exposition was noted. It has been stated
in Part I that the success of the Exposition was partly due to the
thoughtful arrangements on the part of the management for
special days, frequently interspersed with the routine, by which
the people of the entire nation were made to feel that they had
a personal interest in the Exposition. In the rotation of these special
days, representative men and organizations from all parts of the land were
brought into the presence of the visitors, and the addresses delivered
upon subjects purely social and economic, politics being eliminated, would
have graced any forum. It is to the recording of the proceedings of
these special days, and the addresses delivered in connection with them,
that Part II of this History is devoted.</p>

<p>First in the order of historic events of the Exposition, though occurring
more than a year previous to the opening of the gates, was the</p>

<p>LAYING OF THE CORNERSTONE OF THE ARCH OF THE STATES.</p>

<p>ARBOR DAY—April 22, 1897</p>

<p>An outline of the exercises and the program of the day were given an appropriate place in Chapter III, Part I. The address of Hon. J. Sterling Morton, of
Nebraska City, Nebr., ex-Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, on
that memorable occasion was as follows:</p>

<p>"In the wisdom of His creative majesty the great Mysteriarch of the universe
surrounded man with mysteries. Without such environment there would have
I been no incentive to thought, no inducement to investigation. The life and growth
of a blade of grass, the development of a rose, or the evolution of a great oak from
an acorn alike suggests the unknown, the miraculous and the unsolved.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.337.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.337.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.337.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"In 1854 the pioneers of Nebraska made the first lodgement of modern civilization upon the vast, undulating ocean of fertile lands which stretched in solitude
from the west bank of the Missouri River toward the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>"At the point of the plow they have compelled the prairies of Nebraska to
deliver up, during the last forty-one years, thirty-six abundant crops, some of
them almost miraculous in yield. During that period of time, in remote frontier
portions of the commonwealth, there have been some failures, or partial failures, of

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>J. Sterling Morton</p>
 
</div>

crops from drouth and grasshoppers. But in the
eastern portion of Nebraska there may be found
hundreds of farms which, since 1855, have never
once failed to remunerate intelligent tillage with
substantial rewards. The men who legitimately,
steadfastly and discreetly have trusted to the plow
and intelligent farming in the first settled sections
of Nebraska since 1885 are, as a rule, successful
men, not mortgaged nor in financial straits. There
is no part of the United States which can exhibit
from its first cultivation a crop record equal in
annual yield to that which eastern Nebraska is
proud to exhibit from the day when agriculture
first put its autograph upon the prairie with the
point of the plow, down to the autumn of 1896
when the sun shone and the winds played among
the cornfields in this commonwealth, which produced more than two hundred
millions of bushels. Nebraska is prepared with statistics, figures and facts to
prove that during the last forty years no State in the Union has surpassed
it in the regularity and abundance of its crops. Thus far, however, we have
only demonstrated that the elements of plant life and growth, which were
primarily absorbed by the wild grasses and flowers, are now appropriated and
utilized by corn, oats, barley, rye, wheat and a variety of root and other food
crops. The summer and autumn sunlight which formerly only bronzed prairie
grass now gilds the grain fields, burnishes ripening fruit and matures ample
rewards in varied products for intelligent toil.</p>

<p>"But after the demonstration of the plow as to the fertility of Nebraska
another problem demanded solution. The home builders in this new country
desired the embellishment of the plains by woodlands and forests, and the question as to how it should be accomplished and as to whether forests would thrive
in these soils compelled earnest and analytical investigation. Consequently, after
much experimentation, much of individual exhortation and effort, there was
evolved out of the shadeless plains and from the utter desolation of treelessness,
a plan for unanimous tree planting on a given Clay by all the people in all the
counties of all the commonwealth. And the plan took root like a strong and
valuable tree. Its growth today reaches out into all the States of the American
republic. It has been grafted upon the school system of the entire country. It

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.338.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.338.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.338.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

has been transported to European countries which are carefully cherishing it. In
Mexico, Australia, and in some of the far-away islands of the oceans and seas, it
is permanently established as an anniversary, and everywhere it is recognized a
and welcomed as a child of Nebraska.</p>

<p>"In all the timbered States of the East, and in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio;
in fact, in each of the heavily wooded sections of the United States, vast areas
of trees were unnecessarily cut down and the logs, even of valuable oaks, walnuts
and other cabinet woods, thoughtlessly, uselessly transmitted to smoke and ashes.
How few of the axmen, the tree-slayers, who kindled those disastrous conflagrations, realized that the flames which they evolved were merely stolen sunlight set
free, enfranchised. The mystery of the life of a great and aged tree is a majesty
compared to which that of human royalty is tame, puerile and insignificant. From
our earliest childhood we are taught that fire and water will not mix, but in the
tree they mingle as friends and co-laborers. With its foliage, which are its lungs, 
the tree breathes in the rain and the light. Every sunbeam which it inhales is
imprisoned only to be freed by combustion. The water and the fire are married
and dwell interdependently in all the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>"Like vast, disciplined armies, the forests of the American continent stood
guard over the fertility of the lands and the health and lives of all the animal
creation which they protected. With their foliage of emerald and the whispering
winds, those great stretches of wooded land lured the light of the sun, the moisture
of the clouds to their hearts and made them hostages, pledges against flood, drouth
and the disease which those calamities create. But man's wanton wastefulness
of the superb woods of the United States has dried up thousands of springs of
delicious drinking water, parched out beautiful brooks and useful mill streams,
destroyed the pliant and absorbing leaf mould of the forest, which was the arrester
and custodian of torrential rainfalls and the mother of rills and streams.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that each stratum of rocks and minerals is a grave, a great
tomb, wherein myriads of centuries ago were buried the remnants of animal and
vegetable kind? When woodlands, forest trees, shall have all been destroyed,
together with subsidiary vegetation, every living thing will have perished from the
face of the earth. Has this globe at some time in the unknowable, prehistoric
past, subsisted a race which destroyed its forests, and then, as a penalty, perished?
Is the present tenantry of this earth destined to destroy all its forests and trees
and thus commit universal suicide? The intermission of the foliage, flower and
fruit of a single summer would bring upon every human being, upon all animal
organisms, an overwhelming avalanche of death.</p>

<p>"This is a stupendous truth. It admonishes mankind that their physical and
sanitary protection is in the trees and forests, which conserve the rainfall, mitigate
the heat of the sun and make possible the continuation of animal life and the
perpetuation of that civilization which exalts and ennobles the human race.</p>

<p>"A truth and a tree outlive generations of men. That this admirably planned
Trans-Mississippi Exposition may plant truths as to the economic and material if
resources of its vast and opulent empire in the minds of the tens of thousands

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.339.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.339.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.339.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of intelligent visitors and sojourners who may attend it, with as cheerful a certainty and as serene a satisfaction as we experience in planting these trees in the
never-deceiving, never-disappointing soil of this fertile Nebraska, is my earnest
hope and my sincere and intense desire."</p>

<p>The following letters were received and read at a banquet tendered to Honorable Sterling Morton at the Omaha Club, April 22, 1897, Arbor Day, the date
of the laying of the cornerstone of the Arch of the States.</p>

<p>The following letter of regret from ex-President Grover Cleveland was
read:</p>

<p>PRINCETON, N. J., April 16, 1897.</p>

<p>Hon. W. D. McHugh, Omaha.</p>

<p>MY DEAR SIR: I very much regret that my other engagements will not permit me to
attend the complimentary dinner to be given to the Hon. J. Sterling Morton by his fellow-
citizens April 22.</p>

<p>The people of Nebraska do themselves honor in thus honoring this distinguished citizen of their State. He deserves honor from his countrymen everywhere for his unfaltering devotion to their interests and his brave resistance to every attack upon the honor and integrity of his country.</p>

<p>With the best possible means of estimating the value of his public services, I recall
with greatest satisfaction and gratitude his earnest discharge of duty and his solicitude for the public good during a time when time-servers faltered and fell by the wayside.</p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p>GROVER CLEVELAND.</p>

<p>The following letter from Hon. Richard Olney was read:</p>

<p>BOSTON, April 16, 1897.</p>

<p>Hon. W. D. McHugh.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR: I have the invitation of the committee, given through you, to be present on
April 22 at a complimentary dinner tendered by his friends to the ex-Secretary of Agriculture, Hon. J. Sterling Morton.</p>

<p>It would give me great pleasure to attend if it were within my power. Having
been drawn into close relations with Mr. Morton during the past four years, am not
prepared to yield, even to his friends and fellow-citizens of Nebraska, either in admiration of him as an official or in regard for him as a man. Nebraska has a right to be proud of him as a cabinet minister of rare ability and thorough disinterestedness whose valuable services, by no means limited to his own special department, have laid the whole country under lasting obligations.</p>

<p>Regretting that I must forego so agreeable an occasion. I remain,</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>RICHARD OLNEY.</p>

<p>Letters from Hon. Henry Watterson, editor of the Louisville <em class="hi">Courier-Journal</em>, Hon. John P. Irish, the California orator; Hon. John G. Carlisle, ex-Secretary of the Treasury, and Mr. Carl Morton, son of the honored guest, were read at
the banquet.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.340.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.340.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.340.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The remarks of Gen. Charles F. Manderson in response, were received
with marked appreciation by the banqueters. The General said, in part:</p>

<p>In response to the toast "Our Guest," at this banquet;</p>

<p>"One of the earliest recollections of my childhood is of a giant tree, in the
place of my nativity, on the bank of a majestic river, which took its placid course
to the near sea. It stood alone in its vigorous strength and attractive beauty,
the joy of all who looked upon it, the pride of those who claimed in it a possessory
right. It had braved the blasts of many winters and had withstood the attack
of the thunderbolt and the electric Hash. Occasionally it would be smitten by the
one and blasted by the other, but it seemed to come out of every conflict with
better powers and greater vigor of life and rapidity of growth. Its massive roots
had taken deep hold of the earth of its home, its footing made the more secure
by tendrils that took grasp of the hidden rock and buried stone. Its mighty trunk,
gnarled and seamed, had borne the incision of many a knifeblade of generations
of men, who felt the inscription of initial, or of name, might add to their fame
through the force of the mere association. Its spreading boughs had formed the
bowered home of many a sweet singing bird, which reared its young and sent them
forth into the world with untried wing. Its leafy canopy had sheltered man and
beast from the wilting sun and the destroying storm. Towering above all surroundings it was a landmark to guide the wanderer. With verdure clad, it
gladdened the sight. It stood as a beneficence. Its life was a benefaction. Its
memory a benediction.</p>

<p>"The recollection of it came to me most vividly today as I listened at the
Exposition grounds to the appropriate words of our guest on the subject of forestry. It was fitting recollection for Arbor Day and most fitting for the birthday of
the strong, vigorous, aggressive, many-sided, sterling man who honors us with his
presence. It symbolizes his life, and surely no better symbol could be found or one
more appropriate to the founder of Arbor Day, than one of that great Arboreal
family that through generations yet to come will bend their tall and graceful
heads to make grateful acknowledgment and willing obeisance to the virtues and
memory of the man whose fertile and prolific brain conceived the best possible plan
for their fostering and preservation. All hail to the founder of the most promising of all our holidays! All others commemorate something accomplished, that
which is finished; Arbor Day—J. Sterling Morton's birthday—gives promise of
a great good yet to come. From the twig is to come the tree. From the promise
and hope is to come fruition and full performance."</p>

<p>Next in order of the historic events of the Exposition and the first of the
"Special Days" was</p>

<p>OPENING DAY—June 1, 1898</p>

<p>An outline of the exercises and the program of the day has been given an
appropriate place in Chapter III, Part I, of this history.</p>

<p>The invocation of Rev. Samuel J. Niccolls, of St. Louis, Mo., was as
follows:</p>

<p>O God. uncreated and eternal in Thy being, Creator and Lord of all, who dost uphold
and govern all in infinite power, wisdom, righteousness and goodness. we lift up our hearts to Thee in adoration and praise. There is none perfect as Thou art. We rejoice in Thy sovereignty; Thy greatness is unsearchable. The Heavens declare Thy glory, and the
earth is full of the tokens of Thy goodness. Thou art the bounteous giver of all good, the fountain of all wisdom, and spirit of all knowledge, the source of all life and happiness. We are Thy creatures, utterly dependent upon Thee; without Thee we have no wisdom or strength or life of our own.</p>

<p>We are also Thy children, made in Thy image, and capable of sharing Thy life. This
honor Thou hast given us and hast crowned us with sovereignty over the earth. It is our
privilege to call Thee our Father in Heaven; unworthy and sinful as we have made ourselves. Thou hast not forsaken us, but hast, by Thy Holy Spirit, given us wisdom and understanding and power. Thou dost inspire men with high purposes and lead them to execute good and great designs, so, today, in this hour of finished labor, we would not glory in ourselves, or in the work of our hands, but only in Thee, from whom came the wisdom to devise and the power to execute. This glory of human achievement which surrounds us in this place, and which speaks of man's skill and industry, of progress in knowledge and increase in power over the land which Thou hast given us for our inheritance is only a witness and a memorial of Thy great favor towards us. When we remember the way by which Thou hast led us, and from what to what we have come, we are moved to cry in adoring gratitude, "Thou hast not dealt so with any nation." Thou art the God of our fathers, who didst lead them to this western world. Thou didst keep a continent hidden until the fullness of time came, when Thou didst throw open its gates that the people prepared for it, and of Thy own choice, might enter in and possess the land. In it Thou hast lifted up the people and established a nation of freemen. Thine hand hast led us marvelously in the past, and  through Thy favor we are crowned with riches and honor and might. Our eyes have seen the wonders which thou hast wrought in our midst, so that this day the aged among us stand amazed when they recall the past. For all this Exposition represents, for the transfiguration of a wilderness into fruitful fields, and an uninhabited land into populous States, for progress in arts and manufactures, for the fruits of the field, the riches of the mines and the abundance of the forests, for growth in education, refinement, wealth and the comforts of life, for the supremacy of law, the continuance of our free institutions and the bright hopes for the future, we give Thee, O God, our most hearty and grateful thanks.</p>

<p>Oh, Gracious Father, whose bounty is infinite, grant now Thy blessing, we entreat
Thee, upon all who have labored for the establishment and completion of this enterprise.
May what they have done be owned by Thee in advancing and stimulating all the arts
of peace, and in promoting the progress and well-being of society. Bless the city within
whose gates we have come. May peace abide within its walls, and prosperity within its
palaces. Bless the commonwealth of Nebraska, and let Thy favor descend upon its homes,
even as the rain and dews upon its fields. Bless the Governor of this State and all
associated with him in authority and counsel. We pray Thee, also, in behalf of our

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.342.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.342.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.342.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

common country. Remember Thy servant, the President of the United States, his Cabinet,
Thy servants in Congress assembled, and all who bear rule in the several States of this
nation, grant unto them the spirit of wisdom and counsel, strengthen them for any good
work and make them faithful in all things to Thy holy law, so that they may lead the
people in righteousness. While we pray for the land we love, we would remember before
Thee all nations and rulers, especially those who are represented in this Exposition. Grant thy blessing to Queen Victoria and all her subjects, to the President of the Republic of Mexico and all whom he represents. May they be led by Thy good Spirit in all things, and may peace and good-will abide and grow deeper and stronger between them and us.</p>

<p>Oh, God of our fathers, ruler of nations, while we celebrate the triumph of peace,
we remember that the shadow of war is upon our land, and that the sound of conflict smites our ears. We earnestly pray that it may please Thee speedily to restore peace, and to hasten the day when, under the reign of righteousness and love, all wars shall cease. But if, as we believe, Thou hast called us to take the sword to avenge the wrongs of the helpless and oppressed, and to set free our brothers from their bondage, then make us strong to serve Thee and defend us in the day of battle. Bless the army and the navy; shield them from all perils by land or by sea, and grant them victory, which is in Thy hand. Oh, Gracious God, most bountiful benefactor, our hearts are this day lifted up in hope, and Thou dost make us bold to ask the continuance of Thy favors and larger blessings for the future. Thou hast redeemed the region in which we dwell from savage rule, and hast given its abundance into our hands. The wilderness, where once Thy image was defiled by ignorance and superstition, has been filled with happy homes purified by Thy word; Thy temples stand on every side, and Thy people sing Thy praise. But surely Thou hast not brought us so far on our way only to leave us. Abide with us; grant us more of Thy light and truth, and make us faithful in all things to Thy holy law, so that through our obedience to Thee, we may be known as that people where God is the Lord. Multiply peace and prosperity among us. Lift up the poor and cast down the proud. Rebuke vice and oppression, cast down the wicked and defeat their plans. Make righteousness to 
flourish, truth to be established, and brotherly love to prevail in all our burdens. All this we humbly ask in the name of Him, who has taught us to pray, saying "Our Father which art in Heaven; hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth
as it is in Heaven; give us this day our daily bread, and forgive our debts as we forgive if our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT WATTLES</p>

<p>"The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition is a reality today only
by virtue of the pluck and energy and enterprise of the people of the country it
represents. Amid the financial depression of the greatest panic of recent years,
amid the gloom of doubt and distress which followed this panic, the first steps
were taken in this great enterprise.</p>

<p>"Against the advice of many of our most conservative citizens, and the
prophecy of failure by some, the work was begun. During its early stages there
were many discouragements, but when the Congress of the United States recognized the Exposition as worthy of its encouragement and support, all doubts were
dispelled and the people of this community, and of the entire West, rose above
the calamities of the hour and united in the work with an energy which assured success.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.343.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.343.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.343.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"But these beautiful grounds and buildings have not been prepared and filled
with the choicest specimens of the products of the world by chance. This work
represents many weary months of toil, many discouragements and vicissitudes, 
but a final triumph worthy of the men who have given it their best thought and
energy. This, the opening day, crowns their work with an adequate reward.
We see the results of their efforts in this magnificent spectacle of architectural
beauty and grandeur, commanding the admiration and attention of the world.</p>

<p>"This Exposition celebrates no single event in the history of the Trans-
Mississippi country. This history for the period of a single generation past
reveals a succession of achievements, any one of which might properly be the
subject of a great demonstration of this character.</p>

<p>"Fifty years ago the larger part of the country west of the Mississippi River
was unorganized territory, and was indicated on the map as the Great American
Desert. Its arid plains and unexplored mountains were occupied by savage tribes,
and there herds of antelope and buffalo roamed, unmolested by the white man, in
solitude unbroken by the implements of civilization.</p>

<p>"No railroad had been constructed west of the Missouri River. But one city
of more than 50,000 population had been built west of the Mississippi. The total
population of this vast domain, comprising more than two-thirds of the area of
the United States, was less than 2,000,000, and more than three-fourths of this
population was in three States on its southeastern border.</p>

<p>"The city of Omaha had not been founded. The resources on which this
city depends for its great commerce today were undeveloped. Gold had just
been discovered in California, and the march of civilization toward the West had
hardly begun.</p>

<p>"Fifty years is within the memory of many here present, but what a change
has been wrought in this region! Within its borders are now twenty States and
four territories, with a population of more than twenty millions; wealth double
that of Spain and Portugal. combined, and an internal commerce greater than
the foreign commerce of Germany, France and Great Britain.</p>

<p>"The Great American Desert is no more. Its eastern part is covered with
fertile farms, which produced last year more than a thousand million bushels of
corn and five hundred million bushels of wheat which, with the other agricultural
products of this section, were sold for more than eleven hundred million dollars.
The western part of this desert now forms the pasture of the nation. On its
nutritious grasses feed the herds which supply the meat to the markets of the
world.</p>

<p>"In 1850 the buffalo which roamed over this region outnumbered the cattle
in the United States. In 1895 there were thirty million cattle and fifty million
hogs and sheep west of the Mississippi River, and the value of the yearly product
of these herds is four hundred million dollars, or nearly equal in value to the
annual output of the gold and silver mines throughout the world.</p>

<p>"Nor does the grain and stock of this country comprise its only products.
The fruit and wine of California and Oregon, the forests of Washington. Minne-

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.344.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.344.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.344.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

sota
 and Arkansas, the sugar of Louisiana, Utah and Nebraska, and the cotton of
the Southeastern States, furnish no small part of its yearly commerce. But its
mines must not be overlooked. From them has been taken in paying quantities
every known mineral. The copper, iron and coal already discovered would supply
the markets of the world for a century to come. The surface of the mountains
and hills has hardly been prospected, but the richest and most extensive gold and
silver mines in the world have been discovered. From them has been produced
in the past fifty years more than sufficient to pay the Government debt at the close
of the Rebellion, and their annual output now amounts to more than a hundred
million dollars.</p>

<p>"The caravan of prairie schooners, requiring six months of hardship and danger to travel from the Mississippi to the Pacific coast, has been displaced by the
overland express, with palace cars provided with all the conveniences of home,
which travel the distance in thirty-three hours.
No less than 80,000 miles of railroad have been
constructed in the Trans-Mississippi country during the last fifty years, at the fabulous cost of more than two thousand million dollars. Towns
and villages have sprung into existence along 
these roads as by magic. Great cities have been
built, commercial relations established with all
parts of the world, and manufacturing has assumed
enormous proportions.</p>

<p>"Surely, with all these achievements during
the short space of half a century, we might well
celebrate the growth and development unparalleled
in history. But, looking to the future rather than
to the past, the commercial congress which authorized this Exposition wisely conceived its objects to be the advancement of the commercial interests of the West rather than the celebration of any of its past achievements.</p>

<p>"We have gathered here in these beautiful buildings and on these grounds
some of the resources of this vast country, and have invited our Eastern neighbors
and foreign friends to bring their products and come with their citizens to be
our guests and here study with us the lessons of the future which these evidences
of our past of progress teach. If the exhibition here made of the resources of
this new country should demonstrate that greater prosperity and happiness could
be found within its borders for many who now live in less-favored climes, the
purpose of this Exposition would be accomplished.</p>

<p>"With a history that has hardly been written, but which records greater it
growth and more important changes than has been made in any other country
on earth in five hundred years of its life; with natural resources unequaled in
value, variety and extent; with a climate which inspires the greatest mental and
physical activity; with a people composed of the best elements of all nations who

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.345.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.345.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.345.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

have broken the ties which bound them to the homes of their fathers, and have
wrested this country from savage life; with all these advantages and achievements,
a what can we prophesy for the future generation, and who will attempt to limit
the possibilities of a people who have accomplished such wonders in the past?</p>

<p>"This magnificent Exposition, illustrating the products of our soil and mines
and factories, made possible by the inventions of the last century, will pale into
insignificance at the close of the twentieth century. When the agricultural
resources of this rich country are fully developed by the use of its rivers and
streams for irrigation; when the sugar, as well as the bread and meat for the
markets of the world shall be produced here and carried to the markets by the
electric forces of nature; when the minerals, in our mountains and the gold and
silver in our mines shall be extracted and utilized by this same force: when our
natural products shall be manufactured here, then this Trans-Mississippi country
will support a population in peace and plenty greater than the present population
of any other nation in the world.</p>

<p>"When we consider that the British Empire, exclusive of its colonies,
embraces only one hundred and twenty-one thousand square miles, that the
civilization of Egypt was supported on less than ten thousand square miles, and
that with the same density of population as the State of Ohio this country would
provide homes for three hundred million people, we can appreciate the possibilities which the future has in store in this, the richest part of the world's domain.</p>

<p>"Standing at the close of a century teeming with great discoveries and inventions, which have elevated the civilization of the world to a higher plane than
ever before, surrounded with such evidences of the past progress and future
possibilities of this country, who can prophesy its future greatness, and who can
estimate the influence of this Exposition in accelerating its development?</p>

<p>"Like a great beacon light it sends its rays throughout the land and challenges
the attention of the world. To the homeless millions of less-favored lands it is
a messenger of promise. To the weary mariner whose fortunes have been
A wrecked on the seas of adversity it is a harbinger of hope. It opens new fields
to the investor, inspires the ambition of the genius, incites the emulation of States,
and stands the crowning glory in the history of the West."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. JOHN L. WEBSTER</p>

<p>"We meet today amid surroundings that excite the most lively imagination
and rouse the dullest sensibilities. Entrancing and bewitching scenes are all about
us. The best that architecture could plan and that skill could construct and that
art could decorate and adorn, make up the exterior of this, the most unique
Exposition ever witnessed on the American continent.</p>

<p>"These mighty structures stand where fifty years ago were clustered tepees
of the Omaha Indians. Then the silence of this place was disturbed only by the
Indian war-sound, by the revelry of the Indian dance, and the prairies rang with
no sound but the war-whoop of the aborigine. Today it is surrounded by twenty

thousand buildings, the homes of 150,000 people, who are the members of the
rich commercial city of Omaha.</p>

<p>"But this is not an Exposition for our city, or for our State. We are part
and parcel of the great Trans-Mississippi country, a country extending from the
River on the east, which DeSoto discovered, westward to the Pacific ocean, and
from the Mexican republic on the south to the British possessions on the north—
a country with more than fifteen million of the Anglo-Saxon people. It is a
country now divided into States and territories, each large enough for an empire,
with resources unparalleled, with soil unexcelled, and with capabilities immeasurable. It is the granary and market-house of the world. To borrow a thought
from Edmund Burke: 'The scarcity which the empires and kingdoms have many
times felt would have been a desolating famine if this child of their old age, with
a true filial piety, with a Roman charity, had not put the breast of its youthful
exuberance to the mouth of its exhausted parents.'</p>

<p>"On this spot the vast resources and mighty wealth of this extensive Trans-
Mississippi territory are today put on exhibition, not so much for our own
instruction and entertainment as that the rest of
mankind may come and see for themselves, look
on with a startled amazement and depart with
astonishment and wonder.</p>

<p>"But we are not a selfish nor a sectional people. We are a part of a rich, commercial nation. We know but one constitution, but one country,
but one flag. We have opened the doors of the
Exposition to all our fellow-citizens and received
the products and exhibits of all the States, which
gives it a truly national character.
"We are cosmopolitan people and extended
the scope of the enterprise until it becomes international in character. Canada upon the north, and the republics of South America, are here
mingling with us. Exhibitors from various
countries in Europe are here, vying with each other in their efforts to sell. Here
may be seen the Italian, who walks the streets where Czesar's legions once trod;
the Greek from the classic land where Athens was, and where the Spartans won
an unfading historic fame. Here are a dusky people with their camels, from the
deserts of Arabia. Here are Turks from that land whose people bow in prayer.

Here is the Mongolian race from the Chinese Empire, which traces its dynasty
back through the fabulous ages. Here are exhibitors from Japan-that country
which in our day has taken a mighty leap in advance, and is now recognized as
one of the commercial and naval powers of the world. It is this Exposition, so
grand in conception, so broad in purpose and so comprehensive in character, that

is this day thrown open to the throng here present, and which extends a hearty
welcome to the millions who shall visit it.</p>

<p>"To build these immense palaces of beauty we have drawn from the past as
well as the present. We have studied the artistic among all people and in all
countries. In architecture we have drawn from whatever was the most beautiful
in Gothic, whatever was most refined in classic, whatever was most desirable in
Grecian and whatever was most noble in Roman, and supplemented and improved
them with the most artistic conceptions of the present age, and the result we see
before us is a realistic picture of a fairy scene.</p>

<p>"This decorative statuary is not the fruit of a day, the birth of an hour. It
is the present imprint of an art which had its supreme revival in the Moses of
Michael Angelo, and Titian's Tomb by Canova. The figures which these sculptors chiseled from the marble were the letters of the alphabet of art and have left
an impression on the centuries which have come after them. Out of the fulfillment
of that art American skill has dec-orated these buildings with forms of grace and
of beauty, which express the taste and refinement of this age.</p>

<p>"Within the walls of these beautiful buildings, one may wander in a
bewildered maze of exhibits. There will be found the best and richest productions
of American soil—cotton from the vast plantations of Louisiana and Mississippi.
ripened grain from the wheat fields of Minnesota, Washington and Oregon, and
the golden king of corn from Kansas and Nebraska. There may be seen the
woods and finished lumber culled from the pine forests of Michigan, and the high
towering trees of the Columbia River. There may be seen minerals—copper
from the Anaconda, and silver and gold which the energy of our mountain
pioneers have delved from beneath the Rockies and Sierras. There will be seen
the skilled handiwork of the mechanic and artisan, and in Machinery Hall the
perfected result of what was once an inventor's dream. Without this circle is
gathered evidences of the toil, of the prosperity, and of the refinement of seventy
millions of industrial people who have brought America to its present high
standard of national supremacy.</p>

<p>"The Government building at the west end of the lagoon, with its long
colonnades and high shining dome, supporting the Goddess of Liberty, stands as
the emblem of power and strength and majesty of this republic. It speaks for the
greatness of our nation, the realization of what John Bright once said: 'I see
one vast confederation stretching from the frozen north in unbroken line to the
glowing south, and from the wild billows of the Atlantic westward to the calmer
waters of the Pacific main, and I see one people and one law and one language
and one faith, and over all that wide continent the home of freedom, and a refuge
for the oppressed of every race and of every clime.'</p>

<p>"We have reached the condition pictured by John Bright, and we have
passed beyond it. Our commerce envelops the seas, and our navy is in the flush
of victory. Our grasp is on the Sandwich Islands and our gallant Dewey holds
the Philippines.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.348.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.348.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.348.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"The nation's future which John Bright saw falls short of the future we see
today. We are amazed at our own growth since the days of Washington and
Jefferson to our present invincible power. We are now on the high vantage
ground where we can look forward to the fulfillment of American destiny. The
present is already a realized dream and the brightness of the future is stronger
than a vision.</p>

<p>"To know the present let me draw a contrast from the past. Marcus Aurelius
ruled over Rome at the closing of its golden period. His victories in war and
achievements in peace classed him, in the minds of Romans, with Caesar and
Augustus. In a plaza at Rome there was erected a high, towering monument
to his memory. Circling around the column from the base to the capital the
historic scenes and incidents of his career were carved and chiseled in the
solid marble.</p>

<p>"That column still stands, browned by the centuries that have rolled by
since its construction. It stands not alone as a relic of antiquity, but as an historic monument of an age when civilization, linked with all that makes a nation
great and powerful, was in eastern Europe, and when one man ruled the farthest
known portions of the world to the confines of the western sea. At the side of
the square close by is a high and gray colored building, and along in front in
blazoned letters is the name of an American insurance company.</p>

<p>"There is a singular linking together by way of contrast of the changed conditions of seventeen hundred years. If Marcus Aurelius could come forth from
his long slumber his eye would rest on that monument on which is recorded the
deeds of Rome's greatness and grandeur and he would see that Imperial City
mouldy with age and its magnificent structures crumbling into ruins. When he
looked on the assembled multitudes he could not see the legions of old that
marched under his command. He would see a new people and hear a new
language. If he inquired what had wrought this great change, he would find that
civilization, in its onward course and westward march, had discovered a new
continent beyond the sea. That a new race of people with a new language had
built up a mighty republic of seventy millions of people, where industry had
an open field, where science had made new discoveries, where literature and
art and refinement were the common property of all her citizens. That this new
people, with characteristic energy and enterprise, were insuring the lives of the
lazzaroni.</p>

<p>"The scene thus presented to Marcus Aurelius would be more astonishing
to him than were the lines upon the wall which were interpreted to Nebuchadnezzar. Yet this Trans-Mississippi country has developed more and accomplished
more in the last fifty years than was worked out in the seventeen centuries that
marked the space of time between the ages of Marcus Aurelius and the planting
of this western civilization which this Exposition is builded to commemorate.</p>

<p>"To judge of the future, let us draw another lesson from the past: The
earliest civilization had its habitation in western Asia, in Palestine and Assyria.
It joined hands with trade and commerce as time rolled by and left Babylon and

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.349.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.349.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.349.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Nineveh in ruins, and took up its abode in Egypt and northern Africa. Later
on it left the land of the sphynx and pyramids and took up its abode in Greece,
the land that became famous by the sculpture of Praxiteles, by the matchless
oratory of Demosthenes, by the wisdom and philosophy of Socrates and Plato, and
by the statesmanship of Pericles and Phocion; the land whose patriotism made
the names Thermopylae and Marathon synonymous with all that is daring and
brave and glorious in war.</p>

<p>"Time rolled on and civilization, with its companions, trade and commerce,
left this land of charming scenes and bewitching history and passed westward
across the Adriatic to imperial Rome. From the age of Caesar and Augustus
to the time of Constantine, Rome ruled the old world, but civilization traveled
westward until it reached the confines of Europe, where the ocean seemed a
barrier, and stayed its progress for fourteen long centuries. Rome crumbled into
ruins, Brussels and Antwerp and Paris and London became the commercial centers. Italy broke into dukedoms and provinces, and England, France and Germany
became the ruling nations of Europe. Civilization, urged on by its companions,
trade and commerce,'like a man of nervous energy and restless ambition, found
a way to cross the ocean, and the new continent of America was discovered.
They crossed the stormy waters of the sea and made their new home in this
western hemisphere. Here our nation has grown up and the scepter of supremacy
has passed from the old world to the new. In the fulfillment of our destiny, and
to hold trade and commerce within our grasp, we have to work out the problem
of universal civilization. We may have to join hands with the great powers of
Europe to compass the trade of western Asia, and bring it across the Pacific into
the harbor of Puget Sound, and through the Golden Gate.</p>

<p>"We are an international nation; Europe is on the east of us, and Asia is on
the west of us. It is no longer a question of the far East, it is a question of the
West. In the southern waters of the Pacific is Australia, practically a newly
discovered country. The Anglo-Saxon people are already there. It is like a
newly risen sun in the southwestern waters, whose foreign commercial trade of
more than six hundred millions of dollars per year demands our most considerate
attention.</p>

<p>"There, too, at our western door is Japan, already a great commercial nation,
and with a navy that takes first rank with the modern sphynxes of war which
float in Pacific waters. There, too, is China. Russia has crossed that territory
with a line of railroad whose depot stands fronting the surf-line of the western
ocean, and her flag floats over Port Arthur. England, Germany and France
have their navies floating in their waters and their flags flying in her fortified
harbors. China is about to awake from her hibernating sleep of four thousand
years. Her four hundred millions of people are to become the consumers of
American products and the patrons of American commerce. Who can say that
within the next fifty years the commercial trade of the Pacific shall not take
supremacy over the commercial trade of the Atlantic? May not this Exposition
mark the beginning of a new era of prosperity, when the commerce of Europe

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.350.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.350.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.350.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

and of Asia shall find their race course across this mid-continent and pour out
their wealth to overflowing in this Trans-Mississippi country.</p>

<p>"A month ago it was a serious question whether the war with Spain would
not injure this Exposition, but within a month it has become an accentuation of
the expansive power of the American nation. A month ago the American people
were disposed to cling to the traditional policy of isolation; today they receive
with patriotic enthusiasm the doctrine of annexation and of conquest. A month
ago the Philippines were in the far East; today they are in the nearer West.</p>

<p>"Emilio Castelar said to the Spanish Cortez, twenty-seven years ago, words
which in these days of rapid change breathe the spirit of prophecy: 'America, and
especially Saxon America, with its immense virgin territories, with its republic,
with its equilibrium between stability and progress, with its harmonies between
liberty and democracy, is the continent of the future, the immense continent
stretched by God between the Atlantic and the Pacific, where mankind may essay
and resolve all social problems. Europe is to decide whether she will confound
herself with Asia, placing upon her lands old altars and upon the altars old idols,
and upon the idols plutocracies and upon the plutocracies empires, or whether
she will collaborate with America in the grand work of human civilization.'</p>

<p>"Spain heeded not his voice. She has not taken part with America in the
grand work of civilization. She has clung to her old idols and her despotic
i empire. In this, the close of the nineteenth century, she carried to the beautiful
Island of Cuba the cruel and relentless warfare of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>"Our Saxon civilization, of which Castelar spoke, entered its protest against
the barbarism of the Middle Ages being transplanted to this island of the western
hemisphere, and determined to eradicate it by the severe arbitrament of war. It
is our high standard of civilization, our love of liberty, our sympathy with suffering humanity, our regard for national honor, that has brought us to the initial
point where we must solve questions of national policy and ·which we are to settle
for future ages before the present century shall close.</p>

<p>"A month ago the Sandwich Islands seemed too remote an object for the
grasp of national ambition. They have now become a resting place for the
American army in its race across the Pacific to give aid and assistance to our
navy in the Philippines and to make complete the conquest of Admiral Dewey,
whose victory at Manila is the wonder of the age and the marvel of the seas.</p>

<p>"Yonder Administration building is supported by four open arches, looking
toward the four points of the compass. They are emblematic of the thought that
this Exposition stands in the center of the American republic, and that the people
of the Trans-Mississippi country, through those gateways, are ready to welcome
the commerce and trade from the four corners of the earth, which shall make
us the greatest, the happiest and the most prosperous people in the world."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. JOHN N. BALDWIN</p>

<p>"Man delights in retrospection and indulges in anticipation. The faithful
historian never lacks appreciative audiences, for the dullest eye must lighten
and the most sluggish pulse quicken at the recital of the trials and triumphs of
the past. Neither is a prophet without honor, even in his own country, when to
listeners, whose hopes and aims are one with his, he predicts a glorious future.</p>

<p>"But the critic of existing institutions treads no primrose path. Unless carefully guarded in expression he will damn with faint praise, disgust with fulsome
flattery, or awaken jealousy by unfavorable comparison. In all ages there are
those who insist that the present time is sick and out of joint; that there is nothing
in the present like unto the past; and that whatever is, is not comparable with
what is to be.</p>

<p>"Fortunately for the progress of the world, those who revel in rehearsals
and venture so much in prophecy have not been in the majority; only sufficient

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>John N. Baldwin</p>
 
</div>

in number to disturb and impede. It is sad to say,
but it must be said, that, in our own time, there
are so many individuals who insist that there is
no progress today except in mechanics.</p>

<p>"They croak and cry, 'It is simply the time of
steam, steel and starvation. Like puny whispers
they pull their pencils to write, 'The State in danger.' They declare and resolve that governments are so drawn and trussed that for the few there is
plethoric plenty while the many starve. They
philosophize that this is an age of machinery, not
an heroical, devotional, philosophical or moral age.</p>

<p>"These contentions and opinions impose upon
the thoughtful, intelligent and progressive men of
the time, who believe that the present is better than
the past and promises more for the future, the
task of denial of assertion and of proof, to deny and assert is easy. To prove
requires organization and labor. In their efforts to arouse men to more glorious
triumphs, they met with many difficulties. "Happy men are full of the present,
for its bounty suffices them; and wise men also, for its duties engage them.' The
busy man would say, 'With me it is what I eat, where shall I drink, my body, and
what shall it put on?' The iconoclastic man, 'Do not talk about our achievements.
It is better to listen forever than to brag.' Among these and many others the
opinion prevails that there are two classes of lies—common lies and statistics.
'Give us proofs,' they say, 'outward signs and tokens.'</p>

<p>"In vain did they plead, as did the wise men of old, 'Say not thou, what is the
cause that the former days were better than these? For thou dost not inquire
wisely concerning this.'</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.352.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.352.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.352.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"From out these discussions, controversies and opinions evolved the idea of
an Exposition. Tested, it has been found to be practical and promotive. The
Exposition is an item of evidence. It goes to prove not only what has been done,
but what may be accomplished. It is an eye-witness and an expert. It lays in
your hand the record of the past. It makes, while you look, the exhibits of the
present. It paints before your eyes the splendor of still greater achievements on
the cloud curtain of the future. It shows itself wherever there is a spirit of a
commercialism, a sense of pride, and an impulse for improvement.</p>

<p>"The Exposition has become the instrument of civilization. Being a concomitant to empire, westward it takes its way—The Crystal Palace, the Centennial,
the World's Fair, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.</p>

<p>"We celebrate at this hour the opening of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, and this day marks an important era in our development.</p>

<p>"The purpose of this Exposition is to display the products, manufactures
and industries of the States and territories west of the Mississippi River. The
territory embraced is two-thirds of the area of the Union and contains nineteen
States and five territories. Part of this territory was acquired by purchase from
France in 1803. and part by treaties, negotiations and cessions.</p>

<p>"I refer to these facts because from 1802 to 1850 this purchase, these treaties
and these cessions were the subject of public discussions and much that was said
and written fittingly illustrates the thought I have heretofore endeavored to
express.</p>

<p>"During these times some there were who dealt much in prophecy, and
what they then foretold is of surpassing interest in view of what has since
happened.</p>

<p>"Referring to the standard histories and the leading reviews of this period, I
find that the opponents of the acquisition of this territory said that the east would
be depopulated. The mere extent of territory would rend the public apart.
No common ties of interest would ever bind together under one government men
who fought Indians, trapped bears and hunted buffaloes, and men who built ships
and caught fish in the harbors of the Atlantic ocean. It would enormously
increase the public debt. Two millions for an island and possibly as much ground
on the main land as is now covered by the State of New York was enough in
all conscience, but to pay fifteen million dollars for lands containing over one
million square miles was revolutionary and unconstitutional. The limits of the
federation could not be safely extended beyond the stony (Rocky) mountains.
As late as 1825 one United States Senator boldly proclaimed in the Senate:
member of Congress traveling from his home to Washington and return would
cover a distance of 9,200 miles. At the rate of thirty miles per day, and allowing
him forty-four clays for Sundays, three hundred and fifty days would be consumed,
and the member would have fourteen days in Washington before he started home.
It would be quicker to go around Cape Horn or by Behring's Strait, Baffin Bay
and Davis Strait to the Atlantic, and so to Washington.'</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.353.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.353.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.353.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"They also said, ‘All settlers who go beyond the Mississippi River will be forever lost to the United States} Pike, whose name is attached to the giant peak
of the Rockies, condemned these plains to everlasting sterility. He officially
reported to the War Department as follows: ‘F rom these immense prairies will be
derived one great advantage to the United States, namely, the restriction of our
population to some certain limits, and thereby a continuation of the Union. They
will be constrained to limit themselves to the borders of the Missouri and the
Mississippi, while they leave the prairies, incapable of cultivation, to the wandering
and uncivilized aborigines of the country.'</p>

<p>"In 1858 the <em class="hi">North American Review</em> declared: 'The people of the United States have reached their inland western frontier and the banks of the Missouri
are the shores at the termination of a vast ocean desert of one thousand miles in
breadth which it is proposed to travel, if at all, with caravans of camels and
which interpose a final barrier to the establishment of large communities, agricultural, commercial or even pastoral.'</p>

<p>"In all authorized publications, and on all school maps, the strip of land lying
west of the Missouri River and east of the Rocky mountains, south to the Mexican
frontier and north to British America, was called 'an unknown land' and
designated as 'the Great American Desert.'</p>

<p>"I have the honor today of being the official spokesman of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. In the discharge of the duty imposed upon
me I now and here assert, realizing full well the breadth and depth and meaning
of every word I utter, that in fertility and productiveness of soil, in mountains
and meadows, rivers and lakes, metals and minerals, forests and farms, sea-coast
and harbors, cereals, fruits and flowers, cattle, horses and hogs, healthful climate,
grandeur of scenery and intelligence and industry of inhabitants, there is not on
this globe a body or tract of land of the same area equal to that region of country
covered by the States and territories of the Union west of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>"In proof whereof we welcome you to these grounds. Come through these
gates and enter these buildings, and we will give you ocular proof, or</p>

<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">'At the least shall so prove it,</span>
<span class="l">That the probation bears no hinge nor loop</span>
<span class="l">To hang a doubt on.'</span></span>

<p>"With samples and exhibits, records and reports, with representatives credentialed and accredited, we will prove to the thoughtful, intelligent and unprejudiced people of the world, that 'the Great American Desert' must have deserted,
for it can not be found. Where fifty years ago they said it was, we will show a
farm of 67,000,000 acres under cultivation, producing annually products of the
value of $1,000,000,000.</p>

<p>"The prairies which were considered 'incapable of cultivation,' produce
annually 1,200,000,000 bushels of corn, 350,000,000 bushels of wheat and 30,000,000 tons of hay, of the aggregate value of $600,000,000, making no accounting
of the other cereals, the fruits and the vegetables.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.354.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.354.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.354.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"Instead of 'trapping bear and hunting buffaloes,' 9,000,000 horses and mules
work in the valleys; 32,000,000 cattle feed on the hills; 51,000,000 of sheep and
hogs, fleece and fatten, and this livestock alone is of the aggregate value of
$1,200,000,000.</p>

<p>"They thought $15,000,000 was an extortionate price to pay for this wilderness. Today the annual output of gold and silver is $100,000,000; of copper and
other minerals, $100,000,000, and of coal, $30,000,000. With the precious metals
alone from our mines we could pay the purchase price in sixty days.</p>

<p>"The 'barrier to the establishment of commercial enterprise,' stormed by the
sturdy frontiersmen, gave way and on the other side hum and whirl the wheels of
factories, turning out annually $1,400,000,000 worth of the best and cheapest
manufactured goods in the world.</p>

<p>"The 'caravans of camels' not coming from their Egyptian midnight, the
people of this country constructed 80,000 miles of railway as a means of travel
and transportation.</p>

<p>"In the land where only fifty years ago 'wandering and uncivilized aborigines'
sought shelter in wigwams and leaf tents, now live 22,000,000 of intelligent people,
with 121 universities and colleges, 62,000 schoolhouses, 5,700,000 children, 6,000
newspapers and 45,000 religious organizations, having a membership of 3,500,000
and worshiping in 44,000 church edifices.</p>

<p>"The aggregate wealth of this region of country is $22,000,000,000, or more
than one-half the entire capital of Great Britain.</p>

<p>"These are not figures of speech, but the arithmetic of facts. I have given the
numbers round but always under.</p>

<p>"For one of these territories the Government paid $7,000,000, yet in a few
years it received from the seal islands embraced therein, alone, the purchase price,
and there is now in sight in its gold mines enough to pay the national debt.</p>

<p>"Another has the greatest onyx mines in the world, yet its shipments of fruit
amount to 10,000,000 pounds a year.</p>

<p>"One of these Trans-Mississippi States has the greatest deposits of marble
of any State in the Union, and yet this same State took the prize at the Columbian
Exposition for the best apples in the world.</p>

<p>"Another leads the Union not only in gold or silver production, but in the
production of wool as well, and it has more sea-coast than the States of Maine,
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New
Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina combined.</p>

<p>"Still another produces annually an amount equal to four hundred dollars
for each of its inhabitants, man, woman or child, and no other country in the
world can show an equal product per capita.</p>

<p>"Another State has already taken from its mines silver to an amount equal
to the present circulation of silver coin in the United States. One thousand miles
from the place where stand the greatest flour mills in the world, and all in this
same territory, is a land where cotton, corn and olives grow in adjoining fields.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.355.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.355.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.355.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"In one State there is a greater variety of minerals than in any other section
of country of like size in the world. Another has a region of country in the hills
a hundred miles square, which is the richest in the world, containing the largest
and most easily worked mass of low grade ore yet discovered. Another has an
area equal to the German Empire, with 62,000 miles to spare, and could sustain
upon its surface with ease and prosperity the entire population of the United
States.</p>

<p>"Here we find 'literature and the elegant arts growing up side by side with I
the grosser plants of daily interest} In almost every city are academies of painting, sculpture, music and literature. The development in the fine arts has not
been as conspicuous as in the industrial pursuits. I do not think that I would be
superfluously explanatory if I assigned the reason.</p>

<p>"These people have imagination and taste, and long hold communion with
the visible forms of all that is beautiful and refined, but for the last fifty years
they have been using their brain and brawn in a war with rude nature. They have
been employing their genius to find reason and glory in matter. With them it
has been an age of utility and utensil. Egyptian and Indian architecture, Phidian
sculpture, Gothic ministers, Italian paintings, Grecian epics and Scottish ballads
are not produced by a people whose time is consumed in constructing railways,
building cities, disemboweling mountains, draining lakes into irrigating canals,
'bottling up the forces of gravity and selling it by retail,' yoking electricity and
steam, and directing them both as unwearied and obedient servants.</p>

<p>"The results which this Exposition will show to have been attained are
largely due to the character of the people who took possession of this land. They were of the best blood of the Union; men of depth and range; of aplomb and
reserve; of judgment and common sense. Men who would spare nothing and
wanted everything. Men who believed in action and knew the value of every
moment of time. Men who realized 'that the poorest day that passes over us is
the conflux of two eternities. It is made up of currents that issue from the
remotest past and flow onward into the remotest future} Men who soon found
that agriculture was just beginning when they felled the forest, and that driving from the streams the Indian and his canoe was not the end of commerce. Men who were willing to give their lifework to the making of the alphabet of the language of development, leaving the word-forming and phrase-making to those who would succeed them. Men who, actuated by the impulse to better themselves and also their descendants, co-operating with the organic effort of nature 'to mount and ameliorate,' overcame the 'wilderness' and converted the 'desert' into a garden of benefits.</p>

<p>"I do not believe I shall have adequately discharged the duty of this office
unless I speak of one other factor in the glorious development of this great
country. We today should bow our heads in reverence and speak the name of
Abraham Lincoln. The greatest single factor or agency in the development of this country and in the bringing of this people together in a spirit of union and brotherhood was the construction of the Pacific railways, and Abraham Lincoln was the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.356.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.356.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.356.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

leading public man who had sufficient prescience of the necessity of the construction of these railways.</p>

<p>"And Abraham Lincoln was of this people. He was born about 100 miles
from the east line of the Louisiana purchase. For fifty-two of the fifty-six years of his life on earth he labored in this territory with the pioneers for the development of this country, the organization of its society and the establishment and
preservation of this government. He was a frontiersman, and yet of all the
greatest, the best and the mightiest men of the past nineteen centuries, he was the
only man of whom we can say, 'Some there are who doubt the divinity of Christ,
but no one the godliness of Lincoln.'</p>

<p>"When the cornerstone of this great enterprise was laid, many were the
things which we promised you would see and hear on Opening Day. And now
into these magnificent buildings and on these beautiful grounds we ask the people
of the earth to come and judge of their fulfillment.</p>

<p>"While our eyes are enrapt urd with the glories of these scenes, our ears will
be enchanted with the promised song.</p>

<span class="lg song">
<span class="l">"Uplift a thousand voices full and sweet</span>
<span class="l">In this wide hall, with earth's inventions stored,</span>
<span class="l">And praise the invisible, universal Lord,</span>
<span class="l">Who lets once more in peace the nations meet</span>
<span class="l">Where science, art and labor have outpoured,</span>
<span class="l">Their myriad horns of plenty at our feet."</span></span>

<p>ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR SILAS A. HOLCOMB, NEBRASKA</p>

<p>"This occasion, the day and the hour, will ever remain memorable in the
A history of the Trans-Mississippi country. It marks a most interesting event in the
history of this commonwealth and measures a step forward in the progress of
our great republic. To the people of Nebraska, the ceremonies attending the
opening of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition are freighted
with special and personal interests of the most impressive character.</p>

<p>"This day has been anxiously awaited by every patriotic citizen of the State.
The inception and successful inauguration of an enterprise, so grand in its scope,
and fraught, as we believe it is, with so much good to the present and future
generations, is gratifying alike to all. An Exposition denoting the ever-advancing
civilization of the present age, and by a people inhabiting over one-half of the
area of the United States and comprising over one-third of its population, held A
within the boundaries of our great commonwealth, is an honor and a distinction
gratifying to our State pride, and for which all Nebraskans are duly appreciative.
For five months it will be the great pleasure, as well as a high privilege, for our
people to extend, with welcome hands and warm hearts, a hospitable greeting
to the people of all portions of our common country, and to those from other
lands who may participate in or visit this magnificent display. We cordially
invite all to visit us and view the evidence of the marvelous progress made by

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.357.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.357.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.357.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the people of the great West in the material advancement in the industries, arts
and sciences; to learn of the wonderful and inexhaustible resources of a country g
which in extent forms an empire and whose unparalleled resources, when utilized,
can be made to bless and make happy millions of mankind who may in this vast
domain find innumerable opportunities for the establishment of prosperous homes.</p>

<p>"Here, gathered by the energy, industry and ingenuity of man, will be found g
the products of land and sea, of farm and field, of factory and mine, all giving
evidence of the wonderful richness of a country yet only partially developed, and
displaying the marvelous progress made its citizens in keeping step with the
grand march of civilization throughout the world. The spirit of progress and
philanthropy in the upbuilding of an industrial empire in our midst, displayed
upon every hand, must challenge the admiration and solicit unstinted praise from
all who shall visit us and behold what has been accomplished by these people in
scarce one-half century of labor. These are the evidences of the intelligent and

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Silas A. Holcomb, Governor of Nebraska</p>
 
</div>

well-directed efforts of a people who, with a
courage that is undaunted and a faith that is
undismayed,  have wrested from nature's primeval
conditions this beautiful land, and established a
civilization that will forever bless mankind.</p>

<p>"This great Exposition celebrates and Commemorates no important epoch a the history of the country. It is an epoch in itself. It has grown and assumed shape and form as an expression of the desires of a people to celebrate the development of the resources of a country, the result of their own struggles, labors and final triumphs. It is grander and more far-reaching in its scope than the celebration of some anniversary in our country's history. It emphasizes and makes comprehensive the accomplishments of an intelligent, progressive people toward a higher civilization. It is a composite picture of the growth of a people made during the early years of settlement in a new and untried country. It is befitting, as the nineteenth century is drawing to a close, with its fruitage of the manifold blessings which have been showered upon the people of the earth during its reign, that we of the western and newer half of the American republic should take an inventory of the stock of great riches of which we are possessed, in order that we may thereby be the better enabled to assume the duties and responsibilities and to solve the problems of the advancement of the human race that come crowding upon us with the dawning of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>"With the force of a proverb it has been said of man 'Know thyself;' and
with greater emphasis may it be declared, 'Know thy country.' Study its structure as formed by divine hands. Know its rivers and mountains, its forests and
prairies, its valleys and plains, its climate and soil. Learn of its hidden treasures

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.358.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.358.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.358.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of gold and silver, of coal and iron; its productive fields of grain and grasses, of
vegetables and fruits, its plains of rich grazing for horses, cattle and sheep.
Inform yourself of the cities and towns, of telegraphs and telephones, of railroads
and steamboats, of the ever-pulsing arteries of commerce, the facilities for
exchange of the products of man's ingenuity and industry, and a faint conception will be gained of the present greatness and future possibilities of this magnificent Trans-Mississippi country.</p>

<p>"As this beautiful Exposition city, with its thousands of exhibits representing
every branch of industry, pleasing to the eye and inspiring to the mind, has
sprung into existence in so short a period as if by magic, so has the Trans-
Mississippi country developed during the last half century with marvelous
rapidity. This has been accomplished by the courage and untiring energy of those
who have peopled its broad domains. The evidences here witnessed of the
advancement of the people and the development of the country's resources inspire
within us a spirit of thankfulness that God has given us so goodly a land, to be
made beautiful and to fructify for the enjoyment and benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>"Though young in years, we of the West ask no allowance on the score of
age, but challenge investigation and comparison with improvements made by
countries of maturer years, confident that no unfavorable impression of us will
result therefrom. In this hour of festivity and rejoicing we are not unmindful
that it is also a time of trial for the nation. Loyal citizens from every section of
the country have sprung to arms in defense of national honor, in the cause of
humanity. Sectional lines have been obliterated in the face of threatened danger
from foreign foes. A reunited people are fighting side by side under the stars
and stripes, the banner of liberty and progress.</p>

<p>"Amidst these marvelous collections of our triumphs in the peaceful pursuits of life we hope it may again be demonstrated that 'peace hath her victories 
no less renowned than war,' and that our countrymen of the East may meet us
here in this midway city of the continent, learn of our progress in the past, our
aspirations and high aims, our hopes for the future, and the integrity of our purpose and determination to contribute to a better civilization in developing this
great country and to attain the high destiny designed for us by the Maker of the
Universe."</p>

<p>NEBRASKA DAY—June 14, 1898</p>

<p>An outline of the exercises and the program which was carried out on
Nebraska Day has been given in an appropriate place in Chapter III, Part I, of
this History. The original poem and addresses on that occasion were as follows:</p>

<p>"NEBRASKA," BY MRS. IDAEL MacKEEVER, OF STROMSBURG</p>


<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">You may talk of Eastern cities, of their populace and size,</span>
<span class="l">Of their buildings reaching upward to the blue dome of the skies,</span>

<p>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT GURDON W. WATTLES</p>

<p>"In behalf of the management of the Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition, I accept this beautiful building dedicated here today for the comfort and convenience of the citizens of Nebraska. I commend the wisdom of its conception, the care and economy in its erection and the beauty and convenience of its design. The management of the Exposition appreciates the broad and liberal hospitality of the State Board of Directors in providing a home on these grounds, not only for our own citizens, societies and institutions, but for the representatives

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Nebraska Building</p>
 
</div>

of other States and territories. The comforts of this building will accept its hospitality. It will do much to accomplish one of the great objects of this Exposition, which is to cement the ties of friendship and good feeling, and bind together with pleasant memories and common interests the  citizens from all parts of this great country. The East has misunderstood the West and has not appreciated its resources, its citizens and its magnificent opportunities. To the State of Nebraska, the future historian will give the credit of
erecting, in times of adversity, a great Exposition, destined to break down prejudices, build up commerce and promote peace and good-ill throughout the land.</p>

<p>"When our excellent Governor recommended, in his last biennial message
to the legislature of this State, a liberal appropriation in aid of this Exposition, a discussion of the merits of this enterprise as precipitated throughout the State, which for several months grew in intensity until a bill as finally passed and became a law providing for a State building and a State exhibit. Many of the speeches in opposition to this measure would be amusing if reproduced here today. But when we consider the conditions which prevailed three years ago in this State, can not wonder that many questioned the advisability of the enterprise. A great

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.361.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.361.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.361.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

panic had paralyzed our business interests; to crop failures had discouraged
our farming communities; many of our citizens in the western parts of the State
had but recently received public charity, and many had abandoned their lands
to seek homes in Southernclimes or to go back to Eastern friends and relatives.
Conditions never had seemed more discouraging, and to many who live only in
the present, an Exposition of our resources in 1898 meant failure and disgrace.</p>

<p>"But adverse conditions make heroes. The richest inheritance of this generation is the courage and energy of the pioneers of the West. These pioneers subdued the savage tribes which occupied this territory, drove back the buffalo and antelope and made productive farms of the desert they occupied. They built railroads, schoolhouses, churches and colleges; they bravely met and surmounted every emergency; they ere the best blood and brain of the East and of all parts of the world. From them and their descendants came words of encouragement and support to the managers of this enterprise. These men, who had seen the State of Nebraska in times of temporary adversity before, knew that the natural conditions of this State justified the expectation of a speedy return of good crops and prosperity in business, and so from all parts of the State, by petition and through the press, came a demand in favor of the Exposition which our legislators could not resist.</p>

<p>"That the appropriation of State and national funds for this Exposition as
wise can not be doubted by any who believe in public schools and other public
institutions of learning. From an educational standpoint, what could impart more
information and better education than an Exposition of this character? Who
can stand at either end of the Grand Court and look at the magnificent spectacle
of architectural grandeur there displayed without receiving impressions and
inspirations which will last through life? To the farmer hose days are spent
in honest toil in the quiet and peaceful pursuits of country life, what must be
the sensations of wonder and delight in seeing for the first time the electrical
effects of these grounds and buildings at night? To the great majority of our
citizens who have never seen the capital of the nation and the departments of our
Government, what could be more interesting and educating than the illustration
of the workings of these departments made in the beautiful Government building
here? To one and all the display of art from the masters of the Old World and
the best painters of modern times, the statuary, the machinery, the products of
farm and factory, and the highest and best results of genius and invention can
not fail to be a school of learning that could not be equaled in any other way.</p>

<p>"But the financial benefits of this Exposition to the State of Nebraska and
to the entire agricultural ill amply repay the expense and effort in its promotion.
Already has the attention of the world been attracted by the magnificent display
of our resources here made, and during the next four months thousands of
homeseekers and investors will visit the Exposition and investigate the opportunities of the West. That this State ill secure its full share of this tide of
immigration we can not doubt when we consider that the growing crops this
year in many counties promise to exceed the value of the farms on which they

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.362.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.362.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.362.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

are produced, that the livestock interests of the State have doubled in the last
four years, and that thousands of acres of the richest and best lands in the world
for the production of corn and sugar beets are today unoccupied. New life and
energy will be infused in all branches of industry throughout the State by the
men and money that will be attracted here by the Exposition and the improved
conditions which no prevail. The investment of this State will be returned
many fold by the increase in value of its taxable property and by the higher and
better civilization of its citizens.</p>

<p>"In view of the many benefits of this Exposition to the State of Nebraska,
I most heartily congratulate His Excellency, the Governor, the lawmakers of
this State and the State Board of Directors of the Exposition on the wisdom and
statesmanship displayed in making an appropriation for a State building and an
exhibit here. I congratulate them on this magnificent building, which does honor
to the State it represents and credit to the Exposition of which it forms a part.
In the name of the Exposition, I accept this building for the purposes for which
it is this day dedicated."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. WILLIAM J. BRYAN</p>

<p>"Nebraska is ready to do her part in time of war as well as in time of peace. Her citizens ere among the first to give expression to their sympathy with the Cuban patriots, and her representatives in the Senate and House took a prominent part in the advocacy of armed intervention by the United States.</p>

<p>"When the President issued a call for volunteers, Nebraska's quota was promptly furnished, and she is prepared to respond to the second and
subsequent calls.</p>

<p>"Nebraska's attitude upon this subject does not, whoever, indicate that the State is inhabited by a contentious or warlike people; it simply proves that our people understand both the rights conferred and the obligations imposed by a proximity to Cuba. Understanding these rights and obligations, they do not shrink from any consequences which may follow the performance of a national duty. </p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Hon. William J. Bryan</p>
 
</div>

<p>"War is harsh; it is attended by hardship and suffering; it means a vast
expenditure of men and money. We may well pray for the coming of the time,
promised in Holy Writ, when the spears shall be beaten into pruning-hooks and
the swords into ploughshares; but the universal peace can not come until justice is enthroned throughout the world. Jehovah deals with nations as He deals with men, and for both decrees that 'the ages of sin is death.' Until the right has triumphed in every land and love reigns in every heart, governments must, as a

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.363.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.363.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.363.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

last resource, appeal to force. As long as the oppressor is deaf to the advice of reason, so long must the citizen accustom his shoulder to the musket and his
hand to the saber.</p>

<p>"Our nation exhausted diplomacy in its efforts to secure a peaceable solution of the Cuban question, and only took up arms when it as compelled to choose between agricultural and servile acquiescence in cruelties which would have been a disgrace to barbarism.</p>

<p>"History will vindicate the position taken by the United States in the war
with Spain. In saying this, I assume that the principles which ere invoked in
the inauguration of the agricultural will be observed in its prosecution and conclusion. If a contest undertaken for the sake of humanity degenerates into a agricultural of conquest, we shall find it difficult to meet the charge of having added hypocrisy to greed.</p>

<p>"Is our national character so weak that e can not withstand the temptation
to appropriate the first piece of land that comes within our reach? To inflict upon the enemy all possible harm is legitimate warfare, but shall e contemplate a scheme for the colonization of the Orient merely because our fleet on a remarkable victory in the harbor of Manila?</p>

<p>"Our guns destroyed a Spanish fleet, but can they destroy the self-evident
truth that governments derive their just powers, not from superior force, but
from the consent of the governed?</p>

<p>"Shall we abandon a just resistance to European encroachment upon the
western hemisphere in order to mingle in the controversies of Europe and Asia?</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. WILLIAM E. GURLEY</p>

<p>"Fellow-citizens: The dedication of the Nebraska building is in reality the
inauguration of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. The orators of this occasion,
speaking with authority, voice the welcomes of a most gracious host, the commonwealth of Nebraska. The ceremonials of this hour convey formal notice to the civilized world that the hospitality of our State is boundless, and that every guest within our gates shall find a royal welcome.</p>

<p>"The American exposition of the broadest scope has heretofore been not
only commemorative, but has been the chronicle of some great national anniversary, or the celebration of an epoch in history. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition has no place in this majestic series of formal festivals. No memory which duty enjoins to embalm in marble sits enthroned among the palaces of this
triumphal city. It rears today its domes of gold and minarets of alabaster as an inspiration born of the passionate impulse of a proud people; not a memory, but a radiant dream—a dream which is also a prophecy!</p>

<p>"For more than a hundred years the traditions of the Republic have found
lodgement among the granite hills of New England and in the pine groves and
cotton fields of the balmy South. To New England and the South we turn with
pride to read the annals of American ancestry; but in the magnificent prairie and mountain States, those colossal principalities which comprise the 'seat of empire'

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.364.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.364.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.364.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of the new West, enthroned between the mountains and the Mississippi, we behold
the fulfillment of the hope of American posterity.</p>

<p>"The Centennial and the World's Fair were superb monuments to the glittering pageantry of completed history. The Exposition to which we bid you
welcome is unique in character, and in its promise of future grandeur more
wonderful than the crystallization of centuries of matured development which
characterized the national pageants at Philadelphia and Chicago. The perfected
products of a matured civilization may ell incite the admiration of observant
men. But it has remained for the progressive population of this royal region,
rich in resources beyond the flight of the most exuberant fancy, to present for
the delectation of mankind the inexhaustible treasures of an incomparable territory, comprising the most princely provinces of our national domain.</p>

<p>"This Exposition is representative, not of what we have been, but rather of
what we may be, and, under the providence of God, what we are to be. Nebraska
rejoices that the time has come when, as the official
representative of the great agricultural, she may extend
a welcome to the denizens of the East; hopeful and
confident that by contact and association those
errors and misconceptions which have arisen as to
the character and purpose of her citizenship may
be forever sept away.</p>

<p>"Conservative and radical are much-abused
terms. In recent years they have been employed
to emphasize a demarkation line between the
so-called eastern and western halves of the Republic. The accumulated wealth of the East, by virtue
of the logic of human nature, has impressed its
timidity and conservative quality upon the citizenship of that portion of the Republic. In the East

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>William F. Gurley</p>
 
</div>

dwell the sentinels of wealth; in the West, pioneers
of fortune. He who has is ever conservative, while he who hopes is ever radical.
I do not hesitate to affirm that the radicalism of the West, born of honest tumult
and patriotic commotion, is the sure sign of that superb progression which blazes
the pathway of civilization, and builds the roadways for the onward march of
humanity toward the final and triumphal destiny of the race.</p>

<p>"To be radical is to agitate, and in agitation lies the safety of the Republic.
Some one had defined agitation to be 'marshaling the conscience of a nation to
mould its laws,' and since John Brown trod the soil of Kansas we of the West have
been agitators. Popular government can only exist through a continual process
of fermentation. Free speech is at the basis of free institutions, and out of the
clamor and heat of partisan discussion arises the best thought, the highest purpose of a patriotic people.</p>

<p>"Fellow-citizens, I can conceive of no more appropriate occasion than the
present, on this day, and at this hour, to protest against the misconception of our

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.365.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.365.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.365.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

status as a commonwealth or our purposes as a people. with seventeen years of 
personal knowledge and an intimate acquaintance with the history of Nebraska
since its admission to the sisterhood of States, as a loyal son of this glorious
commonwealth, I challenge the assertion, whenever and wherever made, that any
branch of our State government, in any period of its history, has ever made an
assault upon the rights of citizenship, real or personal, or endeavored to wield an
arbitrary authority in defiance of law or constitution.</p>

<p>"Agitation is one thing—lawlessness another. The West is turbulent, but
not lawless; and out of that turbulency and commotion, there arises the spirit of
the genius of liberty.</p>

<p>"Today, Nebraska throws open wide her golden gates and summons to her
portals the myriads of mankind. To this enchanted city of the plains she lures
with wizard wand the unnumbered host of other lands and climes. Superb
sponsor of a regal hospitality, broad as the prairies, rich and varied as the mountain ranges which rear their snow-crowned crests in salutation to the sky; robed
in the glittering garments which nature weaves alone in token of man's toil;
imperial in her pride, her sovereign brow tinged with the glow of the approaching dawn, she bids the nations hail."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. CONSTANTINE J. SMYTH</p>

<p>"Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: This is Nebraska's day; It is on this
day that we may sound the praises of our great commonwealth. She bids her
sons do this, not in the spirit of vanity, but that she·may be known as she is. Not
one jot or tittle would she take from the glory of her sister States who have
come here to display in these buildings and on these grounds the evidences of
their growth, their wealth and their enterprise, with delight will she listen
when they tell of their resources and their triumphs. To them she extends that
welcome which becomes a generous, broad-minded and truly American commonwealth; and to none will she yield in admiration of their greatness.</p>

<p>"If we would understand Nebraska as she is, the work of her sons in bringing her to her present condition and the probabilities of her future, we must
look back and contemplate, if only for a moment, the 'small beginnings' from
which she sprang.</p>

<p>"In 1834, the Congress of the United States denominated the territory of
which she as then a part as 'The Indian Country.' It was, in fact, at that time
the country of the savage. The white man had no dominion therein, and the sweet
word 'home' was without a meaning on all its broad prairies. Less than fifty
years ago the Omaha Indians held title to the land on which we stand, and the
entire white population at that time in this vast territory did not exceed five
thousand souls.</p>

<p>"Not many years after the Omahas ceded their title to this territory to the
United States, Nebraska's pioneers came and commenced the work of home building and State building. The days of the freighters followed; the Union Pacific

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.366.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.366.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.366.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

was projected and finished; the ox-team gave way to the freight train; the
prairie schooner to the upholstered car, and thus the evolution went on until within
the short span of forty-five years it has culminated in the palaces of art that lift
their classic outlines within the walls of this Exposition. Marvelous has been
the progress.</p>

<p>"The surplus products of her farms last year-that is, the products she was
able to send to market—were worth over fifty-five million dollars. She has over
three thousand factories, with a capital invested of forty million dollars. These we
factories pay yearly more than thirteen million dollars in ages, and the value of
their output is ninety-five million dollars annually. Here on the border of her chief
city are located packing houses which bring Nebraska near to the second packing
center of the world. Fourteen lines of railway
have a mileage of four thousand seven hundred
and thirty miles carrying Nebraska's commerce.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Constantine J. Smyth</p>
 
</div>

<p>"This is but a glimpse of Nebraska as she is
materially; how is she in those departments of
activity which develop the higher nature of man;
which refine his thoughts and make him a force in
the dominion of taste and intellect? Six universities, tenty-nine colleges, seventeen academies, six thousand six hundred and ninety common
schools and seventy-five private schools educate
three hundred and sixty thousand of her sons and
daughters. This is Nebraska's day, and this
Exposition is her palace. As she steps to the main
entrance thereof to welcome her guests of the
Trans-Mississippi region, notice the inscription on
her shield. It illustrates the fact that she has the lowest rate of illiteracy of all 
the States of all this Union. The National Government has placed her percentage at 3.11.</p>

<p>"How appropriate, then, that the representatives of this Trans-Mississippi
region should select this State as the place herein to exhibit to the world their
best specimens of the triumph of mind over matter, and what specimens they are!</p>

<p>"If you would see a picture as beautiful as ever man created, contemplate the
grand court when illuminated at night. Go into the buildings, look at the evidence there of what man has done, and then say, if you will, that his achievements
in the Trans-Mississippi country have not been surpassingly great. But do not
be surprised, for in this region we possess the best blood and brains of our country,
From the East, and from every nation under the sun, have come to us energy,
independence of character and irresistible progressiveness that knows no halt until
it reaches its goal or the grave. From what race has sprung those men? The
Anglo-Saxon? Those who weep because we have not lords and castles and
crests and other evidences of barbarism, answer 'Yes.' Men who deal in facts
and not in fancies answer, 'No.' Read the names of those who perished with the

Maine, who supported the immortal Dewey, or who went into the jaws of death
with the heroic Hobson. ere they all Anglo-Saxon? Who will say so? Truth
declares that many races ere represented there. The Dane and the Swedish; the
Germans and the Irish. Shoulder to shoulder they stood behind the guns of their
adopted country, offered their lives on her altar, and thanked God that they were
Americans, the best race that ever blessed the earth, the combination of all that is
good in all the races of the world.</p>

<p>"Today Nebraska sends greetings to the oppressed of every race and of
every clime. To all, no matter of what race they come, who have energy, intelligence and industry, coupled with a love of freedom, she opens wide her gates
and bids them welcome. Here, under the blessings of our free institutions, and
breathing the air of the most healthful climate in the world, they will have their
energy stimulated, their industry rewarded, and their liberty protected."</p>

<p>WISCONSIN DAY—June 18, 1898</p>

<p>The program of exercises and comment on Wisconsin Day have been given
an appropriate place in Chapter III, Part I, of this History.</p>

<p>President John C. Koch, of the Wisconsin Commission, in his address,
referred to the fact that the dedication of Wisconsin building at the Exposition
marked also the celebration of the semi-centennial of Wisconsin's admission to the
Union of States. He spoke of the friendly relations which exist between Nebraska
and Wisconsin on account of the large numbers of natives of Wisconsin who have
taken up their residence in Nebraska. The history of the origin of the Wisconsin building
was reviewed briefly, and he, in a few words,
turned the building over to President Wattles
for the Exposition.

<p>President Wattles accepted the building
on behalf of the Exposition management and
dedicated it in honor of the semi-centennial
of Wisconsin's history as a state. Wisconsin
history as reviewed, briefly, referring to the
fact that in the original settlement of the
State the Germans predominated, as do their descendants today, and he declared
that their thrift, industry and reputation as good citizens have made the State
famous. The exceptional educational advantages possessed by the State were
referred to, and an array of figures regarding the agricultural and farm products
as quoted showing the great resources of the State. Reference as made
to the fact that the State had furnished enterprising citizens to many of the
western States, and the erection and dedication of the building on the
Exposition grounds declared a tie which would still further bind the to sections
together.</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. WILLIAM C. QUARLES</p>

<p>"Wisconsin men are found wherever true Americans dwell. Beyond the
Alleghenies and beyond the Rockies their influence is felt. No sooner have
their cabins been located in the wilderness than, as if by magic, all the institutions of civilization spring up about them.</p>

<p>"This Exposition is a great monument to the ability, energy, taste and
culture of the people of this broad Western land. It may well excite wonder and
admiration. As we behold these magnificent buildings and all the evidences of
wealth and culture, we can hardly realize that within the narrow span of a human
life this great prairie as a wilderness, ripening for future use, here every
autumn the dusky savage, in pursuit of game, roamed over vast stretches of
country, whose surface, clad in a mantle of sombre brown, undulated like the
billow of the sea. While we contemplate in Europe the fate of kingdoms that
have been tottering for ages on the brink of decay, slowly dying for a thousand
years, we behold our on States growing to maturity within the experience of
a generation.</p>

<p>"It is eminently fitting that Omaha, which so well represents the spirit of
Western advancement, should, at the consummation of the nineteenth century,
set up in its midst this magnificent object lesson. As we look: about us today,
we realize that we live in the heart of a republic whose shores touch either
ocean, which stretches from the frozen zone to the tropic lands, whose men and
women are the demigods of industrial and intellectual conquest, of and concerning whom it is not necessary that any man make explanation or apology, but
who stand upon the hilltops of civilization, with a national emblem representing
everything that is grand in human life and noble in human endeavor.</p>

<p>"In casting the eye over the map of Nebraska, we are thrilled with patriotic
joy to see among the names of your counties those of our Jefferson, Grant, Logan,
Blaine, Garfield, Sherman, Lincoln and Washington. We feel that our hearts
are thus linked together by the tie of common devotion to the precious memory
of our soldiers and patriots, whose fame is a common heritage, and we confidently
rest in the assurance that our children will unite with yours in the tribute of
gratitude due to those, who, whether at the north or south, east or West, have stood
or fallen in this country's cause.</p>

<p>"Few of us have realized the tremendous resources of our united country.
The world failed to appreciate it. The events of the last few months have amazed
foreign nations, as they have quickened the pulse of America with pride and
exultation.</p>

<p>"Wisconsin presents to Nebraska today, not merely a beautiful building,
as a token of her admiration and esteem, but as an older to a younger sister,
she extends to you affectionate and well-merited congratulations and the most
earnest wishes for the success of this, your great undertaking."</p>

<p>ILLINOIS DAY—June 20, 1898</p>

<p>For outline of exercises and program for the day see Chapter III, Part I,
of this History.</p>

<p>The addresses were as follows:</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF COLONEL CLARKE E. CARR,</p>

<p>President of the Illinois Commission.</p>

<p>"When La Salle was, with his heroic followers, exploring western wilds,
soon after leaving Lake Michigan he came to the head waters of a river upon
which he launched his canoes and floated down with the current. The river
broadened and deepened as he advanced, and he soon became convinced that it
belonged to the great system which drained all the vast region of the Northwest.

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Illinois State Building</p>
 
</div>

He made excursions upon either side and found himself in the midst of vast
meadows of waving grass which seemed illimitable. One day the party came
upon an Indian village and found it to be the home of a people who called themselves 'Illini.' He called the region the land of the 'Illini,' and he called the river
upon which he was floating the river of the 'Illini.' When he asked the significance of this name, he found it to be men, full-grown, complete, or, as we would
say, stalwart men. From this dusky race not only that river, but our great State
takes its name.</p>

<p>"There is scarcely an attribute of mankind so universal as that of affection
for the region in which our lot is cast; the land which has given us birth, or
which in maturer years has received us to her bosom. The heart of the Esquimaux, alike with the inhabitants of more favored regions, sells with the liveliest
emotions in contemplating what seems to him the beauties and excellencies of his

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.371.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.371.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.371.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

on country. If this emotion be a universal attribute to mankind, it can not
fail to be more profound and intense in proportion as those beauties and excellencies are real. There is no true son of Illinois 'whose heart has ne'er within
him burned' in contemplating the sublime glories of his on State.</p>

<p>"No other commonwealth can boast of more enterprising and prosperous cities
and tons and villages or of more delightful rural homes. Our great metropolis,
with her magnificent buildings towering into the skies, with her vast libraries
already provided for, with her university and institutes and schools, with her
charities and eleemosynary institutions, with her parks and great avenues, is
destined, with the growth of architecture and the development of art, to be the
most resplendent city on the face of the earth. Millions of revolving heels are
forever rolling to her great storehouse treasures, 'which far outshine the wealth
of Ormus and of Ind,' and she must very soon become the most opulent and
populous city of the Western hemisphere, and
finally of the world.</p>

<p>"But it is of our complete, stalwart men, that
we are proud. They have shown themselves
worthy of the name they bear. Men 'whose wrestling these can throw the world.' Scarcely had
the people of Illinois begun to enjoy the privileges
and appreciate the glories of full citizenship of the
Republic when almost immediately after the State
was admitted into the Union the demon of human
slavery tried to fasten itself upon them, Though
most of them ere from slave States, they met and
overcame the monster, and hurled it from them,
banishing it forever.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Clarke E. Carr</p>
 
</div>

<p>"A few years later, when borne down and
overwhelmed with debt and taxation, and the last
hope of being able to extricate themselves seemed gone, the siren of repudiation,
as she has successfully done elsewhere, beckoned them to follow her for relief.
They indignantly repelled her and deliberately, in their fundamental law, put upon
themselves a burden of taxation, and, after years of self-denial, paid the debt in
full, dollar for dollar. When the Mexican agricultural came Illinois carried the banner
of the Republic on many a victorious battlefield, and finally assisted in dictating
terms to the enemy in his on capital. when human slavery sought to fasten we
itself upon California and Kansas, Illinois men helped to drive it out. In the war
of the rebellion Illinois men 'heed their way don the Mississippi Valley with
their good swords,' as their greater volunteer leader, whose achievements have
been commemorated in bronze, said they would do, and the great river flowed
'unvexed to the sea.'</p>

<p>"The names of the stalwart sons of Illinois who have on imperishable
renown would fill volumes. One of them conquered the sword of rebellion, and,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.372.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.372.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.372.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

with magnanimity and generosity unequaled in history, declined to receive it, and
another is recognized throughout the world as the sublimest character of the age.</p>

<p>"While there is a tendency to exalt military genius above all other, there
have been intellectual conflicts in which the laurels have been as resplendent as
those which deck the soldier's brow. In the great debates before the people of
Athens, Demosthenes gained renown which has brought his name don through
all the ages.</p>

<p>"Just preceding the war of the rebellion, on the prairies of Illinois we witnessed a campaign of public discussion, continuing for several months. As it
progressed from day to day it attracted more and more attention, until finally all
the people of the nation became interested. The great prairies were the audience
room, the American people the audience, the Constitution of the United States 
the platform, the greatest American statesman the champion, and the fate of
a continent the issue.</p>

<p>"The original fabric of government as composed of States bordering upon
the Atlantic, of which the great State of Pennsylvania as appropriately designated as the keystone. Soon the adventurous and hardy pioneer subdued the
Western Wilds, new States were formed and the Republic expanded. By the
Louisiana purchase, the conquest of Mexico and the settlement of the Oregon
boundary, the domains of the Republic have extended until our boundaries are
the oceans. Her adamantine foundations, laid broad and deep, support the most
majestic edifice that has ever been projected.</p>

<p>"In the midst of this mighty structure so amplified and extended from its
original boundaries, Illinois appeared. Through the achievements and great
names of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, and the deeds of our other
statesmen and heroes, Illinois has so risen in her central position that from every
quarter of the Union men and omen instinctively lift their eyes to her, and so
carry out the no clearly discerned will of the Divine Architect. She unites and
cements, and canopies with grace and symmetry and beauty the majestic edifice.
As Pennsylvania as appropriately called the keystone, so Illinois may be
appropriately designated as the dome of the Republic of the United States.</p>

<p>"In the midst of this most splendid Exposition of the World's progress that
has ever been attempted and carried out in the Trans-Mississippi region, equal,
in so far as designed, to the World's Columbian Exposition and superior in many
of its details, Illinois has erected a building. In the work of laying out and
erecting this building the Illinois commissioners, representing every part of the
State, have taken a lively interest. It has been their desire, without unnecessary
outlay, to have a building that would be worthy of the State which has honored
them by placing the important trust in their hands. It has been a labor of love,
and they will feel amply compensated if their work is approved. For them and
in their behalf, I no turn the building over to His Excellency, the Governor of
Illinois, whom I have the honor to present to you.</p>

<p>"In introducing Governor Tanner, it is unnecessary for me to add more than
a word. Some of us have known him from the time when, a mere lad, he wore

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.373.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.373.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.373.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the blue uniform of his country. we do not always agree with him, but we
recognize his sterling qualities. He learned from Abraham Lincoln to be just
and kind and considerate, and he learned from General Grant to keep steadily
on in the line of duty, unmoved by denunciation on the one hand or by flattery
on the other, and he learned from John A. Logan, whose faithful and trusted
companion he as, never to desert a friend. He is one of the 'Illini.'"</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR JOHN R. TANNER OF ILLINOIS</p>

<p>"Mr. President of the Illinois Commission and Officers of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition: It affords me sincere pleasure, on behalf of the State of Illinois
as its Governor and executive head, to receive from the distinguished and genial
President of the Illinois Commission this commodious and elegant building.
which is not surpassed, I believe, in point of beauty or convenience, by any similar
structure upon these capacious grounds. It is a building of which the great State
I have the honor here to represent may be justly
proud, and I trust that many Illinoisans may see it,
rest beneath its hospitable roof, and share the sentiment of admiration and approval with which I view it for the first time.</p>

<p>"The people of Illinois have the most cordial
and Sympathetic feeling for the State of Nebraska
and its citizens. They are largely the same people,
since Illinois has contributed so largely to populate
these virgin and fertile plains. I see in this
audience of brave men and fair women many a
spectator and listener who was born in Illinois,
but for one reason or another has cast his or her
lot with a younger community. To no other State

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Gov. John R. Tanner</p>
 
</div>

in the Union, I think, have we given so many of
our sons and daughters. we cherish the belief
that even Nebraska can show none better. They are gone from us, but they are
still of us. Their memories are cherished by those whom they have left behind,
many of whom will take this opportunity to renew old ties of affection and friend-
ship. It is this common blood flowing through all our veins, much of it from the
founders of England and Virginia and the Carolinas, but all of it, whether its
original source as in England, Ireland, Germany or elsewhere, no thoroughly
and forever American, which is the promise, the pledge of perpetual union, of
p every portion of our common country.</p>

<p>"The mention of our country at this moment of national peril and anxiety
thrills every patriotic heart. It is hard for us, far removed as we are from the
island shores in to hemispheres here our destiny is even no being shaped
to some unseen end by the thunderbolts of agricultural, to command our thoughts and
hold them to the peaceful scenes which at home greet our view. In imagination

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.374.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.374.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.374.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

and sympathy we are only partly here. Our hearts are with our bravest and
dearest in camp or at sea, here the children of Illinois and the children of
Nebraska have joined hands to purchase, for an alien race, at the cost of their
own lives, if so great a sacrifice is required of them, the liberty and prosperity
which we ourselves enjoy, and of which this magnificent Exposition is the latest
and highest symbol. What a contrast! May we not derive from it the lesson that
greater are the triumphs of peace than of agricultural? agricultural is destructive, but peace
is a creative force.</p>

<p>"As I look around me, I pray for the restoration of peace, a just and honorable peace, a lasting peace, which shall usher in for all mankind a brighter era
of humanity and universal brotherhood. we can never be again what we have
been—an isolated nation, selfishly enjoying our immunity from international
responsibilities. we have a duty to discharge to the world as ell as to ourselves,
and the destruction of the Maine with its gallant crew as the rude voice which
awakened us from our dream of perpetual exemption from entanglement with the
affairs of other nations, and aroused us to a higher conception of our duty as
to the pioneers of the new Christian civilization which is to characterize the
coming century.</p>

<p>"But I have led away from the matter in hand. As Governor of the State
of Illinois, I congratulate the commission which has so well performed the task
assigned to it, of preparing and presenting a fit testimonial of our friendly regard
for a sister State, and our cordial sympathy with its noble ambitions.</p>

<p>"I thank you for what you have done, and no, in the name of this commission, and on behalf of the people of Illinois, I tender to the officials in charge
of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, this edifice for the use of all who may enjoy
its hospitality, whether they be Nebraskans, Illinoisans, or from whatever State
or land they may come. Let Illinois and Nebraska vie with each other which
of the two shall give them the warmer welcome."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT GURDON WATTLES</p>

<p>"When the Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress designated the city of
Omaha as the place at which the country beyond the Mississippi should display
to the world its resources in the year 1898, and when the officers of this Exposition had been elected, we naturally turned to our neighbors of Illinois for 
assistance and advice. we recognized, as all must acknowledge, that Chicago
had furnished the ideal of all future expositions; that none could excel and few
could ever equal that grand achievement of human skill and genius, the 'World's
Columbian Fair.' In architecture, arrangement and installation, as well as in
the excellence, variety and magnitude of the exhibits, we realized we could only
produce a shadow of that which had reached so near perfection at Chicago.</p>

<p>"It gives me great pleasure in the presence of His Excellency, the Governor
of Illinois, and in the presence of these distinguished guests, to acknowledge the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.375.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.375.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.375.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

hearty cooperation we have received from the officers of the World's Fair Commission and the valuable assistance of the State of Illinois in this enterprise. Our
invitation to your State to participate in this Exposition as promptly accepted,
an appropriation as made by your legislature and a beautiful and appropriate if
building has been erected on these grounds. I can not refrain from commending
the efficient work done by your commissioners. Their building is one of which
the State may well be proud; they have furnished it with comforts and conveniences, and have embellished with an artist's dream of the 'White City' in a
manner which can not fail to meet the approval of every loyal citizen. This building is an honor to the State, Illinois, and a credit to the Exposition, and for the
management I accept it and dedicate it to the comfort and happiness of the
citizens and all former residents of your great State.</p>

<p>"We of the vast Trans-Mississippi region renew this day our allegiance
and good-will to the State of Illinois, and acknowledge our appreciation of the
presence of her Governor and distinguished citizens here on this occasion. We
are proud of her history, her wealth, and of her great men; we are proud of her
great metropolis, the growth and development of which have been an index to the
progress of the entire West. The prosperity of Illinois and of her metropolis is
intimately associated with the prosperity of the Trans-Mississippi country.
Chicago is the great clearing-house for the larger part of the surplus grain and
stock produced in the West. The value of her yearly commerce in the necessities of life can hardly be comprehended. It exceeds the foreign exports of the
United States. It exceeds the entire animal gold and silver product of the world.
It exceeds the enormous sum of one billion dollars. For the product of the West
which yearly Ends a market in the State of Illinois, her lines of railroad, which
radiate to all parts of this country, return annually agricultural implements to
the value of tenty-Eve million dollars, clothing to the value of fifty million
dollars, boots and shoes to the value of ten million dollars, and the products of
her other factories in proportion. So active have become the demands of this
rapidly developing, pushing, thriving new territory, that the delay incident to
the purchase from factories in New England can not longer be tolerated, and
the time is not far distant when the older States of the West will supply themselves and their sister States with all their needs. The State of Illinois is rapidly
becoming a manufacturing center for the West. The census of 1890 showed an
increase of 119 per cent in her manufacturing interests in ten years. Three
hundred and twelve thousand one hundred and ninety-eight hands were then
employed, and the value of the annual product of her factories as nine hundred
and eight million six hundred and forty thousand dollars. I have no doubt that
the next census will show a corresponding increase.</p>

<p>"But, bound together as we are by the ties of commercial interest, there are
other cords that will forever hold us as brothers.</p>

<p>"The richest heritage of the past century is the men which Illinois has
given to history. They belong to this and all other Western States. They were

the product of Western environment. Only the boundless prairies, the free air
and the blue skies of the West could have developed them. We have perpetuated
their names in our counties, cities and tons, and for the greatest and best of them
all we have named our capital city. They have made the State of Illinois
renowned in eloquence, learning, statesmanship and jurisprudence. Douglas,
the great tribune; Baker, the sweet-toned orator; Cartright, the rugged divine;
Trumbull, the constitutional layer; Shields, the hero of to wars; Drummond,
the eminent judge; Logan, the 'Black Eagle,' who carried victory in his fiery
train; Oglesby, the unconquerable soldier and wise statesman; Grant, the
invincible leader of armies, the peerless hero and the greatest general of the
century; Lincoln, who stood at the helm of the nation during the darkest hour
of its peril and sealed its triumph with his blood. We claim an interest in them
all, and their memory must forever bind the State of Illinois with bonds of steel
to the younger States of the West.</p>

<p>We appreciate beyond expression this visit of your Governor and these
distinguished Illinois citizens at this particular time. when agricultural as first
declared with Spain the managers of this Exposition had some fears that it
might detract from the success of our enterprise, but we have come to realize
that blessings are often given in disguise. We now know that while war destroys,
it also gives new life and that every citizen is energized by the new and patriotic
influences that are revived by conflict and strife. No better illustration of the
greatness and power of our country can be found than in the fact that thousands
of citizens from Eastern States daily visit this Exposition, and that while our
antagonist—one of the oldest kingdoms in the world—is straining every resource if to meet in unequal combat our magnificent forces at Manila and Santiago, that
while the bonds of Spain are begging a market at thirty cents on the dollar,
our nation's war loan will be three times over-subscribed by our on citizens, and
that we will not only defeat at arms this dying relic of barbarism, but at the
same time will hold here in the center of our territory a great Exposition
illustrating the arts of peace and promoting good will throughout the land.</p>

<p>"Illinois is bound to the West by ties of consanguinity and common interest.
Thousands of her former citizens are no residents of this and other Western
States; they are among our most progressive and prominent men in all departments of business and professional life. Her beautiful home here will renew old
friendships and form new ones. I commend the wisdom of its erection, the beauty
of its design and the friendly interest which prompted its conception. For the
management of the Exposition I receive and dedicate it to the purpose for which
it as designed."</p>

<p>A KANSAS DAY—June 22, 1898</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. J. E. FROST,</p>

<p>Vice-President of the Kansas Commission.</p>

<p>"May 30, A. D. 1854, as an eventful day. It marked the beginning of an
epoch in the history of our nation which, in its achievement, makes it possible for
us to meet here today to dedicate this building as a part of this great Exposition
of the resources, development and boundless promise of the mighty West.</p>

<p>"On that notable day Congress passed the act creating the tin territories
of Nebraska and Kansas, and while the statesmen of that day undoubtedly foresaw
a great future for this then unpeopled region, who could have foreseen this
marvelous growth which the to States have attained in the half century that
has since elapsed? 'What prophetic vision could have revealed the scenes
that surround us here today, within the boundaries of the territory carved out of
a vast wilderness? The twin territories become States, have grown side by side
in close friendship and generous rivalry, surpassing in their attainment the fondest
hopes of their creators, and today they clasp hands, while Kansas renders ready
tribute to the prowess of her sister State, so exemplified in the splendid creations
with which we are surrounded.</p>

<p>"I esteem it a great pleasure, a high privilege, on behalf of the Kansas Commission and of our fellow-citizens of the Sunflower State, to welcome to the dedication of the Kansas State building our friends who honor us with their presence this morning. we congratulate the managers of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition upon their daring spirit and matchless pluck in conceiving and undertaking this great enterprise, and upon their tireless energy and skillful management in putting it in successful operation. We most cordially welcome the representatives of Nebraska and of Missouri and of Iowa and of the great Northwest, and of the great Southwest, of the Rocky Mountain region and of the Pacific slope, component parts of this magnificent Trans-Mississippi domain; we welcome our friends

from Illinois, which great mother has sent to both
Kansas and Nebraska a greater proportion of her
population than any other State in the Union; we welcome those from the
Buckeye, the Badger and the Hoosier States and from the grand old Empire
State, from stanch Ne England, the Sunny South and from all the others.
From whatever State or territory, 'One for all and all for one,' you are all
Kansans by adoption today."</p>

<p>In his response, President Wattles reviewed briefly the marvelous progress
which had been made in the prairie States of the West during the last half
century, eclipsing the progress of any other section in a similar time. In
commenting on this condition he spoke of the peculiar propriety of holding a
great exposition to display to the world the magnificent resources of this great
region. He complimented the people of Kansas on the fine showing which had
been made of the resources of their State, and especially on account of the
handsome and commodious State building which had been erected for the
accommodation of the people from the Sunflower State. The grand results
of the efforts of the Commission and the State officers of Kansas in raising funds
for the exhibit of the resources of the State ere commended in high terms,
and the promise of the future, as indicated by the energy and ability shown by
the State in this instance, ere cited by the speaker as most encouraging.
The resources and products of the State ere discussed somewhat in detail,
and in conclusion he expressed the hope that the investment made in the
Exposition would be returned to the State a thousand fold.</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. SILAS PORTER, OF WYANDOTTE</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: This is Kansas Day, a Kansas
audience and a Kansas building. Kansas and Nebraska are renewing today an
acquaintance formed forty years ago, when as infants they ere rocked in the
same cradle, and the name of one as never mentioned without the other. In the
history of the great conflict against the extension of slavery in the new territories
of the Northwest, their names became forever associated, and the acquaintance
formed so early has ripened into a arm friendship. They have kept step
together in the grand march of progress, and today their interests are common.</p>

<p>"Kansas congratulates her young sister upon this magnificent Exposition
and her tireless energy and genius in creating here a fitting memorial of the
history and development of the great Trans-Mississippi territory.</p>

<p>We have come to throw open the doors of this beautiful building, which
represents in a measure the dignity and hospitality of our State, and to write
over these doors a message of royal welcome to all Kansas friends who may
have occasion to meet here.</p>

<p>"Kansas is the central State. Her area exceeds that of New England,
and her population is about equal to that of the city of Chicago, so that every
Kansan has plenty of elbow room. The State is to hundred miles wide, four
hundred miles long, and all sunshine. Today that sunshine falls upon a wheat
field of four million acres, the southern edge of which is ripening for the
harvest. General Fremont, in his report to the Government, in 1850, said
that the fertile district of Kansas ended abruptly about one hundred miles west
of the Missouri River. 'Beyond,' he said, 'it is wholly unfit for agricultural
purposes and must ever remain so.' A single county lying more than one

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.379.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.379.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.379.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

hundred miles West of Fremont's limit produced last year eight million bushels
of corn and yields each year, upon the average, more corn than any other county
in the United States. The 'Great American Desert' is covered with magnificent
farms and orchards, the homes of a contented and prosperous people.</p>

<p>"The Kansan is loyal to his State; he acquires the habit of thinking of his
State as something real, of identifying himself with her past history, her present
fortunes and her future destiny. And once a Kansan, always a Kansan. To
him the sun always shines a little brighter there. If some occasion has arisen
necessitating his removal to another place, he looks forward anxiously to the
time when he shall again reside within her borders.</p>

<p>"Kansas is both the best and worst advertised State. Her name is always
in the newspapers. Any paragraph about Kansas is as sure of being republished
as though it ere followed by the words 'All papers please copy.'  with it all, the
State has suffered from an undeserved and undesired notoriety. The marvelous
speculation in real estate, which reached its climax

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Silas W. Porter</p>
 
</div>

about ten years ago, proved a more costly experience than all the accumulated disasters in Kansas a history. when reason returned and liquidation if began, conditions ere most unfavorable. Distrust prevailed in financial circles everywhere; a period of depression in all lines of business almost unparalleled set in; low prices and, worst of all, a partial failure of crops, resulted in many Kansas obligations going to protest. The Eastern man with money to lend as largely at fault. He believed that values would continue to rise, and he frequently loaned up to the limit of speculative values. Kansas loans, made with any pretense of judgment, have proven safe investments.</p>

<p>"Kansas laws for the protection of the rights of the debtor class have been
persistently misunderstood. Editors of newspapers in eastern States, here the
las for a hundred years have given the mortgagor from one to two years equity
of redemption, have railed at the dishonesty of the Kansas law giving the
mortgagor eighteen months to redeem. But Kansas is not the only State here
men lost their heads in real estate speculation. The bankruptcy measure is
not being pushed through Congress to aid Kansas bankrupts alone.</p>

<p>"The State has much to be proud of. within her borders general prosperity
reigns. The wise man who prayed that he might be given neither poverty nor
riches would find in Kansas an ideal home. We have no millionaires and no
poverty. The State is long on schools and academies and short on jails and
poorhouses. Her school fund is richer than a 'king's ransom,' and she makes
the proud boast that the percentage of illiteracy among her people is less than

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.380.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.380.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.380.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

that of any other State or province or country in the world. And so it happened,
very naturally, that of her three thousand soldiers enlisted last month, every
one can read and rite. Her patriotism is as strong today as in the sixties,
when she furnished more volunteers in proportion to her population than any
other State.</p>

<p>"This building is only a temporary structure, but it stands, for the time, for
Kansas. Let us dedicate it to the memory of the brave men who founded and
preserved the State, the loyal, generous-hearted men who gave the best efforts
of their lives to make Kansas a free State, an outpost of freedom planted upon
the frontier of civilization, and those others who came after and helped to preserve
her free institutions as a priceless heritage for us and our posterity. But in a
we broader sense, let us dedicate it to the Kansas that we know—the new Kansas,
the prosperous Kansas, without ache or pain or cause of complaint; the Kansas
with nothing whatever 'the matter with her,' where the Indian and the buffalo
are traditions of the past, here the grasshopper long ago ceased to be a burden;
to debt-paying Kansas, with money of her on to lend; Kansas from which
the prairie dog has gone to join the calamity howler; Kansas with to millions
of prosperous people and ample room for ten millions more.</p>

<p>"War is not an unmixed evil. In seasons of long peace men forget their
country in pursuit of wealth and agricultural. 'The many fail, the few succeed
Those who succeed become more selfish and grasping; those who fail, discontented.
Discontent breeds social disorder. The demagogue sees his opportunity and
anarchy and socialism are advocated; distrust prevails, and men lose faith in a
government. At such times a foreign war in a just cause is a blessing. And we
if the revival of patriotism which we see all about us shall drive out all traces
of sectionalism forever, if it shall lead men to consider the welfare of their country
and to lose sight of selfish ends, if it shall result in seeping away the social
disorders which seemed to threaten the stability of our institutions, it will prove
to be worth all it costs in blood and treasure. And Kansans know that our
State will gain as much by this revival of patriotism as any portion of the Union.
"Kansas believes in the destiny of the Anglo-Saxon to accomplish grand
results in the cause of human liberty, in the interests of civilization against
despotism. The time may come when outrages in America shall cease at the
command of the Anglo-Saxon. We need have no fear of a standing army made
up of our sons and brothers. And the navy! No longer it belongs to the seacoast States. Since the first of May the hole country, north and south, east
and West, has claimed it. Hereafter, the Western Congressman who votes
against an appropriation designed to strengthen that arm of the service will
have to explain his vote to his constituents."</p>

<p>IOWA DEDICATION DAY—June 23, 1898</p>

<p>Iowa Day has been given appropriate consideration in Chapter III, Part I,
of this History, as one of the historical days of the Exposition. The addresses
of the day were as follows:</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT S. H. MALLORY,</p>

<p>of the Iowa Commission.</p>

<p>After dwelling at some length upon former expositions, both in the United
States and abroad, he said:</p>

<p>"Iowa, the beautiful land, the garden of agriculture, with her fifty-live thousand square miles of rich, fertile, tillable land, traversed with clear, running
streams, a veritable paradise, as less than one hundred years ago untrodden by
the foot of the white man, her ownership resting in Spain, her beauties unknown,
her boundaries not established until 1820. Born into a family of States less than
fifty-to years ago, or about thirteen years after the first cabin as built by a white
man in her borders, Iowa no has her whole area dotted with colleges, academies, we
schools and churches; a population of over two
million, and is bound together by eight thousand
five hundred miles of steel, her railroads touching
the capital of every county in her domain but one,
and serving with her wide rivers on the eastern
and Western borders to carry her vast productions
to the markets of the world.</p>

<p>"Iowa, with a soil producing all standard
grains, grasses, vegetables and fruits in abundance,
is an agricultural State, standing first in the
Union of States with her crop of corn, and fourth
in the production of all agricultural products. Yet,
with her inexhaustible deposits of coal, her metallic

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>S. H. Mallory </p>
 
</div>

ores of lead, zinc and iron, she offers large opportunities and possibilities for prominence as a manufacturing State. Thus Iowa comes in company
with her sister States, not with a spirit of envy, but of friendly emulation, with
her quota of exhibits. Her people, by and through legislative enactment, appropriated the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars to aid in furnishing an exhibit of
her varied industries and resources worthy of the State at this Trans-Mississippi
Exposition, and this building, erected under the supervision of the commission
appointed by the Governor of the State in furtherance of the object sought by the
people of the State, I, as Chairman of the Commission, no tender to you,
Governor Shaw, that you may dedicate it to the use and purpose for which it
as designed.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.382.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.382.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.382.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"The contract for the construction of this beautiful home of the people of
Iowa, and their neighbors and friends of sister States, as awarded to P. H.
Wind, of Council Bluffs, for the sum of seven thousand seven hundred and
ninety-five dollars, sixty-three days ago. A few years since, six months would
have been considered a short time to erect such a structure. Mr. Wind is entitled
to great credit for the energy displayed in rushing the work to completion in spite
of the elements. The plans for the building ere prepared by Josselyn and
Taylor Company, of Cedar Rapids.</p>

<p>"The Commission desires to express its obligations to President Wattles
for the many courtesies shown, and for the assistance rendered in the prosecution
the work. President Wattles and his able corps of assistants are entitled to
great praise for the conception, planning and construction of this beautiful city,
and we predict it will be the most successful Exposition yet held."</p>

<p>Governor Shaw accepted the building in the name of the State, and turned
it over to the Exposition in the following brief address:</p>

<p>"The State of Iowa, through its representatives, accepts at the hands of the
Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission, this building,
designed by its direction and erected under its supervision. It may not be
inappropriate to tarry in this presence to make public acknowledgment of the
faithful and expeditious service thus rendered by the members of this Commission;
services sure to be appreciated by those at whose behest they ere performed.
And no, as the representative of the people of the State of Iowa, I hereby
dedicate this edifice to the purposes for which it as designed, and commit the
same to the care, custody and use of the President and management of the Trans-
Mississippi and International Exposition, in the hope that it may add somewhat
to the interest and comfort of those who may visit these spacious grounds, and
enjoy the trophies of State and national prosperity and greatness."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT GURDON W. WATTLES</p>

<p>"During the last ten days, it has been my official duty and pleasure to speak
of the resources, progress and splendid achievements of a number of Western
States at the dedicatory exercises of the buildings they have erected on these
grounds. I may be pardoned for the sentiments of pride and gratification
feel today, and for the expression of these sentiments in the few words I shall
say regarding the State in which tenty-five years of my life as spent, and in
the acknowledgment I desire to make of the assistance of this State to the
great enterprise I have the honor to represent.</p>

<p>"During the early history of this Exposition, when doubt still lingered in
the minds of many as to its advantages and possibilities, and while the dark clouds
of financial embarrassment and the devastating effects of drouth still hung
over the West, casting their gloom over all the new enterprises, and for the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.383.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.383.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.383.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

time obscuring the sunlight of hope and prosperity, at this time, when many 
of our on citizens, discouraged and disheartened, ere ready to abandon this
enterprise, when our nation as borrowing gold from Europe to protect its
credit, and when the evil influences of inflation and speculation had destroyed,
for the time, the financial reputation of the West, then it as that the legislature
of the great State of Iowa, the first of all the Trans-Mississippi States to act, by
joint resolution, asked the Congress of the United States to recognize this
Exposition and make an appropriation for a Government building and an exhibit
here. To this act of the General Assembly of Iowa, supplemented by the efficient
work of your representatives in Congress, must be given the credit of having
extended this Exposition a helping hand in the time of need.</p>

<p>"The Commission appointed to represent the State of Iowa here has done
its work with credit to itself and the State. This magnificent building, with its
broad verandas, artistic design and complete appointments, speaks louder than
words, in praise of their worth. It will furnish a home for the weary, a meeting
place for friends, and will return to the State a thousand fold the cost, in
promoting the interests of the State and advertising the enterprise and hospitality
of its people throughout the land. I commend its design, the completeness
of its appointments, the wisdom of its conception, and for the management of
this Exposition I accept and dedicate it to the purposes for which it as erected.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>W. B. Allison, United States Senator</p>
 
</div>

<p>"We naturally expect from such a State eloquence like that of Cousins and
Dolliver, statesmanship like that of Allison and Gear, philanthropy like that of
Drake, leadership like that of the Clarksons and
executive ability like that of Kirkwood, Boies and
Shaw; and while in the history of the State of
Iowa there are no Lincolns, Grants or Shermans,
its history is replete with the names of many whose
wisdom and statesmanship in times of peace and
courage and leadership in times of war have
rendered to the nation services invaluable. During
the late rebellion, her soldiers ere distinguished
for their bravery and endurance. These men were
gathered from the farms of this then pioneer State,
and they were endowed with the splendid physique
and the intelligence and morality which pioneer
life on the broad prairies of the West inspires.
Their bravery in battle, their endurance and the
ability of their leaders, as second to that of no
other Northern State. And so we are not surprised when we read that among
the gallant crew that went down with the battleship 'The Maine' the names
of several men from Iowa are found; nor are we surprised that when from
four thousand brave soldiers a crew as selected to man a ship that as to
sail into the harbor of Santiago to face the fire of the Spanish guns and meet
almost certain death, one of Iowa's sons as chosen.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.384.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.384.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.384.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"It might be said that a State with such magnificent resources, with such
a history and with such a people, would have no need to advertise to the
world at an Exposition of this character, but when we consider that with the
same density of population as the State of Massachusetts, Iowa can provide
homes for fifteen millions of inhabitants, and when we consider that but a
small percentage of the manufactures consumed in the State are manufactured
there, that with the increase of wealth and population a higher civilization than
has ever been known in the world will come from the environments of citizenship
under the advantages which already exist within this State, we can realize the
importance and necessity of promoting and developing these resources to the
fullest extent."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. JOHN N. BALDWIN</p>

<p>"As I wandered through the Exposition buildings and strolled over these
grounds, I heard orators proclaiming from the exedra, the plaza and rostrums
in State buildings the glories and triumphs of their respective States. One
evening after a storm I stood on the bridge of the lagoon, but a few feet distant
from the spot here, only a year ago, we laid the cornerstone of this great
enterprise, and beholding this mighty monument to the skill, courage and enterprise
of the men of Nebraska, I thought, what has Iowa, or what has Iowa done, to
compare with this?</p>

<p>"I came Nebraska Day, and heard that distinguished citizen of the Republic,
whose heart is love and tongue tipped with silver, eloquently present the record
of the resources and progress of Nebraska. I came Illinois Day, and heard the
representatives of that great commonwealth give their report of the work and
worth of Illinois, concluding with the claim to the undisputed title to the possession
of the third greatest commercial center of the world. I imagined that on New
York Day, Bourke Cochran would so portray the history and glories of the
great State of New York that we should all seem to hear the sybils chanting
the springtime of the greatest empire on earth. Again I thought, What has
Iowa, or what has Iowa done, to compare with all these?</p>

<p>"Reflecting on all that I had seen and heard and imagined, I venerated my
office and would have despaired of my performance, had not the power of
my subject made me bold in such a presence to plead my thoughts. It would
be the drivel of idiocy, unbecoming a gentleman and unworthy of the State,
should I on this occasion make any statement not based upon careful investigation,
and not founded upon incontrovertible facts. I no and here assert, my heart
beating with pride at the utterance, that, measured by the standard of religion,
education, prosperity, patriotism, liberty or any great principle or idea that makes
men better, nobler and happier, Iowa, in the Union of States, is the peer of all,
superior to many and excelled by none.</p>

<p>"We dedicate today this beautiful building to the uses and purposes of the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. It is merely a type of the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.385.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.385.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.385.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

habitations of our people at the present time. A few feet from here, and within
your vision, stands a Wigwam, which has just been opened. It, too, is a type—a
type. of the habitations of our people fifty-two years ago. You can not but
recognize the significance of the change. The advancement, improvement and
progress of the people of the State of Iowa in education, religion and material
interests have been as striking as that in their habitations.</p>

<p>"This great State, with its wondrous destinies, is no in the hands of the
younger and present generation. It belongs to us to protect, preserve and improve.
we must take up the work here the pioneers were compelled to let it go. They
placed high the standard. Let us never lower it. Let us look up and listen;
look forward and move. Let our every action be prompted and performed in
accordance with that design created by one of the greatest philosophers and poets:</p>

<span class="lg poem">

<span class="l">"Build thee more stately mansions, Oh my soul,</span>
<span class="l">As the sift seasons roll.</span>
<span class="l">Leave thy low-vaulted past.</span>
<span class="l">Let each new temple, nobler than the last,</span>
<span class="l">Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,</span>
<span class="l">Till thou at length art free,</span>
<span class="l">Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea.</span></span>

<p>"I propose this sentiment: The State of Iowa, with a people possessing
affections deeper, even, than her soil; actuated by purposes broader, even, than
is her prayer, and inspired by aims loftier than her hills, she stands today first
in the Union of States in general contentment, in more evenly distributed wealth,
and in universal prosperity."</p>

<p>DEDICATION OF THE WIGWAM</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. VICTOR JENNINGS,</p>

<p>Mayor of Council Bluffs.</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen: We have met here today to dedicate to the uses
of this great and grand Exposition this contribution from Pottawatamie County
and the City of Council Bluffs. As the head of the municipal organization of
that city, it becomes my duty, as it is my pleasure, to speak for her on this
occasion.</p>

<p>"To those familiar with the beauties of Council Bluffs, who know of its 
enterprise and thrift, who are proud to claim a place in its citizenship, it is
unnecessary for me to enter into details. To those, however, who simply know
that there is a city called Council Bluffs, but who have not tested its hospitalities
nor witnessed the unfolding of its many and varied industries, it affords me
gratification to say that within gunshot of this spot, yet hidden almost completely
by its 'eternal hills,' lies a city of thirty thousand intelligent, industrious,
contented and happy people. It is the capital City of the largest county in the
State—a county containing five hundred and eighty-two thousand one hundred

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.386.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.386.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.386.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

and fifty-six acres of the richest land on the face of the globe. It is second,
if, indeed, it is not the first, city in the world in the magnitude of its agricultural
implement trade. 'Implement Row' comprises blocks upon blocks of mammoth
warehouses, into which the railroads from the East pour trainloads of implements
daily, and out of which these same goods go daily by the dozen lines of railroads
to almost every quarter-section of this great Trans-Mississippi territory. It is
a city of schools and churches, and its educational and moral tone is second
to no city of its size in the United States. It is a city of fair omen and brave
men, as attested by the avidity with which its daughters are taken from the
homes of their parents to homes of which they are the inspiration and the head,
and the number of soldier boys it has contributed to Uncle Sam's armies.</p>

<p>"The city of Council Bluffs, anxious to contribute in a material way to the
success of this Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, and because of
its nearness feeling almost a proprietary interest in it, unanimously determined,
almost at the inception of this great undertaking, the fruition of which we are
witnessing today, to be fittingly represented here. This determination led to
the purchase of stock of the Exposition, to the calling of public meetings, and
the organization of an association whose duty it should be to see to it that
Council Bluffs should be seen and known by all who came within these enchanted
grounds during the period of the Exposition. It as a difficult task assigned
to these men, but nobly have they discharged it.</p>

<p>"The Wigwam tells better than can words of mine the wonderful, the
miraculous development of the Trans-Mississippi country. The footfall of the
red man following his well-known trails has given place to the whir of the
electric motor as it moves along the glistening lines of steel. The smoke of the 'wigwam' has faded away before the smoke of factory and forge. The silence
of national peace has gone forever, succeeded by the never-ending hum of
industry. The plains and valleys are no longer the waste places of the earth, if but have been made the garden spots and granaries of the world.</p>

<p>"To the purpose of the Exposition, this Wigwam is today dedicated. To the
city which gives it in part, I cordially invite you. The trails are plainer than they were a half century ago, and the hearts of our people, like the doors of their 'wigwams,' are ever open to you. We want you to come and break bread
with us, smoke with us the pipe of peace, rest body and mind in the prettiest
parks between the to ranges of mountains, and going back over the years, find
a new meaning in Longfellow's lines:</p>

<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">Very spacious as the wigwam,</span>
<span class="l">Made of deerskin dressed and whitened,</span>
<span class="l">With the gods of the Dakotas</span>
<span class="l">Drawn and painted in its curtains."</span></span>

<p>SWEDISH-AMERICAN DAY—June 24, 1898</p>

<p>Swedish-American Day as one on which the visitors from the East were
given an object lesson well worth their while in having taken the time from
their busy avocations, and incurred the expense of the long journey to witness
and study the evidences of development in the Trans-Mississippi territory. The
emigrants from the "Land of the Midnight Sun" to this land of freedom and
prosperity had not tarried in the East, but, following the instincts of their bright mental inheritance from their sturdy forefathers, had drifted into the West. The early days of their emigration were coincident with the commencement of the marvelous development of railway construction after the close of the civil war, in the Trans-Mississippi territory, and there they found lucrative employment at ages which, compared with ages in their on country, made them wealthy and independent, in their own estimation, at the outset. Acquiring, under such circumstances, the means they required, they forged on to the boundless agricultural regions which were then to be purchased for the pittance of the expense of filing and recording the necessary applications and evidences of title from the United States Government in the latitude and in the climate of their native land. Quietly and unostentatiously they had taken possession of
certain districts, until they had become a agricultural recognized as entitled to full representation in their rights as American citizens, and withal adopted as among the most useful and aggressive factors in the development of this great land. It as fitting that a day should be set apart for this people in order that the world might see and know the possibilities in this land of the free.</p>

<p>The day as spent in enjoyment of the varied sight-seeing and amusement
features of the Grand Court, the exhibits and the Midway. To the exercises
of the day the evening as dedicated.</p>

<p>The festival of song, which as held in the Auditorium, as the principal
feature of the exercises, and attracted one of the largest audiences which had
occupied that structure since the opening of the Exposition. There as not a
vacant seat on the lower floor, and very few remaining in the gallery, when the
exercises commenced.</p>

<p>The front of the stage as prettily decorated with palms and other foliage
plants, and these, with the bunting hung from the ceiling and about the front
of the gallery, gave the interior of the great building a festival appearance in
keeping with the character of the occasion. Flags in profusion were used in the
decoration, "Old Glory" predominating, and the national colors of Sweden being
on every side. At the front of the stage sat the speakers of the evening and the
jubilee Committee which had arranged the great celebration, including the
following Swedish-American citizens of Omaha: C. O. Lobeck, President;
T. H. Johnson, Vice-President; T. G. Northall, Treasurer; John S. Helgren,
Secretary; C. W. Johnson, C. W. Anderson and Albin Liljegren. Back of these,
extending tier upon tier to the great organ rearing its lofty front at the back

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.388.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.388.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.388.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of the stage, sat the Swedish Jubilee Chorus of to hundred and nine voices,
made up of members of choirs from all the surrounding country. The body
presented a pleasing appearance, with the omen in dresses of light colors in
various shades, while the men all appeared in black.</p>

<p>The exercises were opened by President C. O. Lobeck, who presented
President Wattles of the Exposition, who briefly said that he realized that the
company had come to hear music, not speeches. He contented himself with
bidding the people welcome to the white City and inviting them to come again
and carefully inspect the many things which had been collected to educate the
people of the world regarding the vast resources of the West.</p>

<p>President Lobeck then introduced the chairman of the evening, Rev. A.
Lofgren, of Lincoln, Presiding Elder of the Swedish Methodist Church, who
made a short address in Swedish, saying it as highly fitting that a day which
had been so auspicious should be closed with a feast of song. He said that every
good Swede rejoices in every success of American arms, and they also rejoice
in every triumphal advance made by science and education. He characterized
the Exposition as a great exemplification of the triumph of the good and pure in
life, and complimented the management which had brought about such good
results. The speaker also referred to the fortuitous circumstances which had
resulted in bringing together the representatives of the various denominations
in a grand celebration of a national feast day, and expressed the hope that this
was only the beginning of a grand era of harmony, when all the natives of the
old fatherland shall be united by a bond of unity and common interest.</p>

<p>The first choral number as the psalm CL, and the volume of sound which
was called forth at the bid of the baton wielded by Professor Edgren fulfilled
the anticipations of the audience. The chorus as well balanced, and the manner
in which the selection as rendered spoke volumes for the capabilities of the
singers and the vigorous training required to produce such unison of execution
in the short time the many sections comprising the choir had been together.</p>

<p>The next number as a soprano solo by Miss Emma Moeller, of Omaha.
She sang the recitative and aria, "with Verdure Clad," from Haydn's "Creation."
She as enthusiastically applauded and presented with a large bunch of American
Beauty roses, responding with an encore which as also vigorously applauded.</p>

<p>A male chorus, "Hear Us, Svea," as the next number, and then Rev.
J. A. Hultman, formerly of Omaha, but no a resident of Chicago, as announced
to sing a baritone solo. He as greeted with a perfect ovation, the applause
being hearty and prolonged, continuing for several minutes, during which the
singer acknowledged the arm welcome from his old friends by frequent bows.
Quiet as finally restored, and he began his song. Time had only served to
strengthen and improve the rich quality of a beautiful voice, and the breathless
attention which prevailed during the singing as succeeded by a burst of applause
which shook the house. For several minutes the applause continued, and only
when it as seen that the singer as about to respond with another song did.
the enthusiasm subside. "Jerusalem" as selected for the encore, and served to

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.389.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.389.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.389.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

bring out the beautiful qualities of the voice of the singing preacher in the
most pleasing manner. Again he as applauded, but the audience as obliged to
be satisfied with a bow.</p>

<p>Dr. A. Enander, editor of "Hemlandet," of Chicago, formerly editor of 
the "Swedish Journal," of Omaha, read a poem of his on composition, written
especially for the occasion. It as quite lengthy,
and dealt with patriotism and love for the adopted
country as well as for the Fatherland. The
beauties of both countries were extolled, and many

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Rev. Carl Swensson, D. D.</p>
 
</div>

beautiful ideas of a patriotic nature were expressed.</p>

<p>The Jubilee Chorus then sang "The Singers'
March," by J. A. Dahlstrom, in a very catchy,
marital Style, and as liberally applauded,</p>

<p>Rev. Carl Swensson, of Bethany College, at

Linsborg, Kansas, one of the most prominent of
Swedish-Americans, as the orator of the evening.
He spoke for nearly two hours in Swedish, complimenting the people of this vicinity in the enterprise which had brought so many of them together on
this occasion, and spoke glowingly of the land
which had given them all birth. He referred
somewhat in detail to the various portions of Sweden, and extolled the bravery
of the men and the beauty and the home qualities of the omen. The discovery
of America by Lief Erickson as referred to with pride by the speaker, and he
recalled the fact that, in the war of the Rebellion, it as another native of
Sweden, John Erickson, who invented the famous vessel which changed the
tide of battle in favor of the Union. He declared that it as the duty of every
loyal Swede to lend his assistance in the relief of the suffering in Cuba, and
administered many words of advice and patriotism. He as frequently applauded,
and at the conclusion of his address the applause
as very emphatic and continued.</p>

<p>The program concluded with a Jubilee Cantata
by Adolph Edgren, introducing solos, duets and
mixed choruses. It as well rendered and loudly
applauded.</p>

<p>MONTANA DAY—June 29, 1898</p>

<p>The location of the Montana building gave it
prominence, being on the main avenue leading
south from the esplanade, and near the entrance
to the Bluff tract from Sherman avenue. The
building was well arranged, and under the able
supervision of Mr. W. H. Sutherlin, Exposition
Vice-President for Montana. The Montana

building and exhibit, both of which reflected great credit on the State, were made
possible by the liberal donation of Mr. Marcus Daly, who pledged the delegation
that visited Montana to promote the Exposition in the inter of 1897 a donation
of fifteen thousand dollars; the legislature afterwards appropriated a like amount,
and the exhibits from that State and the building erected by the Commission were
placed in charge of Vice-President Sutherlin.</p>

<p>The exercises dedicating the building to the uses for which it had been
erected were held at four o'clock p. m., and while simple, were impressive. The
program consisted of a short address by Vice-President Sutherlin, several musical
selections, and an address by President Gurdon W. Wattles, and as concluded
by a luncheon served by the Montana Commission.</p>

<p>TURNERS' DAY AND MUSICAL CONGRESS DAY—June 30, 1898</p>

<p>For many weeks the Turners of Omaha and many other cities throughout
the West had looked forward to this celebration and the drills for prizes that
were to take place on the Exposition grounds with much interest. They gathered
early and in large numbers. The principal drill as at six o'clock in the evening
on the plaza. In this drill, about four hundred Turners participated. Other
exercises were had, and withal the day proved a great success.</p>

<p>THE MUSICAL CONGRESS</p>

<p>The principal sessions of the Musical Congress were held in the First
Congregational Church of Omaha, but the principal musical feature of the
Congress as the oratorio of "Isaiah," written and rendered by American
singers in the Auditorium building in the evening. Mr. Willard Patten, the
composer, and his Minneapolis choral organization of 250 voices, came by special
train for this rendition. The orchestral features were rendered by the entire
Theodore Thomas Orchestra, and the following soloists participated: Mrs.
Genevieve Clark Wilson, Chicago, soprano; Miss Katherine Fiske, New York,
contralto; Mr. Frederich Carberry, Chicago, tenor; Mr. Charles Clarke, Chicago,
baritone. The audience taxed the capacity of the large auditorium, and the
enthusiasm as strong and spontaneous.</p>

<p>The interest in all the meetings of the Musical Congress as great, and the
results were most satisfactory to all musicians.
Mrs. Winona S. Sayer, of the Bureau of Education, speaking of the aims
and purposes of the Bureau in arranging a musical congress in connection with
the Exposition, said, among other things:</p>

<p>"With the first month of the Exposition as a prelude to a grand symphony,
the beauty of the architecture and the arrangement of the buildings suggestive
of the allegro movement, the labor of the patience and anxiety requisite to secure
these results typical of the andante, the entertainment, amusement and pleasure
intimating the scherzo movement, we prize this Congress coming at this time.

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.391.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.391.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.391.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

It stands out like a fugue subject, with strong, marked features of lofty inspiration
and high ideals which, once introduced, will be again and again taken up and
repeated successively in various keys and various harmonies throughout the
Exposition."</p>

<p>TEXAS MELON DAY—July 1, 1898</p>

<p>The Texas Exposition Commission, supplementing their general exhibit at
the Exposition, set apart this day to show to the world the beauty and demonstrate
the good quality of their product of watermelons. Twelve hundred melons were
provided for the feast, which occurred at 5 o'clock p. m. The distribution was
made the occasion for brief ceremonies at the Horticultural building.</p>

<p>S. J. T. Johnson, Exposition Vice-President for Texas, and Superintendent
Atwater, in charge of the Texas exhibits, made short addresses, which were
responded to on behalf of the Exposition by General Manager T. S. Clarkson.
This concluded the formalities of the occasion.</p>

<p>Long tables had been provided upon which to carve and serve the luscious
fruit, and a force under the direction of Arthur Nelson, Superintendent of the
Missouri horticultural exhibit, as kept busy until the last melon had vanished
from sight. Some of the melons weighed nearly forty pounds, and it as
estimated that ten thousand persons were served during the feast.</p>

<p>NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES</p> 

<p>July 2, 1898</p>

<p>A large number of delegates <em class="hi">en route</em> to the meeting of the National Council of Congregational Churches, to be held at Portland, Oregon, stopped at Omaha to visit the Exposition, and the local society made their visit the occasion of a
special gathering and demonstration at the Boys' and Girls' building on the
Exposition grounds.</p>

<p>There were about one hundred and fifty prominent clergymen from eastern
cities, besides many of their friends and laymen, and the auditorium of the
Boys' and Girls' building as well filled when they gathered at four o'clock for
the brief exercises and exchange of formalities.</p>

<p>Reverend S. Wright Butler presided, and by his many witticisms kept the
audience in good humor. He introduced President Wattles, who extended a
hearty welcome to the distinguished guests.</p>

<p>Ex-Governor Coffin, of Connecticut, responded briefly. A vote of thanks
was then moved by Dr. Hazen to the people of Omaha, and to the Exposition
management for the generous entertainment which had been accorded. Dr.
Lamson, of Hartford, closed the speaking. The music of the day as rendered
by Mrs. G. W. Johnson, Miss Kellogg and Mrs. A. G. Edwards, all of Omaha.</p>

<p>INDEPENDENCE DAY—July 4, 1898</p>

<p>An outline of the exercises of Independence Day as given an appropriate
place in Chapter III, Part I, of this History. The oration of the day was as
follows:</p>

<p>ORATION OF HON. JAMES M. BECK, OF PHILADELPHIA</p>

<p>"AS AN EAGLE STIRRETH UP HER NEST"</p>

<p>"My Fellow-Countrymen: From the city of the Declaration of Independence,
where Henry spoke, Jefferson wrote, Franklin counseled, Adams debated, Morris
administered and Washington unsheathed his sword, within whose walls is
Germantown, and near to whose gates are Brandywine and Valley Forge, I bring
you a fraternal greeting. Philadelphia felicitates Omaha. Pennsylvania salutes
Nebraska and her sisters of the Great West. They congratulate you on this
imposing pageant of art and industry, representing the resources of a section
over which, when the great Declaration as given to the world, the banner of
Spain floated in triumph. Its marvelous growth under free institutions is a
vindication, beyond the agricultural of mere words, of those sublime truths to which
our fathers gave undying expression one hundred and tenty-two years ago today.</p>

<p>"In the contrasts of history can be often seen the divine purpose, which
runs through the ages. When La Salle, in 1682, traversed the Mississippi, and,
standing at its mouth, claimed the vast territory which it drained for his royal
master and named it in his honor, 'Louisiana,' the <em class="hi">grand monarque</em> as even then

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

constructing in the insolence of his unbridled
power, and on a scale of imperial magnificence, the
palace of Versailles. Its splashing fountains, endless chambers of crystal, flowery parterres and gorgeous frescoes proclaimed the power of the
so-called 'Sun King,' whose <em class="hi">'l'Etat c'est Moi'</em> was
the extreme of regal despotism. Later, this Trans-Mississippi region, after languishing beneath the yoke of the Spanish Bourbons, became part of
Napoleon's dream of universal empire. It is an
inspiring reflection that the hand which drafted
the Declaration of Independence rescued this vast
empire from the iron grasp of the modern Caesar
and dedicated it to free institutions forevermore.
Vanished is the power of the 'Sun King,' Spanish
Bourbons and the granite-souled Emperor. The
tyranny which created that wonderful apotheosis of personal absolutism, the
palace of Versailles, has been sept away by the dynamic force of democratic
ideas, and today in this region, once believed to be a desert, but no the home
of tenty-two millions of freemen, the people have erected these splendid palaces.
of triumphal democracy.</p>

<p>"We can reverently thank the Ruler of Nations, by whose ordinance the
Republic came into being and to serve whose wise purposes it continues to exist,
that upon no preceding anniversary has our country exercised so wide an
influence among the nations of the earth, nor used it for any loftier or nobler
purpose. The Republic is in arms today not because it loves peace less, but
because it loves justice more. Never did nation make war with a less selfish.
purpose. The American people, until patience had ceased to be a virtue, sympathized with their noble President in the wish that this cup of bitterness might
be spared our lips. No lust of military glory or territorial aggrandizement
inspired our nation. We had been slow to believe the oft-repeated stories of
medieval barbarities in Cuba, and our traditional policy as opposed to intervention in the domestic affairs of another power. A certain spirit of <em class="hi">noblesse oblige</em> restrained us from striking a weaker foe, even in a just cause. It as not until a daughter of Nebraska had died in Cuban waters, and her husband, its honored Senator, had, in a speech of great eloquence and yet greater pathos,
given us 'the true and sensible avouch of his on eyes,' that our pacific purposes
gave place to the passionate indignation of freemen, that the spirit of the
crusader sept through our veins, and the cry, 'God wills it,' as heard on every
hand. We then took a high resolve in the spirit of our fathers, that our blood
should be as dust and our treasure as water to stop this barbarity forever. We have thus disproved the libel against the American character, that our aims are
purely material, and that our unequaled growth in wealth has choked the finer
sensibilities of the soul. Let those who heard unheeded the moan of the Cretan
and the death rattle of the Armenian, and yet taunted us with the blind worship
of wealth, forever hold their peace! we have vindicated the rights of humanity
and shown that there is one nation whose conscience is not dead, and of whom it
can not be truly said that the 'age of chiva1ry' is gone and one of the calculators
and economists has succeeded. We are moved by his spirit who, a generation
ago, believed that the elemental demands of justice rose higher than mere form,
precedent or convention. Though dead, John Brown yet speaketh, and 'his soul
is marching on.' The old bell which more than a century ago rang out our
freedom, though mute to the ear of flesh, is still grandly proclaiming, even
to the islands of the sea, 'liberty throughout all the land and unto all the
inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>"As we meet this morning, we can give especial thanks for the sift and
triumphant vindication of our cause. With the proud fleet of Cervera annihilated
and Santiago doomed, the vulture of Spanish oppression lies prostrate under
the talons of the eagle. Again the great Declaration, whose basic principle is
the political equality of the individual, has been justified in the splendid manhood
and invincible bravery of our soldiers and sailors. With fear and trembling
many awaited the dawn of this day, lest our brave sons at Santiago, facing
a hidden and powerful foe under conditions of unparalleled difficulty, should

of the Republic, at whose martial prowess supercilious foreign critics sneered,
have again given immortal proof to the world that 'our flag is still there.'</p>

<p>"Our rejoicing, however, may well be tempered today by the appreciation
of the tremendous responsibilities which, by no wish or purpose of ours, are
suddenly devolved upon us. Dewey's genius and valor, not unworthy of a land
which gave Paul Jones, Greble, Bainbridge, Decatur, Porter and Farragut to
history, have blazed the path to victory, and have confronted the American
people with a responsibility more momentous and pregnant with future consequences than has ever weighed upon our nation on any natal anniversary since
the Civil War. That involved our existence: this may define our position and
relations to the rest of the world. To give back the conquered territory to Spain
may be to subject a weak and helpless people to its vindictive revenge; to give
A these various possessions in to hemispheres to their on people may be to
make them the prey for the powers of Europe, whose selfish greed for territory
is no finding expression in China; for us to surrender these conquered islands
to any other nation is to incur the enmity of the rest, and perhaps involve
civilization in a war which might rap the world in its devouring flame; and
yet, to annex them permanently to the Republic is to cross a greater Rubicon
than that at whose brink even Caesar halted, and with consequences scarcely 
less momentous. Jefferson's words to James Monroe, which inspired the Monroe
Doctrine, may well be recalled as applicable to the present crisis in our national
life. 'The question,' he said, 'is the most momentous which has ever been offered
to my contemplation since that of independence; that made us a nation, this
sets our compass and points the course which we are to steer through the ocean
of time opening on us.'</p>

<p>"Is the Western hemisphere large enough for the influence and progress of
the American people, or must we surrender, commercially and politically, our
policy of isolation and claim an influence which shall be as limitless as the world
is round? The Atlantic coast as our cradle; lusty youth found us on the banks
we of the Mississippi; vigorous maturity has brought us to the Pacific. What of
that momentous morrow, the twentieth century? Are we, like Alexander, to
stop at the margin of the sea and mourn that it forever bars our further progress,
or are we, like the inspired pilot of Genoa, to launch the bark of our national
destiny into an unknown sea in search of new and untried routes to national
prosperity?</p>

<p>"Well may we, my fellow-countrymen, in this great crisis of our national
life, remember the beginning of the Republic and the teachings of our fathers.
Such remembrance is not merely a grateful tribute to the dead, but will help us
discharge our duty to the unborn. Let us, then, in the spirit of the great lawgiver
and leader of an oppressed people:</p>

<p>"'Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations.'</p>

<p>"'As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth
abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings.</p>

<p>"'So the Lord alone did lead him, and there as no strange god with him.'</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.395.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.395.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.395.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"This very striking metaphor of Moses suggests a great truth in connection
with our development as a nation, that it has never been permitted to remain long
within the nest of any traditional policy. There is a natural conservatism in the
Anglo-Saxon race, and a distrust and dread of innovation. It has ever been
slow to leave the beaten paths of the fathers. Nor need this be deprecated, for
it insures a reasonable continuity of policy. Every great step forward has been
due, not to the leadership of our great men, nor to any conscious and deliberate
purpose of the people, but holly to a divine guidance which, working through
the force of unforeseen circumstances and a certain unconscious intuitive impulse
of the masses, has destroyed the nest of tradition and thrust us as young eagles
into the void. The great actors of the revolutionary epoch had their traditions,
and an ancestry in which they gloried, and yet, were forced by the logic of
events to disregard them both. Their traditional policy as loyalty to the king,
hatred of France, with whom they had contested for the possession of North
America, pride in the English
Empire, and disinclination
towards any union between 
themselves. When the Revolution broke out, nothing was
further from their purpose
than separation from England,
Said John Adams: 'There
was not a moment during the
Revolution when I would not

<p>Machinery and Electricity Building</p>
 
</div> 

have given everything I possessed for a restoration to the
state of things before the contest" began, provided we could have had a sufficient
security for its continuance.' Dr. Franklin, the most trusted, sagacious and farseeing statesman of his generation, said before the battle of Lexington that he
had not heard the 'least expression of a wish for separation, or a hint that such a
thing would be advantageous to America.' Mr. Jay said: 'During the course of
my life, and until the second petition of Congress in 1775, I never had heard an
American of any. class or of any description express a wish for the independence
of the Colonies} The author of the Declaration of Independence said: 'It has
always been, and still is, my opinion and belief that our country as prompted
and impelled to independence by necessity, not by choice. I never heard a whisper,
before the commencement of hostilities, of a disposition to separate from Great
Britain} Washington, in 1774, denounced as 'malevolent falsehoods' the assertions that 'there is any intention in the American Colonies to set up for independent
States} In 1776, he rote: 'when I took command of the army I abhorred the
idea of independence; no I am convinced nothing else will save us.'</p>

<p>"'Building better than we knew as all master builders of a nation—our
fathers were led, by impulses which they could not appreciate or understand, to

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.396.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.396.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.396.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

disregard every tradition which they held dear, to renounce allegiance to the
King, separate from the great English Empire, make formal alliance with their
hated enemy, France, and create a union of which each had been but too jealous.</p>

<p>"The Constitution of the United States as not the deliberate wish of the
people, but as created by their necessities; it met no one's entire approval, as
only adopted after bitter debates of four months' duration, and as the result of
a compromise begotten by the stern and pressing necessities of the situation.
Only a choice between chaos and a constitution induced the jarring, discordant
and jealous States to surrender any portion of their sovereignty, and yet this
Constitution in its present form, the child of no brain and the creation of no wish,
is the admiration of the world, and has been pronounced by the noblest and most
scholarly statesman of our time, whose death we even no mourn, to have been
the most perfect ever struck off by the brain and purpose of man at a given time.</p>

<p>"Nor has this truth been less marked in our on time and generation. The
Emancipation Proclamation clearly violated the traditional policy of our country,
which recognized the existence of slavery. Jefferson's stern denunciation of the
slave trade, which he had inserted in the first draft of the great Declaration,
was stricken out by Congress, and the Constitution itself distinctly recognized
the existence of this baleful domestic institution. Its destruction was not due
to the conscious and deliberate purpose of any statesman. Lincoln, at the beginning
of his administration, distinctly disclaimed any purpose to interfere with it, and
it was not until the blood, which had been shed from Bull Run to Antietam,
cried as from the ground, that again the nest of tradition as destroyed and
the eagle essayed a new and nobler flight. No one recognized this more clearly
than did the great war President, and in his second inaugural he plainly voiced
his belief that not only the removal of slavery but the Civil war itself had come 
by no human wisdom, but by a divine judgment.</p>

<p>"The same momentous fact is true today., Once again the nation feels a
mysterious and puissant impulse. It has ever been the traditional policy of the
Republic not to interfere in the domestic affairs of a friendly power, and the
Monroe Doctrine distinctly disclaimed any intention to interfere with existing
colonial dependencies in America of European powers; but as Lexington inflamed
a continent and created a new nation, as Fort Sumter rudely shattered our dream
of peace and compelled us to remove by the sword the running sore of slavery, the
explosion of the Maine and the cruelties to the Cuban people have compelled us
to discard our traditional and valued policy of non-interference, and directly
interfere with the domestic affairs of another nation.</p>

<p>We need not regret the transitory influence of the past. Blind adherence to
tradition is not the highest patriotism, but is a form of intellectual slavery not
worthy of a free and progressive people. An assumption that the teaching of our
fathers expressed th we finality of political wisdom is contradicted by the uniform
"experience of mankind. I yield to no one in my reverential respect for the
founders of this Republic. No Government has had greater men, and history can
be searched in vain for any loftier lives or wiser minds than Washington and

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.397.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.397.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.397.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Franklin, Jefferson and Hamilton, Madison and Monroe. The eloquent judgment
of the elder Chatham has received the considerate approval of mankind, when,
speaking of the first Continental Congress, he said, 'I must declare and avow
that in all my reading and study—and I have read Thucydides and have studied
and admired the master States of the world—that for solidity of reason, force of
sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion, under such a complication of circumstances.
no nation or body of men can stand in preference to the General Congress at
Philadelphia.' Nevertheless, the Almighty never intended that wisdom should
die either with one man, one generation, one race, one century, or one epoch.
Least of any people should America doubt the 'increasing purpose' of the ages
and the widening of thought 'with the process of the suns.'</p>

<p>"Because our fathers thought that the stage coach as adequate to their
needs, shall we abandon the locomotive? The old wooden battleships, such as the
'Bon Homme Richard' and the 'Constitution,' on imperishable laurels for the
American navy, but shall we therefore place these obsolete sailing vessels in
conflict with modern steel battleships? Because the Continentals defended Bunker
Hill and achieved the crowning triumph of Yorktown with flint-lock muskets,
shall we discard the repeating rifle? If Franklin impressed his personality
upon the world with a hand-press, shall we less avail ourselves of those throbbing
engines which make possible the modern newspaper? Our fathers recognized
that wise nations, as wise individuals, change their minds when occasion justifies,
but fools never. Let us not ascribe to them an infallibility which they do not
claim for themselves. Democracy acknowledges no living sovereign, much less
those who are said to 'rule us from their urns.' The decadence of Spain, which
has cost her the empire of the world, and no brought her to the verge of final
ruin, is due to her 'inordinate tenacity of old opinions, old beliefs, and old habits,
which Buckle finds to be her predominant national characteristic. He adds: 'By
encouraging the notion that all the truths most important to know are already
known, they repress those aspirations and dull that generous confidence in the
future without which nothing really great can be achieved. A people who regard
the past with too wistful an eye will never bestir themselves to help the onward
progress. To them antiquity is wisdom, and every improvement is a dangerous
innovation} The nation which has most consistently and continuously followed
the worship of ancestry is China, and as a result it is today the helpless prey of
other powers, although in number and resources it is potentially the most powerful
on the earth.</p>

<p>We must not as a people permit the past to fetter the present. That way
retrogression lies, and our duty as a nation is to be determined by present, not by
past, conditions. We can not even stand still. We must move onward. From
civilization we derive inestimable rights, to her we owe immeasurable duties, and
to shirk these is cowardice and moral death. No nation can live to itself, even if
it would. The economic developments of the nineteenth century have produced a
solidarity of humanity, which no racial prejudice or international hatred can
destroy. Each nation is its brother's keeper, and the greater the power, the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.398.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.398.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.398.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

greater the responsibility. If this be so, no nation owes a greater duty to civilization to be potential in the councils of the world than the United States. For it
to skulk and shirk behind the selfish policy of isolation and to abdicate a destined
world supremacy, would be the colossal crime of history. God has given us the
power—woe be unto us if we do not use it! The stern but just law, which has
governed the nations in all history, is that he alone shall have, who uses. Its
ethical sanction is found in that parable of the talents, in which the Great Teacher
laid down the moral law that no man or nation has an indefeasible title to property,
that all is holden of God, and tenure depends upon rightful use. From Spain, as
from an unprofitable and slothful servant, are about to be taken colonies which
she has failed to develop in harmony with modern progress. Let our people,
instead of questioning the law, remember that we too shall perish when we cease
to develop the talents committed to our charge. Of every rotten tree the eternal
inquiry of the Great Woodman is heard, 'Why cumbereth it the ground?'</p>

<p>"In discussing any question, therefore, which may result from the present
war with Spain, let us not give undue or conclusive value to the opinions of the
past. The conditions under which we must act are essentially different from
those which existed in our father's time, and the Poet of Democracy said nothing
more worthy of remembrance by us as a people than that—</p>

<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">"New occasions teach new duties; time makes ancient good uncouth;</span>
<span class="l">They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast of truth.</span></span>

<p>"Steam and electricity have destroyed our 'distant and detached position,'
of which Washington spoke in the immortal Farewell Address, and upon which
he predicated in the infancy of the Republic a policy of isolation. Then we were
the weakest power in the world; today we are the strongest. Then we were
three millions in number, scattered over three hundred thousand square miles of
territory; today we are seventy-five millions of people, inhabiting a continent
from ocean to ocean, fronting the Orient and the Occident and possessed of
resources which are inexhaustible. Then we were almost exclusively an agricultural country; today we are the greatest agricultural, mining, and manufacturing
nation of the globe, and second only to England in commercial prestige. Then it
required five weeks to visit or communicate with Europe, and the Atlantic Ocean
seemed a natural barrier; today we can Hash a message around the world in a
few hours, and can learn of its affairs almost as they occur. The citizens of
New York can today reach London with more facility than the first President
could leave Mount Vernon and proceed to Philadelphia. when, therefore,
Washington, at a time when the great European powers had been thrown by the
French Revolution into a state of chaos, advised the infant Republic, newest
among nations and weakest in credit, numbers and resources, to avoid any
interference in the affairs of the greater world beyond the seas, lest as a lamb
it should be devoured by a pack of wolves, he counseled, as he always did, with
wisdom unimpeachable; but those who would forever keep the Republic in her

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.399.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.399.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.399.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

swaddling clothes, and who for this purpose invoke the great name of Washington, should first convince us that if he were the President of the most powerful
nation in the world he would advise it to yield precedence to lesser and weaker
powers. Would he not feel that this Colossus among nations should not lisp in
the language of its infancy, but should say with St. Paul, 'When as a child I
spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became
a man I put away childish things.'</p>

<p>"Our nation is today feeling that instinct of expansion which is the predominant characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race. It is bred in our bone and
courses with our lifeblood, and the statesmen of our day must take it into account
and endeavor to control it wisely. There is with us, as with our great mother
empire, a national instinct for territorial growth, 'so powerful and accurate, that
statesmen of every school, willing or unwilling, have found themselves carried
along by a tendency which no individuality can resist or greatly modify.' We
could as hopefully bid the Mississippi cease its flow towards the sea, or the
Missouri remain chained within its rocky sources, as to prevent the onward
movement of this great, proud, generous, and aggressive people. This as true
of the day of our weakness, it is true in this the day of our strength.</p>

<p>"The first effort of the newly recognized Republic as to acquire territory.
when at the close of the Revolution, our Peace Commissioners met in Paris, the
problem arose as to the true boundaries of the new nation. We had solemnly
covenanted with France that we should not sign any treaty of peace with
England unless our ally concurred. France insisted that the vast area between
the rivers which flowed into the Atlantic and the Mississippi as Spanish
territory. Our Commissioners felt that our national destiny justified a claim to
the east bank of the Mississippi, and they so far 'stooped to conquer' as to
secretly execute, without the knowledge or concurrence of France, a treaty with
England which gave us the territory to the Father of waters. Congress at first
was disposed to condemn this act of the Commission and disclaim the territory
beyond the Alleghenies, which were felt by many to be the boundaries which
nature had set to the advance of the Republic. The most radical agreed that the
Mississippi as our true boundary, and yet the commercial necessity of its free
navigation caused our fathers, a few years later, to reverse this narrow conception
of their national destiny, and constrained as sincere and lofty a statesman as I
Jefferson to sacrifice his cherished theories as to the constitutional powers of the
Federal Government by purchasing on his on responsibility, and without the
authority of either the Constitution or of Congress, this great empire between the
Mississippi and the Pacific. A great party vainly opposed the purchase of this
region, and in so doing, destroyed only itself. Speaking in one of its thirty great
opulent cities, at an Exposition which represents the resources of twenty-two
million of freemen, let me quote the words of Senator white spoken on the floor
of the Senate in 1803. He said: 'But as to Louisiana, this new, immense,
unbounded world, if it should ever be incorporated into this Union, which I have
no idea can be done but by altering the Constitution, I believe it will be the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.400.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.400.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.400.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

greatest curse that could at present befall us. It may be productive of innumerable evils, and especially one that I even fear to look upon.' And then he added,
'Gentlemen on all sides, with very few exceptions, agree that the settlement of this
country will be highly injurious and dangerous to the United States. * * *
We have already territory enough, and when I contemplate the evils that may
arise to these States from this incorporation of Louisiana into the Union, I would
rather see it given to France, to Spain, or to any other nation of the earth, upon
the mere condition that no citizen of the United States should ever settle within
its limits, than to see the territory sold for one hundred million dollars, and we
retain the sovereignty.'</p>

<p>"The opposition to the acquisition of Louisiana as repeated in the matter of
disputed territory of Oregon, which an influential Senator said as 'not worth
a pinch of snuff,' and but for Whitman's perilous journey across the continent,
would have been forever lost to the Union; but the impulse of our people towards
expansion triumphed in the
matter of Louisiana and Oregon, as also in that of Texas,
California and Alaska, and
today our territorial possessions stretch so far into the
Pacific, that the sun which
casts its last rays upon the
farthest Aleutian Island is 
already illuminating the rocky 
coast of Maine. San Francisco, once our Western limit, 

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Fine Arts Building</p>
 
</div>

is now but midway between our eastern and Western possessions, and the shores
of Puget Sound, originally our most northern frontier, are no more than a
thousand miles south of that final shore, which stretches toward the Pole and into
the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>"I would not be understood as arguing in favor of the annexation of any of
the islands, of which we have taken possession for the purposes of the war, or
indeed of any policy of indiscriminate territorial acquisition. These are questions
about which men of equal intelligence and patriotism may reasonably differ, and
both the limitations and the proprieties of the occasion forbid their discussion.
have been protesting, however, against the tyranny of tradition, intellectual
slavery, which compels obedience to past ideals, and the assumption that there
should be any policy which forbids the further expansion of the Republic.</p>

<p>"Let us equally beware of the fatal error of empires and republics, that a
nation is necessarily great in proportion to its area and population. To no
principle of public policy has history given a more uniform and emphatic contradiction. As Mr. Lowell has beautifully said, 'The greatness of a nation is
weighed in scales more delicate than the balance of trade. On the maps you can
cover Athens with a pin point and Judea with a finger tip, and yet in those

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.401.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.401.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.401.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

magnificent places impulses have been given which have not ceased to direct
civilization.' If mere numbers and area determine greatness, China would be the
greatest nation in the world, and yet greater than all Cathay as that little capital
of Attica, Athens, which has flamed as a torch of culture over the ages, and lives
in memory as the 'city of the violet crown.' Expansion is not necessarily strength,
but may involve weakness, and we should not add to our already onerous
responsibilities, without undoubted compensatory advantages, or unless our duty
to humanity clearly requires us to take weaker nations under our fostering
influence.</p>

<p>"There is one tradition of our fathers, which we can not too strictly respect,
and whose value time can not 'wither nor custom stale.' It is the spirit of justice,
to which, by that instrument whose adoption we celebrate today, our country is
solemnly dedicated forevermore. The richest country in the world, though it
were paved with gold, were dear enough, if purchased at the price of this ideal.
In achieving its high destiny, the Republic must therefore respect the noble and
cosmopolitan spirit in which it as formed. To appreciate it we must comprehend
the meaning and purpose of the declaration. It is commonly believed that it is
noteworthy in our annals, because by that instrument, and on the day on which
it as proclaimed, our country severed its relations with Great Britain. This is a
mistake. The formal act of severance from Great Britain did not occur on the
Fourth of July, nor by the Declaration. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee,
of Virginia, at the instance of Virginia, introduced his three famous resolutions,
the first of which as, 'That these United Colonies are, and of right ought
to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to
the British agricultural, and that the political connection between them and the State
of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally absolved.' They were debated with
great earnestness on the eighth and tenth of June, by which time it became clear
a majority of the colonies as prepared to adopt them, but for the sake of greater
unanimity, the consideration of the question as postponed until July 1st, and
the committee, composed of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin,
Roger Sherman and Robert R. Livingston, as appointed to prepare a formal
declaration to the world. On the first day of July, Congress, sitting as a committee of the hole, resumed consideration of the question and it as passed by
the committee. On the following day, July 2, 1776, Rodney, having 'come post
from the Delaware Counties,' and Pennsylvania having changed her vote, the
House unanimously adopted the original resolution. If, therefore, the commencement of the Republic is to date from the formal resolution of severance,
rather than from the real severance, which commenced with the first Continental
Congress, then on July 2, 1776, the United States began their separate and 
independent existence. This as clearly the belief of those who participated in
the proceedings, and as expressed by John Adams in his memorable letter of
July 3, 1776, to his wife, when he said, 'But the day is past. The second day of
July, 1776, will be a memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to
believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.402.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.402.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.402.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts
of devotion to God Almighty. * * * You may think me transported with
enthusiasm, but I am not; I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure
that it will cost us to maintain this declaration and support and defend these
States. yet through all the gloom I can see the rays of light and glory.'</p>

<p>"What, then, as the purpose of the great Declaration, and what has given
it not only undying significance for all future time, but especial value for us today?
It as this: Our fathers appreciated that their act as essentially revolutionary,
that it had no sanction in any code of municipal or international law, and that its
only justification must be found in that higher law of the human conscience by
which in the last analysis all political acts must be judged. They therefore felt
that their action required formal justification, and it as for the purpose of satisfying the conscience of mankind as to the justice of an act essentially revolutionary that the Declaration of Independence as adopted on July 4, 1776. It
as not, therefore, intended for the colonists. For them a recital of their grievances as superfluous, for the wrongs done them were ineffaceably seared into
their memories. Nor as the Declaration an appeal to public sentiment in England, for their 'humble petition' of 1776 had been contemptuously spurned both
by the King and his subservient Parliament.</p>

<p>"Our fathers felt that further discussion with England as useless. Its
purpose as, therefore, solemnly to challenge the justice of the world to the necessity of the separation. This is clearly shown by its noble preamble: 'When, in the
course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political
bands which have connected them with another * * * a decent respect to the opinion of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to
the separation.' This paper, therefore, assumes—vainly as it then seemed, in an age
in which might as supposed to make. right—that there as a law of right and
wrong, which, rising higher than las, precedence, or conventions, regulated the
intercourse of nations as individuals. It believed in moral responsibility, for
nations as for men, and it evolved a belief in a great human conscience, which,
towering above the selfish interest of nations and races, would approve the right
and condemn the wrong. It assumed that this approval as more to be desired
than nation advantage. It established civilization as a judge between contending
nations, with posterity as a court of last resort. It proclaimed the solidarity of
humanity, and placed it higher than the tie of nationality. It argued—not with the
ethics of a rifle or the morality of the cannon only, but with the power of the
untrammeled reason-the righteousness of the separation at the bar of history. It a
satisfied the reason of man by adding 'In proof of this let facts be submitted to a
candid world.' Nay, it recognized that even above the conscience of mankind,
there as the 'Ruler of Nations,' by whom all acts would be finally and infallibly
judged, and therefore the great Declaration concluded by solemnly 'appealing to
the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions.'</p>

<p>"Such as the spirit, such the purpose, such the crowning glory of the
noblest State paper ever drafted by the hand of man or proclaimed by any people.

It proclaimed a new principle in the history of human affairs, that not by armies
and navies alone, nor by the power of economic resources, but by the standards
of eternal justice, should a nation in the fear of God determine its action. In like
spirit as the parting precept of the Father of his Country, 'the counsel of an old
and affectionate friend,' voiced in that immortal farewell message, which as his
benediction to the people whom he loved so well:</p>

<p>"'Observe good faith and justice towards all nations. Cultivate peace and
harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be that
good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worth·y of a free, enlightened,
and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and
too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence.'"</p>

<p>"With this spirit we need not fear to face the future. No problem to confront us will prove too great for our solution, and no work too great for our
achievement. Faintly to grasp the future of this country is to bewilder and exhaust
the imagination. That past is but the 'happy prologue to the selling act of an
imperial theme.' Today as never before we face the world as a united country. If
wounds there have been, they are healed; if cause for quarrel, it has gone. East and
West, from the Father of waters, north and south of Mason and Dixon's line, we
are one today, my fellow men; one in the proud possession of the glorious past, one
in a resolute purpose to meet the duties of the hour, and one in an abiding faith in
the future of our beloved country. Never before did her flag float as a symbol of
possession over so vast a dominion. Not only from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf,
and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but in those islands of the sea here the
Caribbean breaks, and in that farther archipelago, laved by the China Sea, the
Star-Spangled Banner floats today in proudest triumph. Our boast is that of the
mother empire, of whose teeming womb we are born, that night no longer falls
upon our possessions, for when these joyous festivities shall have ended and day
shall fade from yonder lagoon, and when the moon shall silver with its mellow
glory these noble temples of art and industry, the sun will be flooding the harbor
of Manila, and illuminating that glorious flag under which Dewey and his heroes
defended this country's honor. For one land, one people, one flag, and one
destiny, let us reverently thank the God of our Fathers. May the glory of the
Republic be as lasting as the day which shines upon her flag, and her beneficent
influence upon future generations as ceaseless as the majestic flow of the Mississippi to the sea!"</p>

<p>A MASSACHUSETTS DAY—July 11, 1898</p>

<p>The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts having provided for a formal
representation at the Exposition, the State officials selected this day for their
visit. At the head of the delegation as Lieut-Gov. Murray Crane and staff.
Besides the Governor, most of the State officers and numerous members of the
Assembly were present. The exercises were held in the Auditorium at eleven

o'clock a. m. Governor Holcomb and staff and State Adjutant-General Barry,
Chancellor George E. McLean of the University of Nebraska, Manager Edward
Rosewater, and other Nebraskans assisted in the entertainment of the distinguished guests. Mrs. Clement Chase, Chairman of the Bureau of Entertainment,
and other members of that Bureau were present. After music, Governor Hale as
introduced and heartily welcomed the visitors from the old Bay State.</p>

<p>Lieut. Gov. W. Murray Crane responded in a brief but appropriate address.
President Gurdon W. Wattles delivered an address of welcome in which he
referred to the fact that at one time the boundaries of Massachusetts extended
westward to the Western line of the dominion of the nation, and said that although
these boundaries no longer reached to eastern bounds of our State, yet the
influence of the New England stock from which many of the residents of the West
descended, and the ties of consanguinity which bound the West to the East made
the representatives of Massachusetts as welcome as though we were a part of the
old Bay State itself.</p>

<p>Hon. George we. Smith, President of the Senate of Massachusetts, delivered
a most polished address, after which Mrs. G. W. Johnston sang in a most pleasing
manner and as warmly applauded.</p>

<p>Hon. John L. Bates, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Massachusetts Legislature, as the next speaker. He said that the delegates from
Massachusetts brought the hearty good-will of the people of that State and
congratulations on the great Exposition and on the boundless possibilities of the
great country represented by that enterprise.</p>

<p>Chancellor George E. McLean, of the Nebraska University, then delivered
an address, after which more music as rendered, and the meeting as adjourned
to luncheon served in the Markel Café. At this luncheon eloquent toasts were
responded to by H. Alexander and W. G. Whitmore, natives of Massachusetts
residing in Nebraska.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, January 12, the Massachusetts delegation as tendered a reception by President Wattles and Mrs. Wattles at their home on
Thirty-seventh street. The wide porch and grounds about their residence were
A decorated and illuminated for the occasion. Many of the prominent society people
of Omaha met the Massachusetts visitors, and the function as pronounced one
of the most elaborate and successful of any of the many private receptions given
during the entire Exposition.</p>

<p>CHILDREN'S DAY—July 14, 1898</p>

<p>Children celebrated the dedication of the Boys' and Girls' building. Early
in the construction period of the Exposition, the school children of Nebraska and Iowa decided to raise by small donations the money for a Boys' and Girls' building, to be erected on the Exposition grounds. This building as located in
the northeast corner of the Grand Court, and though not as large as the other
buildings on this court, it as well adapted for the uses for which it as

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.405.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.405.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.405.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

erected, the entertainment of the children. The building as a source of great
interest to the thousands of school children who had contributed their dimes
toward its cost, and as the admission on this dedication day had been reduced
to fifteen cents for children, great throngs of little folks were gathered early to participate in the celebration and vie the sights of the Exposition.
The exercises in the building were simple, consisting of a few short speeches
and some music, closing with the singing of the Star Spangled Banner, after
which all formalities were laid aside and the little ones enjoyed themselves in all parts of the Exposition grounds. The day closed with the usual concert in the evening, which as largely attended.</p>

<p>MILITARY DAY—July 16, 1898</p>

<p>The Third Regiment of Nebraska had been recruited by Colonel Wm. J.
Bryan and were about to leave the State for service in the Cuban war. They
were in camp at old Fort Omaha and had accepted the invitation of the Exposition officials to attend the Exposition in a body before leaving the State. Great preparations for their comfort had been made by the Woman's Bureau of Entertainment and many assistants had volunteered to serve in distributing the refreshments to the fifteen hundred soldiers who were expected to participate in the demonstration. At ten o'clock a. m., the regiment entered the Exposition grounds at the north gate and were received by General Manager Clarkson, with the Pawnee City Band, and marched down the West Midway over the north viaduct into the Grand Plaza and from there to the Nebraska building, and then countermarched back to the Plaza and over the viaduct to the Grand Court.</p>

<p>Governor Holcomb and staff on horseback, with Colonel Bryan and his
aides, preceded the marching troopers, and their bright uniforms contrasting with the beautiful white of the buildings made a scene long to be remembered by those who witnessed it. Many fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, wives and sweethearts of these volunteers were gathered on the grounds to see and perhaps embrace their loved ones for the last time. Many bands of music and waving flags lent enchantment to the scene. At eleven o'clock the troopers gathered in the Auditorium, and with their friends and visitors completely filled the great building. The public was excluded until the soldiers were seated, and there as not sufficient room for all who sought admittance.</p>

<p>On the stage were seated Governor Holcomb of Nebraska, Governor Leedy
of Kansas, Colonel William Bryan, General Barry, Adjutant-General of
Nebraska, General. Manager T. H. Clarkson, President Wattles and numerous
other Exposition officials. After several selections by the Pawnee City Band,
President Wattles introduced General Manager Clarkson, who delivered an
address of welcome to the soldiers. He bade them godspeed in the performance
of their patriotic duties. He paid eloquent tribute to the men who risked their
lives for their country's honor. His address was often interrupted by cheers and at its close the Third Regiment Band increased the enthusiasm by playing "The Battle Cry of Freedom."</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.406.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.406.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.406.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>Governor J. W. Leedy, of Kansas, then spoke briefly, after which there was
more music and then Hon. G. M. Hitchcock was introduced and presented the
regiment with a set of silk guidons, two for each of the three battalions. These were received by Colonel Bryan, who expressed feelingly the thanks of his
regiment for this and other manifestations of good-will which had been showered
upon them on every hand. At the close of his address there as more music by
the band, after which, Governor Holcomb as introduced and delivered the
formal farewell of the State to its volunteers. His address brought tears to many eyes as he assured the boys that after they had gone to the front they would be remembered and honored and their achievements would be the pride of the great commonwealth. At the close of Governor Holcomb's address, it was
announced that the Woman's Bureau of Entertainment would serve dinner to the
soldiers in their seats in the Auditorium; The women who had volunteered to

<p>MINNESOTA DEDICATION DAY—July 20, 1898</p>

<p>The Minnesota building, erected by private subscriptions and donations by
the citizens of Minnesota, as unique and unlike any other building on the 
Exposition grounds. It as typical of life in the pine forests of the State it represented, being constructed entirely of pine logs, when and mortised in an artistic
and substantial manner. The building as seventy feet long, sixty feet wide and
to stories high. There were to balconies, one at each story, tenty feet wide,
with railings made of poles surrounding them. All the materials used in the
construction were shipped from Minnesota and illustrated products of that State.
The rooms were commodious and filled with easy chairs; the walls decorated with
many pictures and heads of animals of the early pioneer life of the State.</p>

</div>

<p>Many distinguished residents of Minnesota
came on the to special trains to celebrate the
dedication of Minnesota's building and to see the
Exposition. Governor Clough and staff, the members of the Minnesota Commission, several of the State officers, and members of the Legislature, were among the visitors. The dedication exercises were held at the building at 10:30 a. m. J. Newton
Ninde, chairman of the Building Committee, presiding, who first introduced Governor Silas A. Holcomb of Nebraska, who welcomed the Governor of Minnesota and other distinguished guests. John L. Gibbs, president of the Minnesota Commission, and Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota, responded in a happy manner, after which Governor 
Clough as introduced and formally accepted the building and in turn delivered it to the Exposition officials. President Wattles of the Exposition accepted it for the management, and after his address and music by the band, Honorable W. H. Eustis, of Minnesota, delivered the closing address. The exercises closed with more music.</p>

<p>A public reception in the parlors of the Minnesota building as tendered
Governor Clough and his party after the exercises of the day.</p>

<p>INDIAN DAY—August 4, 1898</p>

<p>Early in the history of the Exposition it as proposed by President Wattles
I that an Indian Congress of the principal tribes of North American Indians should be one of the distinctive features of the Exposition. That as all of the Trans-Mississippi territory had, but a comparatively few years past, been occupied by these Indian tribes, and that as they were fast disappearing and their modes of life and customs were gradually changing with the onward march of civilization, it would, perhaps, be the last time that the primitive life of these tribes could

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.408.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.408.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.408.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

ever be successfully illustrated. As many eastern people had never seen Indians
in their semi-savage state, it as argued that this Indian Congress would be a
great drawing feature that would bring many eastern people to visit the Exposition.</p>

<p>A bill as introduced in Congress authorizing the assemblage of these Indian
tribes, and providing an appropriation of forty thousand dollars to defray the
expenses. Much delay as experienced in the passage of this measure, and finally
Manager Rosewater as prevailed upon to go to Washington and lend his efforts
to those of Congressman Mercer and Senators Allen and Thurston in securing
the desired legislation. When the bill as finally passed it as too late to assemble the Indians for the opening of the Exposition, and before the encampment as complete on the Exposition grounds, the first of August had passed. On the day set for the grand parade of Indian tribes which should mark the opening of the Indian Congress, there as encamped on the north tract of the Exposition grounds a goodly number of the following tribes:</p>

<p>Chippeas, Rosebud, Lower Brule, Cheyennes, Sissetons, Flandreau, Standing Rock, Crow, Creek, Sioux, Sacs, Foxes, Assiniboines, Omahas, Winnebagos, 
Blackfeet, Arapahoes, Jicarilla, Apaches, Nez Perces, Comanches, Wichitas, Bannocks, Pueblos, Osages, Iroquois and Poncas. The Indians were in charge of
Captain Mercer. The morning was spent in arranging their camps and in raising
the flag, which as accompanied with much ceremony and wild cheering. In the
afternoon the parade was formed and marched through the midway over the
north viaduct and down the Bluff Tract to the Horticultural building, countermarching back to the Grand Plaza. Several bands formed a part of the parade, and the Indians were dressed in the fantastic manner of their respective tribes. After the parade and a short rest, the afternoon as spent in weird dances, horse racing and other Indian amusements. The day as a great success in point of attendance, and from this the opening day of the Indian Congress, until the close of the Exposition, the Indians proved a great attraction.</p>

<p>FLOWER DAY—August 5, 1898</p>

<p>For several weeks preparations had been going on for a grand flower parade
on the Exposition grounds. This parade as one of the decidedly successful
features of the Exposition period. The omen of the Bureau of Entertainment,
under the supervision and direction of Mrs. H. McCall Travis, assumed full
charge of the decoration of vehicles that were to take part in the parade. The
pageant formed in the afternoon at the Horticultural building. Those participating with the decorations are given below:</p>

<p>OMAHA WORLD-HERALD AND NEBRASKA EDITORS' DAY</p>
<p>August 24, 1898</p>

<span class="l">The Omaha <em class="hi">World-Herald</em> had requested and been granted a special day
in which to celebrate the achievements of this progressive daily newspaper. The
occasion of the celebration as the thirteenth anniversary of the founding of the <em class="hi">Evening World</em>, which gre to be the  <em class="hi">World-Herald</em>. The day as the same
as that set aside as Nebraska Editors' Day, and the to celebrations were therefore merged. The entertainment consisted of a luncheon served at the Markel Café at the expense of the editor of the '<em class="hi">World-Herald</em>. G. M. Hitchcock, proprietor of that paper, presided. After luncheon the speech-making as started by Mr. Hitchcock, who spoke of the many pleasures the Exposition afforded his friends, and of the numerous trials and great effort by which this grand spectacle had been made possible. He then introduced President Wattles, who spoke briefly of the history and progress of the Exposition, and in closing referred to the grand Peace jubilee which had been planned for the month of October. He referred to the fact that Captain Jones of the 22d Infantry as present, carrying a Spanish bullet in his leg. His reference to Captain Jones as the occasion of great cheering, which called for a short acknowledgment from the Captain. Dr. George L. Miller, founder of the <em class="hi">Omaha Herald</em>, responded to the toast "Seed Time and Harvest of Newspaperdom." He spoke in his usual felicitous manner, and elicited much laughter and applause.</span>

<span class="l">W. S. Burr, of the <em class="hi">Aurora Register</em>, responded to the toast, "Nebraska: She Leads Them All." He spoke, in part, as follows:</span>

<p>"In some respects I am unfitted by nature to make response to the toast
proposed, being of an argumentative disposition and accustomed to reach
conclusions only by exhaustive and exhausting discussion. A question with only

one side to it, and no end at all, is a very difficult one for me to handle. when a boy, I remember reflecting on the awful consequences of a supposed encounter between an irresistible force and an immovable body, but they are likely to prove mild in comparison with the result when an interminable talker comes into perihelion with an inexhaustible subject.</p>

<p>"That Nebraska leads them all is a self-evident proposition. "Who would
produce statistics to demonstrate that the sun shines or the wind blows?
(Especially would it resemble the carrying of coals to Newcastle to attempt
to prove by figures or diagrams that the agricultural blows in Nebraska.) The people of this State have acquired a reputation of being a little extravagant and given to exaggeration when speaking of its advantages. I shall, therefore, weigh well my words and be ultra-conservative in every statement made, preferring only the modest claim that Nebraska has the richest soil, the purest air, the best Water, and as manly men and womanly women as can be found on this earth.</p>

<p>"One has but to breathe the lifeless air of the lower altitudes; note the
stunted products of the red and yellow putty called farm land throughout the
East and South; attempt to swallow the lukewarm solution of clay which hundreds
of thousands of good people must use as a beverage, to be keenly sensible of
some of the everyday, yet priceless blessings in which Nebraska leads them all.
No person who has sweltered through the long night and until four o'clock
in the morning for a refreshing breath, or who has felt the touch of malaria in his system, would be willing to exchange our climate for all the big red apples of the universe.</p>

<p>"I am of the West, Western. I have lived here for more than a quarter
century, and have passed from boyhood to manhood in a homestead country.
I can remember breaking sod day after day when the highest object in sight as
the ears of my taller horse.</p>

<p>"I have witnessed the development of our State from a barren, treeless plain
to one of the most fertile and beautiful countries ever sung by poets or prosed
over by historians. The labor of one generation of men has effected this transformation, and next to the welfare of my family I have no stronger wish than to see Nebraska owned free and clear of encumbrance by the people who have sacrificed so much to make it what it is.</p>

<span class="lg poem"><span class="l">"Long ago in the days of 'hoppers,'</span>
<span class="l">When real estate agents dealt in whoppers.</span>
<span class="l">House of sod with roof poles limber,</span>
<span class="l">Buffalo grass and cottonwood timber; </span>
<span class="l">People poor-with hearts of pity,</span>
<span class="l">Each incipient ton a city;</span>
<span class="l">Hedgerows broke, but roads across 'em,</span>
<span class="l">Folks that let nobody boss 'em;</span>
<span class="l">That's the West as I first knew it.</span></span>

<p>"The settlers of those days may have had to live largely on 'bread and with it,'
but no heroes have greater claims on the World's history than the pioneers of
Nebraska. Earnest and indomitable, hard-working and self-denying, they labored

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.414.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.414.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.414.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

to make homes for their children, and they bore with fortitude—nay, with
unexampled good humor—all the misfortunes of frontier life.</p>

<p>"One day in August a forlorn, disheartened-looking team, drawing a rickety
wagon, passed through our 'city,' bearing a Western family back East for a
winter's visit to the 'wife's folks.' As they drove by, a crowd of young fellows gathered in front of the harness shop, and it became apparent from the looks and gestures of the spectators that they were poking fun at his rig. Quick as a flash the homesteader gave to his willing team the signal to stop, and leveling his long forefinger at the boys, shouted earnestly: 'Look here, strangers, I ain't so darned poor as you think I am. One of these horses isn't mine.'</p>

<p>"Such citizenship is one of the resources of Nebraska. The best harvest of
which any land can boast is brave and worthy men and omen. The best heritage
we can leave our children is an ancestry that merits their emulation. These if
things have left their impress upon Nebraska. Springing from such stock,
surrounded by such environments, who orders that everything here is done on
a large scale; that our stock fields are so extensive that we are spoken of as
the 'fodder land;' that we could furnish a necklace of corn cribs to encircle almost any territory desired, that our commerce, both internal and external, exceeds that of any other commonwealth of equal age, and that in the late Spanish skirmish we made a record that proves us worthy sons of the brave sires who, in the days of rebellion, from a population of thirty thousand—possibly seventy-five
hundred families—three thousand three hundred and seven officers and men
to fight for freedom.</p>

<p>To conclude, Nebraska is noted for her peculiarities, her possibilities and 
her productions. The fame of our pure air, Poland China pigs and pop-pop-popular government has gone abroad in the land. Who has not heard of our bright women, brainy men, and Bryan? here can you find the equal of our cattle, corn or country newspapers? Our crops are world-beaters; our Exposition beats the World's Fair; and our H/<em class="hi">World-Herald</em> can't be beat.</p>

<p>"The day has come when we can attune our voices not only to the melody
of pioneer days:</p>

<span class="lg song"><span class="l">"A home, a home,</span>
<span class="l">Where the deer and antelope play;</span>
<span class="l">Where seldom is heard</span>
<span class="l">A discouraging word,</span>
<span class="l">And the sky is not clouded all day.</span></span>

<p>"But remembering the achievements of the years gone by, can watch the more
majestic strains:</p>

<span class="lg song"><span class="l">"From Atlantic to rocky Sierras,</span>
<span class="l">No people more loyal or true,</span>
<span class="l">Nebraska, the gem of the prairies,</span>
<span class="l">The best 'neath' the red, white and blue."</span></span>

<p>G. W. Hurlbut, of the <em class="hi">Aurora Sun</em>, responded to the toast, "A Country's
Yokel."</p>

<p>W. J. White, of the <em class="hi">Exeter Enterprise</em>, responded to the toast, "The Late
Unpleasantness."</p>

<p>W. T. Howard, of the <em class="hi">Schuyler Sun</em>, responded to the toast, "The Exposition as an Educator." He closed his eloquent address with the following words:
"The memory of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition will ever remain an enduring
monument to Western energy and civilization, and of the minds who conceived
and carried the project to practical results."</p>

<p>The program closed with the toast, "The Country Press: Its Might and Its
Mercy," responded to by Edgar Hoard, of the <em class="hi">Papillion Times</em>.</p>

<p>SIOUX CITY DAY—August 25, 1898</p>

<p>The Sioux City residents came in force to celebrate their day on the

<p>KANSAS DAY—September 1, 1898</p> 

<p>Address of President Gurdon W. Wattles</p>

<p>"At the dedication of the Kansas building on these grounds, it as my
pleasure to speak briefly of the material resources, wealth and magnificent
proportions and fertility of the State. I can not allow this opportunity to pass without reviewing those historic events which for many years made Kansas
the battle-ground of public opinion, and which finally culminated in the Civil
War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the development of an independent
progressive civilization.</p>

<p>"During the possession of Spain and France of the vast territory which
no constitutes most of the Trans-Mississippi country, very little as known
of the country, then supposed to be a wilderness, only habitable by savage tribes. It is said that Coronado as the first white man to explore the State. He as in search of rich provinces, rumored to abound in magnificent cities, with untold wealth, For nearly three hundred years after his unsuccessful search, history is silent. In 1820, Major Long explored a part of the State, and described its prairies 'billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shade and sunshine. He found in the Western part of the State buffalo, elk and deer sufficient to feed all the savages in the United States for a century to come. But it as not until 1853 that settlers in any large numbers came to make their homes in this then unorganized territory. By the Kansas and Nebraska bill, which became a law in 1854, breaking the Missouri compromise of 1820, Kansas became the theater on which as to be enacted the first scene in the great drama of the Civil war. The contest for supremacy between the slaveholders and the abolitionists began when the Cavalier of the South and the Puritan of the North, with conflicting ideas in morality, religion and politics, met to contest for supremacy. For many years the enthusiasts of both sides of the great question of slavery emigrated from all parts of the North and South to this new territory and engaged in contention for principles rather than in the work of developing the resources of the State. The contests at the polls, at public meetings, and in legislative bodies, frequently culminated in scenes of blood and carnage which excited the passions of both sections represented. John brown as a fanatic only a few

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.417.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.417.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.417.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

degrees more enthusiastic than many others who went from the North and East
to prevent the territory from declaring for slavery. The occupation of these
early settlers as exciting but unprofitable. The framing of constitutions, the
election of legislatures and the frequent personal contests finally culminated in the triumph of the Free State Party, and the framing of a State Constitution, which as ratified by the people in 1859, and finally approved by Congress in 1861, when the State as admitted to the Union.</p>

<p>"In seven years Kansas had had seven territorial Governors, had framed
four State constitutions, and had attracted the attention of the world to the
great issue of human slavery. The remaining scenes in the drama were transferred to the halls of Congress, to the political organizations of the nation, and finally to the battle-fields of the Civil War, and the people of Kansas, after years of agitation and excitement, settled down to the more serious business of providing homes and bread for a rapidly increasing population; but their troubles were not to end. The year 1860 will forever be remembered as one of drouth and famine. The records show that from June, 1859, to November, 1860, there as not a shoer of rain at any time sufficient to et the earth to inches in depth. Throughout the entire State and many other States of the South the blasting blight of famine and want as felt. The word went out
throughout the land that men and women were starving, and would stiffer from
cold and hunger without the aid of other States. The great heart of the nation
as aroused by these appeals, and from every quarter of the country came the
response in aid of suffering humanity. The limited means of transportation
were taxed to their utmost to carry the gifts of the nation to the inhabitants
P of a suffering State. One-third of the population of the State returned to
Eastern friends and homes, and for many years the evil effects and exaggerated
reports of this great drouth retarded the growth of this rich State.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding this great calamity, those pioneers who remained on their
farms were richly rewarded by abundant crops and a period of prosperity which
enabled them to repay their debt to the nation by furnishing more troops in
proportion to population for the suppression of the rebellion than any other
State in the Union. </p>

<p>"The conflicting elements of the early pioneers became united by the
marriage of their sons and daughters. The question of slavery ceased to be an
issue, and its final solution by the Emancipation Proclamation cemented all
conflicting elements, leaving only the enthusiasm, the originality and the
independence of thought and action which at all times has characterized the
inhabitants of this State.</p>

<p>"Great men in State and national affairs, willing and able to assert and
maintain original and progressive principles in philosophy, morals, and politics, stand out in the history of the nation, forever placing Kansas in the front rank of reform. Kansas as one of the first States to declare for prohibition, to grant the mothers and sisters rights of property and franchise, to protest against the combinations of capital and greed of corporations. The names of Lane, Plumb and Ingalls have honored the State in the halls of Congress, while Glick,

Martin and Leedy are known throughout the land as men of original ideas with
the courage to enforce their convictions. Mrs. Lease and Jerry Simpson are
types of the original, aggressive and progressive elements which abound in this
State. We may denounce their theories, but we must admit their sincerity.</p>

<p>"With such a population, supplemented with a land of sunshine and rich
soil, unsurpassed in fertility by any other State in the 'Union, Kansas will
always be found in the front rank in all progressive enterprises among the
people of the lest. The State is always represented at conventions for the
promotion of Western interests. At this Exposition, which illustrates in such 
magnificence the wealth, progress and prosperity of the great West, Kansas takes her place with no apologies, and I anticipate that at the great livestock exhibit to be made here in October her livestock productions, which have an annual value of fifty million dollars, and her dairy products, second to those of no other State, will receive such recognition as their excellence and magnitude deserve.</p>

<p>"When we consider that the State is yet in its infancy in development, but that the annual product of its farms is greater in value than the entire output of the gold and silver mines of the Union, that the value of its livestock exceeds one hundred million dollars, that the wealth of the State aggregates one billion eight hundred million dollars, that the value of its annual manufactures is equal to its farm products, and that all this wealth and progress has been accumulated and made within a single generation, we can but prophesy a future for this State abounding in wealth and progress beyond the dreams of the wildest imagination.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of the nation are no rejoicing over the victories of our
army and navy, which have been achieved by the bravery of our soldiers and
sailors. Grave problems are to be solved by the more peaceful but not less
potent contests of diplomacy yet to follow. The acquisition of new territory,
inhabited by people of inferior civilization, is one of the important subjects for consideration. A careful study of the undeveloped resources of our present
magnificent domain should be one of the first duties of all statesmen charged in with the solution of this important and far-reaching subject. within the
boundaries of the State of Kansas there are more than a million acres of
Government land, subject to homestead entry, as rich and fertile as Cuba or the
Philippines, which only awaits the application of irrigation from the mountain
streams to support a population equal to the present population of the State.
The same is true of many other of the States and territories lying West of the 
if Mississippi. There are mines in our mountains with untold wealth yet undiscovered. Our farmers only need capital to erect factories which will produce sugar from beets in greater quantities than can be extracted from the cane

which grows in Hawaii and Cuba. Whether the energies of our people should
be diverted to the conquest of foreign, uncivilized subjects, or be expended in
developing and building up the untold resources of our present domain, is a
question worthy of the most serious consideration. "This occasion is neither proper nor opportune for the discussion of serious subjects of policy or politics. I congratulate the people of Kansas on the magnificent opportunities this State offers to homeseekers and investors. I congratulate the State on the enterprise and energy of its citizens, displayed in the beautiful building and splendid exhibit at this Exposition. I congratulate the Governor of the State, the Commissioners and all of its citizens here today on the success of Kansas Day, and wish for them one and all such prosperity as the fortitude of their pioneers and the enthusiasm and enterprise of their
citizens deserve."</p>

<p>ADDRESS, GOVERNOR LESLIE M. SHAW</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens and Friends of Iowa: 'Not many generations
ago, in the place here you no sit, encircled by all that exalts and embellishes
civilized life, the rank thistle nodded in the breeze, and the wild fox digged his
hole unscared.' So said Charles Sprague, three-quarters of a century ago, and the utterance is as do true when applied to the land of the Omahas as to
the land of the Wampanoags.</p>

<p>"We meet this day as citizens of Iowa, on the
soil of a sister State, for no idle purpose. The
people of Iowa are not idlers, but the day will
have been lost to us and to our children, unless
what is here said, and done, and witnessed, and
enjoyed, shall bring greater thoughtfulness and
increased earnestness. The half century and two
years since the admission of Iowa added the
twenty-ninth star to the flag which has now become
the protector of the world have wrought great
changes. Most of the improvements of earth,

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Leslie M. Shaw, Governor of Iowa</p>
 
</div>

most of the progress in the arts and sciences, most
of the advance in civilization, have been wrought within the period of our
State history. Time would not permit, if the inclination were present, to recount

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.423.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.423.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.423.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the achievements in the political, industrial, financial, agricultural, mechanical,
scientific, educational, religious or moral world. Suffice it to say that in all
of these Iowa has rendered her full share of service, and has reaped her full 
measure of blessing. We can well afford to leave to others the study of the 
past. Let it be ours manfully to face the future, no more than ever big
with possibilities, and with careful glance. ahead improve the present.</p>

<p>"In all the grand exhibit of this remarkable Exposition there is not found that
for which our State has greatest reason to rejoice. The product of the farm, of
the orchard, of the garden, of the herd, of the dairy, of the factory, of the mine
are here in great quantity and of superb quality. Truly, Iowa is great in territory,
great in resources, great in product, and she is greatest of all in her children.
There is presented to my eye from the platform that which is infinitely more 
valuable than all herds and all harvests. I see scattered through this audience 
many of the youth of Iowa. They are from the city, from the ton, from the
hamlet, and from the Iowa farm. They are representative of an aggregate of
seven hundred thousand of school age, and of an equal number who have just 
passed from educational tuition to face the activities, the anxieties, and the achievements of manhood and womanhood. These all belong to a generation which will
surely be heard from. Their fathers and mothers have been industrious, have
been ambitious, have been hopeful, and have been successful. A generation thus
circumstanced is always potential. Dr. Strong tells of a township in the Western
reserve which as settled with an energetic, liberty-loving, God-fearing, educationally inclined people, and which in a limited period furnished many members
of the State Legislature. From that community of only a few hundred inhabitants 
men went forth to college professorships east and West, to the supreme bench of 
the State, and to the United States Congress. Northampton, Mass., has among
its native and resident population over four hundred graduates from colleges and
other educational institutions; it has furnished the world with one hundred and
fourteen ministers, eighty-four ministers' wives, ten missionaries, twenty-five
judges, one hundred and to layers, ninety-five physicians, seven college presidents, thirty professors, sixty-four other educators, twenty-four editors, six a
historians, twenty-four authors, to governors, and thirty other State officers, 
twenty-five members of the State General Court, as the Legislature is styled, to
generals, six colonels, thirteen other army officers, and thirty-eight officers of
the United States, among them a Secretary of the Navy, to Foreign Ministers,
a Treasurer of the United States. five Senators of the United States, eight 
members of Congress and one President. If a territory six miles square, under 
favorable conditions, can make such a record, h at may we not hopefully expect
from a territory containing fifty-five thousand square miles, all of it similarly 
peopled, and with conditions more favorable than Massachusetts ever enjoyed or
Ohio ever possessed?</p>

<p>"'Know thyself said the Greek philosopher. 'Know thine opportunity' has
become a companion and equally important maxim.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.424.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.424.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.424.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"When you go home tonight tell the children that the world is big and
constantly expanding; that this day's experience has broadened your vision; that
life had become more real and hope more ardent; and that both you and the world,
and especially the States, expect something of them. Wake the boy in the night,
break in upon his dreams with stories of hopeful possibilities; watch the fire
kindle in his eye; let him dream again of greater things, of broader expanses,
we of higher altitudes, of noble achievements. Neglect neither seed time nor harvest;
watch the growing and maturing crops; succor and protect both flocks and herds;
zealously guard the interests of the shop and the store and the office; but, above
all, look well to the youth of Iowa, and to all things that shall conserve the
generation whose footsteps crowd the threshold of the World's activities."</p>

<p>PRESIDENT WATTLES' WELCOME</p>

<p>"When I received the invitation from the Iowa Commission to make an
address on this occasion, I at once realized my inability within the limited time
It at my disposal to express in a fitting manner even my on sentiments regarding
a State among whose inhabitants twenty-five years of my life had been spent, of
a State in whose public schools and colleges I received my education, and to
whose magnificent advantages and opportunities I am indebted for whatever
business success I may have attained. With apologies for apparent disloyalty to 
my adopted State of Nebraska, I say, without fear of successful contradiction, that Iowa is the best agricultural State in the Union. There is a smaller percentage of untillable land in this State than is found in any other equal body of
land in the world. The State has less illiteracy, more school-houses and churches,
and a fewer number of criminals in proportion to population than any other State
I in the Union. It has a better code of las, a more industrious, frugal and prosperous population; its wealth is more evenly distributed among its inhabitants, its a
climate is more healthy, and its people more contented and happy than the
average State of this country or in any other State or territory of like extent in
any other country in the world.</p>

<p>"These may seem extravagant statements, but they are subject to verification
by facts and figures. The question may be asked, why should this be true. The
answer is plain and in perfect accord with the philosophy and history of all past
ages. Agriculture is the source of all wealth; it breeds contentment, virtue and
happiness. 'From the farms comes not only the bread but the virtue of this
nation.' The principal avocation of the inhabitants of Iowa is farming. There
are no large metropolitan cities to corrupt the morals and excite the greed of its
inhabitants. There are no mines of gold and silver to attract and disappoint its
people. It is true that a large area of the State is underlaid with rich deposits
of coal, but beyond this its mineral wealth is confined to small districts where 
lead and zinc are found. The State lies within that temperate belt of latitude
along which the progress, intelligence, wealth and energy of the world are most.
abundantly found. Neither the long hot summers of the southern climes nor the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.425.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.425.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.425.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

cold rigorous inters of the Northern States enervates its inhabitants. The soil
is rich and productive, cereals and fruits mature alike in abundance. All of the
elements that produce happiness, contentment and prosperity combine and conspire
to make its inhabitants intelligent, prosperous and contented.</p>

<p>"But, with all its natural advantages, a large majority of its inhabitants have
earned for themselves from its rich resources the competency they no enjoy. It
is truly said 'there is no excellence without labor,' and but for the labor, hardships
and privations of the early settlers of this great commonwealth, I doubt if they or
their descendants would today occupy the high places in the business world
which they have attained. The early pioneers were all poor, and but few of the
later settlers had more than a few dollars with which to begin life. The privations
of those who first entered the lands in the center of the State, purchased of the
Black Hawk Indians, were sufficient to develop the energy and inspire that
determined effort which always brings success. In the fifties, when no railroad

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Iowa Building</p>
 
</div>

had penetrated the State, when heat
was hauled to hundred miles by
wagon and sold at forty cents per
bushel, when farm produce for want of
a market as worthless, with the fear
of the Indian massacre and the everpresent dread of sickness and want on
the frontier, far away from medical
or neighborly aid, their trials were
supreme. Surrounded with perplexities and almost overcome by obstacles,
which to the present generation would
seem insurmountable, with no roads
and no bridges, in the solitude and
loneliness and amid the awful stillness which pervades a new land like this, these
pioneers learned lessons of frugality, economy and a self-reliance which insured
for them and their descendants success and prosperity, and an appreciation of
the comforts and conveniences which came later with advanced civilization. Later
immigrants, who came into the State with such a flood during the sixties immediately after the great Rebellion, suffered privations little less severe than those
endured by the earlier pioneers.</p>

<p>"As a boy whose earlier years had been spent in populous communities, I well
remember the solitude of those prairies extending as far as the eye could reach
with no sign of life, with their billows of grass rolling like the great waves of the
sea. I can picture in memory the illumination of the heavens in autumn, when
great prairie fires sept with terrible conflagration the broad expanse of unoccupied lands, and lighted the skies with fiery tongues which seemed to portend
destruction of the settlements they surrounded. In many instances in the early
days these prairie fires sept with terrible velocity through fields of ripening
corn and laid waste the crops and buildings, and sometimes consumed the entire

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.426.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.426.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.426.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

possessions of the hapless settler who was exposed to their grand and destructive
holocaust. I can well remember when these prairies were thought to be worthless,
when the only settlements were along the wooded streams, and when it as said
that man could not live through the rigorous storms that blew with such velocity
with nothing to break their force across these plains in inter, and when the
first man ventured out from the shelter of the woods to make his home on the
A open prairie he as thought to be insane. Ho glad the hearts of those settlers
to hear the first screech of the locomotive, and the sound of the approach of the
first railway train. Each additional evidence of civilization as appreciated
beyond the power of the imagination of those who have never known want of the
present advantages at our doors.</p>

<p>"It as this school in these early days which reared within the State of Iowa
a self-reliant, industrious and frugal population, which has given caste to all subsequent settlement. These early settlers and their descendants on their homes
today, and are surrounded by many of the comforts and conveniences of life.
They are happy in the comparison of their changed conditions. They have on
for themselves by their individual efforts the reward which follows honest toil.
I have known hundreds, yes, thousands, of the present prosperous heads of
families in Iowa who came to the State in poverty, and who today are free from
debt and on their rich, well stocked and productive farms. Who can wonder
that such a population, surrounded as they are with all the conveniences of civilization, should be intelligent, prosperous and happy?</p>

<p>"Ever ready to promote the interests of their State by advertising its resources, Iowa as the first through her Legislature to approve of this Exposition, and the first State in the Union to make an appropriation for a State exhibit
here. She stands among the first in the beauty and convenience of her building
and the variety and extent of her exhibit. It is with pride and pleasure that
welcome her citizens here today. This Exposition is the crowning achievement 
of the people of the West; it marks an epoch in the history of their progress; it
serves notice to all the world that the West is no longer lacking in population,
wealth and enterprise, and it reveals a vision of future development which will
eclipse its phenomenal past.</p>

<p>"When we consider the wonderful strides that have been made in all of the
States and territories West of the Mississippi River during the short space of
half a century; when we compute the wealth that has been accumulated; when we
realize that eighty thousand miles of railroad have been constructed, great cities
built and a commerce double that of Spain and Portugal established; when we
know and realize that in no other part of the world such opportunities for the
investor and home-seeker are offered as can be found within this territory, we
can picture in our imagination its future greatness and power. when I think
of the wonderful changes that have been wrought within the State of Iowa within
the past thirty years, how the Redmen have been driven from their grounds to
make room for the rich farms and cities which no support a population of more
than to million people, of how schools and colleges have been built, public

institutions for the promotion of education, morality, Christianity and good
government established, and how out of the chaos and stillness of the wilderness
such a commonwealth has grown within the memory of even the young men of
this generation, I almost believe it must be the dawn of the millennium, when
happiness, prosperity and contentment, such as the world has never known, is to
permeate the lives of all men. when I stand and vie the magnificence and
wealth of the West displayed at this Exposition, I almost feel like the rural farmer,
who, on entering these grounds a short time ago exclaimed, 'If heaven is only as
beautiful I shall be satisfied.'</p>

<p>"To all the beauties of these grounds and the pleasures to be found in viewing
the wonderful resources displayed in these buildings, I invite the visitors from
Iowa to participate. This Exposition is yours as well as ours, you are equal
partners in the enterprise, and from its success, no happily insured, you may
learn many lessons of value for the future. It not only illustrates the wealth and
progress of a great people, but it points to future possibilities undreamed of before.
To the homeless millions of less favored climes it is a messenger of promise; to the
weary mariner whose fortunes have been wrecked on the seas of adversity it is a
harbinger of hope; it opens new fields to the inventor, inspires the ambition of the
genius, incites the emulation of States and stands the crowning glory in the history
of the West."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. ROBERT G. COUSINS, CONGRESSMAN</p>

<p>"The State of Iowa accepts with fraternal gladness the hospitable hand of
greeting extended by Nebraska and our other sister States in this great Empire
of the pioneers, and salutes with reverent patriotism the Federal Government of
the United States.</p>

<p>"In the words of that original and poetic genius, 'Ironquill,' who has voiced so well the thought and feelings of our West land, and who has made the name of Kansas known forever in the world of letters:</p>

<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">"States are not great,</span>
<span class="l">Except as men may make them.</span>
<span class="l">Men are not great, except they do and dare.</span>

<span class="l">All merit comes from braving the unequal;</span>
<span class="l">All glory comes from daring to begin.</span></span>

<p>"I have asked five of the ablest and the most noted Americans what they
regard as the chief thing or leading feature of the Trans-Mississippi region, and they have invariably answered, 'Its men and women.' The other day I met one
of the oldest settlers of Eastern Iowa—one of those original, rugged characters whose it and wisdom has lightened the settlers' hearts and homes for many a toilsome year—one of those interesting characters who never bores you, and whom one always likes to meet—a man whose head is silvered and whose countenance is kind—and I asked him what he regarded as the principal feature

of our Trans-Mississippi country, and he replied: 'Well, I'm no scholar, but I've been round here nigh onto sixty years and I reckon 'bout the most important thing is the folks and the farms.'</p>

<p>"While you rest here a little while in this splendid Auditorium, before going to vie the wonders and the beauties of the Exposition (and incidentally the Midway) I shall speak briefly of the folks and farms of my native State of Iowa and of this Empire of the pioneers. In doing so, I have some hesitation, realizing as I do that there are doubtless those in this vast
audience who were contemporaries with my grandfathers in the early settlement of Iowa away back in the thirties, and who are far better qualified to
tell the tale of toil and triumph which is the glory
and the honor of our birthland. In such a discussion I feel as though I were standing on the bank of a magnificent stream in the hearing of
patriarchs and pilgrims who have traveled from its
source. I can look at its sift flowing current and
think of the scenes by which it has sept in its
lonely way from the wilds here it started; I can
remember with you the roaming redman who
watched with jealous eye the coming of this Anglo-Saxon stream of civilization; I can marvel with

you at the vastness of the products of its soil,
watered with the tears of happiness and toil; I can realize with you the ruggedness and patience of its manhood and the strength and gentleness of its
womanhood, but of its landscape farther up, its tributaries and its cabins, its
haunts and huts and wonders, its picturesqueness of primeval life, the story
is far better told by him whose tired feet have trudged along the way, whose
hands have toiled and whose hair has turned to gray.</p>

<p>"Iowa became a separate territory, with the capital at Burlington, in 1838, and
as admitted into the Union in 1846, and has been in it ever since. It makes
little difference whether it as first settled by the whites at Dubuque for mining
purposes in 1788, or for trading purposes at Montrose in 1799, or opposite
Prairie du Chien in 1804 or 5, or in Lee County at Sandusky in 1820, or on the
lower rapids, at what is no known as Nashville, in 1829; or whether the first
settlements for general purposes were made at Burlington and Davenport in 1832.
The main facts are that it as well settled—not by dyspeptic tourists, nor by invalids who had come West out of curiosity, nor by climate-seeking dilettanti with to servants and one lung—but by the best bone and sine of the Middle States, New England and the Old World. I do not know that there were any dukes, or lords, or marquises or duchesses, but there were Dutch and Irish,
and Scotch and Scotch-Irish, and English and Americans, and they had home
rule right from the start—at least they had in the first school which I attended. The men and women who settled the Hawkeye State were not those who expected

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.429.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.429.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.429.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

to go back 'in the fall' or as soon as they could prove up their claims. They
were 'stayers.' They were not men to be discouraged by inter or by work.
They were men who knew that nobody ever amounted to much unless he had to
Most of them began simply with the capital of honesty, good health and their
inherent qualities of character. They built their cabins in the clearings, and,
watching the smoke curl up in the great wide sky, felt just as patriotic for their humble rustic homes as e'er did princes for their castles, or millionaires for mansions grand.</p>

<p>"To build a home is a great thing. It doesn't matter so much about the
dimensions. 'Kings have lived in cottages and pygmies dwelt in palaces but the
walls of a home always add something to inherent character. In the formation
of character there are always to elements, the inherent and the adventitious—that which we bring with us into the world and that which our surroundings give us. Somebody said, 'There is only a small portion of the earth that produces in splendid people.' Our pioneers got into a good place. They had left doubt sitting on a boulder in the East and packed their things and started for the West. Rivers had to be forded, trees to be felled; cabins had to be built—the rifle must be kept loaded-so much the better, there as self-reliance. Corn and coffee had to be ground, and on the same mill—so much the better, there as ingenuity. Teeth had to be filled, and there as no painless dentistry. Disease and injury must be dealt with, and the doctor fifty miles away. Life must be lightened, lonely hearts must be cheered, and the old friends and comrades far back in the States or maybe away in the Fatherland, and the cheering letter tarrying with the belated stage coach-hold fast, thou sturdy denizen and gentle help-mate of the rich and wondrous Empire, infinite goodness guards thee and the fertile fields are ready to reward.</p>

<p>"Ah, pampered people of the later generations, when you imagine modern
hardships, think of the courage and the trials and the ingenuity of pioneers when there were no conveniences but the forest and the axe, the wide rolling prairie and the ox team, the great blue sky, the unsolved future and the annual ague. Complain of markets in these modern times and then think of your grandmother when she as a blooming bride listening through the toilsome days and anxious nights for the agon bringing home the husband from a distant market with calico and jeans purchased with dressed pork, sold one dollar and a half a hundred, and maybe bringing home a little money, worth far less per yard than either calico or jeans. Maybe it as all for the best; human character as being formed for the development of a great and loyal and progressive State to shine forever we among the stars of the Federal Union.</p>

<p>"Probably the purest time in the history of government and men is when they are painfully intent upon the labor of their development and defense. Most
all greatness and nearly every original idea has come out of some kind of trouble. however gets to greatness or success without meeting opposition goes in an air castle. Most of the flowers of genius have bloomed from bleeding hearts. There never as a strong and handsome face without some little line of care.

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.430.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.430.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.430.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

And so every circumstance of those early toilsome lives, every tedious trial,
every tear, every home whose roof kept out the storm and whose walls contained their sorrows and their joys; all the gifts of a generous soil in return for
careful cultivation; every irritating inconvenience, which finally drove some
questioning mind to ponder out improvements—all such experiences are as certain
in their formation and development of character and mind as are inherent qualities
that accompany the origin and mystery of life.</p>

<p>"Somewhere I have seen an etching of a face that as called 'Experience,'
and I have never forgotten it—one never does forget a face that has ideas in it.
This one as the illustrated history of a life. There as youth, with all its hope,
marked here and there with all the lines of strife and care and victory, which
middle life had placed upon it. And there as the mystic touch of later years,
like Autumn's pencil work in nature, all shaded with the mellow haze of time—
a kind of soft and silvery veil with which deft nature covers up her glory—a
picture penciled by an artist with an understanding mind, who knew his subject
had thought as he had thought, felt as he had felt, dreamed as he had dreamed—
a kind of picture that one sees so very, very seldom, only as often as one finds
genius—the divine—and I thought, there is the typical picture of a pioneer, and
well named 'Experience.'</p>

<p>"Civil government in Iowa proceeded with its rapid settlement. The pioneer
became a model citizen. He knew the necessity for the las that were enacted.
He did not feel oppressed by government. He had experienced the losses of
robbery and larceny, and knew something of the embarrassment and inconvenience
of being scalped. There as no hysteria about trusts and combines, because
they had practiced combinations themselves for mutual protection. If anyone
would learn the true genius and exemplification and philosophy of self-government, government of and for and by the people, let him study the records of
pioneer life and institutional beginnings and the evolution of their laws. It
would be worth our while on some suitable occasion, when time permitted, to
talk over the interesting incidents attending the administration of justice in the
early days of Iowa, incident of its territorial legislatures, the birth and growth
of its statehood and the characters of its officials. But the greatness of our State
is not contained in any name. Its official history is the exponent of its industrial
life and character. Its greatness is the sum total of its citizenship. In order to be
just, John Jones, the average citizen, must be mentioned along with our most
illustrious officials. Somebody said that the history of a nation is the history
of its great men, but there is an unwritten history which that averment overlooks.
The growth of a State is the progress of its average citizen. The credit of a
commonwealth is the thrift of its John Jones and William Smith, and the
character, prosperity and patriotism of the individual citizen is the history of Iowa.</p>

<p>"The population of ninety-seven thousand which she had when admitted into
the Union had increased to seven hundred and fifty four thousand six hundred
and ninety-nine at the close of the Civil war. Of these, about seventy thousand,
almost one-tenth of the population, were in the war- a number equal to nearly

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.431.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.431.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.431.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

one-half the voters of the State. Who made the history of Iowa during that
great struggle of our nation's life? John Jones, the average citizen, whether
he carried a musket helping to put up the scattered stars of State back
into the constellation of the Union, or whether he toiled from early dawn to
lingering twilight in the fields or in the shop. The best civilization is that which
maintains the highest standard of life for its average citizen.</p>

<p>"Since the Civil War, the State of Iowa has increased in population to
almost to million to hundred and twenty-five thousand of people, and most
of the time had the least illiteracy of any State in the Union. Doubtless for that
we are indebted to many of the older States, whose enterprising and courageous
citizens constitute so large a portion of our population. with but half a century
of statehood, and with an area of about fifty-five thousand four hundred seventy
square miles, the State of Iowa produces the greatest quantity of cereals of
any State in the Union. As long ago as the last Federal census, taken in 1890,
it produced more corn, more oats, more beef, more pork than any other State
in the Union. Not long since I as introduced to a gentleman from New York
City. He said: 'Oh, from Iowa—ah—let me see, that's out—ah—you see, I'm
not very well posted on the geography of the West.' 'Yes,' I said, 'it's out
by there just across the Mississippi River. You can leave New York about noon
and get your supper in Iowa the next evening. It might be worth your while
to look it up. It's the State which produces more of the things which people
eat than any other State in the Union. It has more miles of railroad than your
State of New York, more than Mexico, more than Brazil and more than all
the New England States combined.'</p>

<p>"The value of Iowa's agricultural products and livestock, in round numbers
for the year 1892, as four hundred and seven million dollars, to say nothing
of her other great and various industries and enterprises. She produced that
year one hundred and sixty-two million pounds of the best butter on earth, of
the value of thirty-two million dollars. The Hawkeye butter ladle has achieved
a cunning that challenges all Columbia. The Iowa co has slowly and painfully,
yet gradually and grandly, worked her way upward to a shining eminence in the
eyes of the world. The State of Iowa has on her soil today, if nothing will befalls
it, ninety million dollars worth of corn. The permanent value of land is estimated
by its corn-producing qualities. Of all the products of the earth, corn is king,
and it reigns in Iowa.</p>

<p>"Industry and nature have made the State of Iowa a creditor. Her soil
has always been solvent, and her system of farming does not tend to pauperize
it. She is a constant seller, and therefore ants the evidence of the transaction
to be unimpeachable. She has more school teachers than any other State except
the Empire State, and only three and six-tenths per cent of her population are
illiterate. The State of Iowa has yielded the grandest dividends on her educational
investments. She has become illustrious on account of her enlightenment. She
has progressed further from 'primitive indifferent tissue' than the land even of
Darwin himself, and in her escape from protoplasm and prejudice she is practically

out of danger. Marked out in the beginning by the hand of God, bounded on the
east and West by the to great rivers of the continent, purified and stimulated
by the snows of inter, blessed with copious rainfall in the growing season, with
generous soil and stately forests interspersed, no wonder that the dusky aborigines
exclaimed, when they crossed the 'Father of Waters of,' 'Iowa! This is the place.'
Not only did the red man give our State its beautiful and poetic name, but
Indian nomenclature runs like a romance throughout the counties and communities. What infinite meaning, what tokens of joy and sadness, of triumph and of tears, of valor and of vanquishment, of life and love and song there may be in these weird, strange words that name today so many of our towns and streams and counties—Allamakee, Chickasa, Dakota City, Sioux, Pocahontas,
Winneshiek, Keosauqua, Sac, Winnebago, Tama, Nodawa, Compeine, Charlton,
Comanche, Cherokee, Waukon, Muchakinock, Washta, Monona, Wapeton,
Onawa, Keota, Waudina, Ioka, Ottuma, Oneska, Waucoma, Nishnabotna,
Keokuk, Decorah, Wapello, Muscatine, Maquoketa, Mahaska, Ocheyeden, Mississippi, Appanoose, Missouri, Quasqueton, Anamosa, Poeshiek, Pottawattamie,
Osceola, Oskaloosa, Wapsipinicon.</p>

<p>"Ere long some westland genius, moved by the mystic inspiration of the
rich and wondrous heritage of Iowa nativity, may sing the song of our legends
and traditions, may voice in verse the wondrous story of his illustrious State.
Maybe somewhere among the humble homes here blood and bone and brain
grow pure and strong; here simple food and frugal ways feeds wondering
minds and drive them craving into nature's secrets and her songs—somewhere
along the settler's pathway or by the Indian trail where now the country churchyards, grown with uncut grasses, hide the forms of sturdy ancestors sleeping all
in peaceful ignorance of wayward sons or wondrous progeny—somewhere where
rising sun beholds the peasantry at early toil and leaves them in the mystic
twilight were their tasks are done, here odors of the corn and new-mown hay
and vine-clad hedges, by the shadowy roadside, linger long into the night-time
as a sweet and sacred balm for tired hearts-somewhere, sometime, the song
of Iowa shall rise and live, and it will not omit the thought of that gifted son
who said: 'Iowa: the affections of her people, like the rivers of her borders,
flow to an inseparable union.'</p>

<p>"And now, my fellow-citizens, a word about our great Trans-Mississippi
region—the empire of the pioneers—and, of our country and its future.</p>

<p>We have on this side of the Mississippi River an area of to million one
hundred forty-three thousand one hundred fifty-five square miles of land, to
and a quarter times the area east of the Mississippi. You could put England,
Ireland, Scotland, the German Empire, France, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Spain
and all of the United States east of the Mississippi into this Trans-Mississippi
territory without touching California or Hawaii, and Admiral Dewey would still
have the Pacific Ocean and Manila, with rope enough to lasso and hang the
last enemy of the United States and civilization.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.433.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.433.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.433.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"The population east of the Mississippi in 1890 as forty-five million nine
hundred seventy-nine thousand seven hundred fifty-four, having increased 18
per cent in the ten preceding years. The population West of the Mississippi in
1890 as sixteen million six hundred forty-two thousand four hundred ninety-six, an increase of 93 per cent in the preceding decade. The wealth per capita
east of the Mississippi increased 22.75 per cent from 1880 to 1890, and increased
69.5 per cent West of the Mississippi in the same decade.</p>

<p>"The State of Minnesota alone produces nearly one-eighth of the flour of
the United States, and Texas furnishes one-fifth of the cotton; Iowa, Kansas,
Nebraska and Missouri produce nearly half of the entire corn product of the
country, over one-fourth of the beef and more than one-third of the pork. No
other territory in the world of equal area produces so much of the substantial
food of life.</p>

<p>"Being a perpetual creditor, on account of its productions, the Western
region and all its States have a common interest in the largest possible employment of people in other avocations than producing food, because employment not
only creates appetite, but likewise the financial ability to satisfy it. The
western region and its many States also have a common interest in honesty.
Having given their labor for a large increase in wealth per capita—the largest
of any section of the country--they are naturally interested in maintaining it.
No one has a greater interest in the vested value of a dollar than he who has
exchanged his labor and his products for it, or who has a constant surplus to be
sold and registers as accumulated wealth. You labor today and accumulate
thereby. You may want to rest tomorrow. Your accumulation should be secure.
You have been selling all these years. You may wish to buy or build tomorrow.
The credit registered by your toil, frugality and prudence should be forever
sacred. The West should look to the future and think not only of its gains
in one decade, but of the balance that will be to its credit in a hundred years
from now. Do not forget that the world must eat, and that mankind is multiplying
by the millions, and that the Creator is not making any more land on this planet.
Hold fast to the heritage which God and the pioneers have left you, and to the
standard of integrity and value by which it as earned. Let the future buy from
you according to that same standard by which you have bought, and by which
your toil is measured in the present.</p>

<p>"No one can foretell a limit of the possibilities of this great, producing, half-developed region for the future, with the United States forging to the front
in the commerce of the world, claiming its harbors and its coaling stations along
the lines of trade in the uttermost parts of the earth and realizing more than
ever before that it is a joint proprietor with the older nations of the earth in
the great high seas. Doubtless some people are over-reckless for expansion, and
some are so conservative that their intellectual estates seem almost in probate.
Douglas Harrold used to say, 'There are some people so conservative that they
can never appreciate the new moon out of regard for that venerable institution,
the old one.' And Wendell Phillips added, 'Some people are afraid to sweep off

the cobwebs for fear the roof will come down.' But there is one thing reason-
ably certain: America will have a place to land and coal her ships in every quarter
of the globe. There has been the age of marble and the age of bronze; ours
is the age of commerce and of iron. Commerce will not stop; it undermines
the mountains, lays its tables underneath the billows of the sea, and scorns the
fury of its crests. Commerce is a greedy, moiling, tireless spider, catching all
the world in a web of iron, and it will weave its wires wherever there is life.
It has found the Orient and the Occident, and will never rest until it ties its
cables to the poles.</p>

<p>"America will build a greater navy, and will build the Nicaragua canal,
and her merchant ships will take her commerce into all the harbors of the world,
and our battleships shall protect our commerce in its legitimate and rightful
course. The American flag shall be visible and revered away from home as it
if is beloved and venerated here, and under it a free people shall thrive and multiply
in peace.</p>

<p>"If one were to rite a prophetic history of the next century and insist
upon it with any degree of obstinacy, he would doubtless be deemed insane.
If Washington, when he retired from public life, had uttered one-half the truth
of events that have since transpired, even Americans would have said that the
pressure of official responsibility had rendered the Father of his Country a
victim of dementia, and the world would have doubtless pronounced him crazy.
If some optimist of New England had said a hundred years ago, as has transpired and been declared since then, that in the nineteenth century science would
pierce through mountains that ancient poetry could never scale, whisper across
the ocean, tame the lightning, annihilate space, explode superstition. create light,
bottle up sound, he might have been arrested for witchcraft. If at the time
when a hundred and eighty crimes were punishable with death some judge
or jurist had recognized the sunrise of civilization and had declared that the
time would soon come when the greatest nation of the earth would inflict the
death penalty for only to offenses, he might have been deposed for his opinion.
If any one were to remind you no of one-half century that is gone and foretell
one-half the century to come, he would be regarded as a dangerous man and
rickety, and it would be used against him in the next campaign, no matter on
what ticket he should run. The fact is that not many realize the rate at which
the world is traveling. Time is so noiseless that it awakens very few. The Rip
Van Winkles are as numerous as the Smiths and Browns and Joneses. While
we are yet shaking hands with the events of yesterday, genius taps us on the
shoulder and introduces a stranger and we exclaim, 'What imposter is this ?'
An impossibility; an event of the future.</p>

<p>"What shall be the events of the coming century? Probably with whatever
degree of certainty we are able to comprehend the past and to understand the
present, with that degree can we foretell the future. Yesterday and today are

that the great events of the near future shall be in the line of commerce, as I
have already indicated, of jurisprudence, of social economy, of science and of art.
The tendency of the times is to get rid of long-established humbugs. The wisdom
of the past shall be retained, but the wings of progress shall not be burdened by
its evils and stupidity. So long as toil shall bend the back of man his brain shall
question science for its mysteries, and so long as mystery remains to form the
boundary line of knowledge the scientists will strive and climb and climb and
reach beyond those bonds. They will make the electric current turn the heels
of all the world.</p>

<p>"And in our coming century there will be tumults, strife and riot, but there
shall be no ruin. America shall be ruled by law. She will not forget the lessons
that her patriots have taught. She will abide by the Pilgrims' covenant—the
legally expressed will of the majority.</p>

<p>"And in the future, striving and contending, with all the ceaseless, tireless
energies, in that stately and majestic march of time and toil, there will be success
and failure, thrift and slothfulness, charity and meanness, hope and doubt,
happiness and misery, And some time it will lift up its voice and America
shall hear great music—such as she has never known before—and there shall
be great artists. Some one has said that America is too busy to make verses,
too serious to sing songs; that all her ideas are marshalled up in battle array to
solve the vital questions of self-government, and that all her jewels are wrought
into diadems to agricultural the kings of commerce and the lords of science, whilst
poetry is sept away by the tide of activity that sells through every artery and
vein of Columbia's land. And all that has been very true. But it shall not
always be so. We shall not always take our melodies from old operas nor
our designs from ancient frescoes. We shall not always dig our architecture
from the ruins of the past nor get our fiction from the brains of dead men.
The same conditions that bred the genius of dead Empires shall find the muses
A and the artists for Columbia and a greater glory shall await them, for they
shall all be born in freedom.</p>

<p>"By and by some millionaire, tired of killing pigs and packing pork, will
see something beautiful or maybe something sad, and he will endow an institution here poverty can come and dream and mark its pain and thought upon the
canvas and the marble. And, then, some other hoarder of the millions shall grow
weary concerning kerosene and corn, and he will hear some voice, or see some fair
young face with a little line of care upon its arched and thoughtful brow,
he will say to genius, 'Come, these walls shall keep the winds from shriveling
up your tender wings on which you no may rise and soar, and out of all your
misery that is past make harmonies that will soften all the sorrows of mankind,
revive the melodies that have been dying through all the centuries of time
with the pain of silence, and out of the inspiration that may come to you rite
rhapsodies that will lift and glorify the thoughts and minds of men and find
we the very throne of God} Emerson declared a little while before he died: 'we

think our civilization near its meridian, but we are yet only at the cock crowing and the morning star.' The future will verify Emerson. The greatest
alliance ever projected in history will be the alliance of American efforts and
American interests. Into the opening gateway of the twentieth century, hand
in hand, shall spring our king of commerce and queen of industry, the Sphinx-eyed scientist and his bride of art, the sturdy son of agriculture and the dreaming child of song, and their thought and soil and song shall honor and inspire the great."</p>

the Cadet Battalion of the Iowa Agricultural College, and a reception at the

<p>CHICAGO DAY—October 1, 1898</p>

<p>The citizens of Chicago planned to make Chicago Day at our Exposition
one of its great days. Several special trains were engaged to convey the crowds
from Chicago to the Exposition. One of those trains brought Mayor Harrison,
and the city officials of Chicago, with their wives and families. The members

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.438.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.438.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.438.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of the Union League Club of Chicago, with their wives and friends, filled
another; one conveyed the members of the Board of Trade, the Commissioners
of the World's Fair of Chicago and their friends; while another as filled
with members of the Chicago Athletic Club and the Marquette Club. Several
special cars were attached to the regular trains to accommodate the railway
officials of Chicago, the Cook County Marching Club and many other prominent
citizens. with all these prominent visitors, there came a great number on the
regular trains who took advantage of the low rate of fare the railroads had
made from Chicago to Omaha and return. The visitors began to arrive early
in the day and were met at the depot by the Exposition officials, the Mayor and
city officials and many of Omaha's prominent citizens. A parade as formed
at the depot, headed by Mayor Moores and Mayor Harrison, followed by numerous bands of music and the Cook County Marching Club in uniform. The procession marched north on Tenth Street to Farnam, West on Farnam to Fourteenth, here it disbanded.</p>

<p>The World's Fair Commissioners, the city officials, the speakers of the
day, and the Illinois State Commission eremet at the Paxton Hotel and conveyed in carriages to the Exposition grounds. The exercises of the day were
held in the Auditorium, beginning at 11:30 o'clock a. m. The program was
as follows:</p>

<p>Mayor Harrison spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"We are here to return the thanks of Chicago for the designation of this
day in honor of their city. We represent all nationalities, all politics and all
creeds. We sometimes differ at home but we are a unit in extending to Omaha
our sympathy and encouragement and our congratulations on its magnificent
achievement. This celebration comes at a time of glorious significance to this
country. We have learned that the untried volunteers are of the stuff of
which heroes are made and that Sampson, Dewey and Schley are worthy successors to Farragut and Perry. We are not only a peace-loving nation, but we
have found that we have the ability to make our enemies on the battlefield
desire peace rather than war."</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.439.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.439.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.439.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>Referring more particularly to Chicago, Mayor Harrison said that a Chicagoan could not tell the truth about his city without being accused of exaggeration. The truth about Chicago seemed like an extravagant dream to the citizen
of New York, or Boston or Philadelphia. But Omaha can understand Chicago.
Her people have the same inherent spirit, and the same pluck and enterprise
had made each city what it is. In conclusion, he declared that not only on
this occasion, but in every achievement of its future, Omaha commands all the
sympathy and encouragement and inspiration that Chicago has to give.</p>

<p>Ex-Comptroller Dawes spoke in part as follows:</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven years ago fifty of the leading citizens of Chicago gathered
themselves in a little meeting under most distressing circumstances. Around
them, in smoking and somber ruins, lay what had been but a few days before

the magnificent city of Chicago. Their on homes had been burned over their
heads; their property of all kinds as in ashes; around them all as desolation
and cheerlessness and the future seemed as dark as the present. Some of these
men rose and spoke of the city as destroyed and lost forever. Rebuilding it
seemed to them impossible. To their minds the great Chicago, the city of
their pride and affection, as numbered among the things of the past. But
from among them rose a young man who, amidst depressing surroundings,
lifted his voice in remonstrance and in prophecy of the future. 'Chicago will
live,' said he, 'and live to be so mighty and so vast that this great fire will
be but an incident in its past. And Chicago will thus live because beyond her
there lies the giant forces, the teeming millions and the imperial area of the
it mighty West, which having before created Chicago as the necessary gateway to
the East, must recreate it under the same necessities} That speaker, now the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.440.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.440.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.440.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, has lived to see Chicago
recreated by the West, and his prophecies fulfilled to the uttermost.</p>

<p>"I have thought of no better way than by the telling of this incident to
indicate the relation of Chicago to the West.</p>

<p>"Chicago is the child of the West, dependent upon her for her prosperity
and progress—almost for her very existence—and far be it from her to belittle
the debt she owes. Willingly, freely, she acknowledges and rejoices in it.
Peopled largely by Western men, sustained largely by Western resources, she
feels the keenest and most vital interest in the West, and I believe the Great
West takes equal interest in this young giant among the cities of the world.</p>

<p>"The details of the social and commercial relations between the West and
Chicago daily grow more intimate, daily agricultural more vast—relations which may
well challenge the deepest attention of the student of economics and of American
history-can receive from me today but a passing and superficial word. From
this great section, one hundred and twenty-five passenger trains carry over
twelve thousand people, rolling daily into the depots of the city of Chicago
and an equal number of trains depart daily from Chicago for the West.</p>

<p>"During the last year twenty million bushels of western heat, one hundred
and sixteen million bushels of Western corn, one hundred and eighteen million
bushels of Western oats, and seventeen million bushels of Western rye went to or
through the great commercial gateway of Chicago. Of the forty-six million
pounds of second-class printed matter entered for the year ending June go, 1896,
at the Chicago postoffice, the authorities of the office estimate that from three-eighths to three-quarters went to the West. Taking the postoffice average of
five pieces to the pound, we find that the total annual circulation of Chicago
periodical issues in the West must be between one hundred and thirty million
and one hundred and seventy-two million copies—a circulation of most surprising and pretentious magnitude. The combined mileage of the railroads east
and West of the Missouri River, binding and knitting together the  West and
Chicago in ties of common interest, is sixty-seven thousand one hundred and
eighty miles.</p>

<p>"But no catalogue of the evidences of the intimacy and vastness of the
commercial and sociological relations of the West to Chicago can add to our
sense of their importance.</p>

<p>"The degree of contentment and prosperity experienced by the Western
people under these relations of Western cities, like Chicago and Omaha, to the
Western country, is so important as affecting our national life and progress that
these relations no command the interest and attention of the entire people of
the United States.</p>

<p>"It is generally realized that when the social problems involved in them
are solved, all the internal problems which confront our young Republic will be
solved. These people—the people of Chicago, and the rest—are not waiting
for other people or other nations to solve the great problems of today, but strong

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.441.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.441.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.441.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

in the consciousness of their competency for the task, they eagerly seek after
right solutions.</p>

<p>"The rapidity of the development of the West has in less than to generations brought them face to face with the problem of existence, under all social
conditions, from the most primitive to the most complex.</p>

<p>"What has thus happened before the eyes of one generation in the West has
consumed several hundred years even in other sections of our country, and in
Continental Europe thousands of years. Crowded into the lives of the people
of the West has been the sight of an empire builded from a wilderness. We stand
today in the midst of this magnificent Exposition—an exponent of the highest
art of the world-located in this beautiful city of Omaha with its complex
nineteenth century civilization and architecture, and are startled by the thought
that the Indian and buffalo which have been brought here as objects of curiosity
lived in their native state upon this very site less than fifty years ago.</p>

<p>"Little wonder it is that the people of the West are interested in these
relations of the Western city to the Western community. The fingers of fate
move in decades and not in centuries, setting the problems for Western humanity
to conquer.</p>

<p>"Little wonder is it that no solution seems too difficult of attainment for
those who have seen such great transformations in the West through the successful solutions of earlier problems equally grave.</p>

<p>"And no as the genius of America, at the close of a glorious war so
bravely fought by a gallant army and navy under a great and wise President,
stands upon the threshold of a dawning century and a dawning destiny, with
her face toward the fair islands of the Pacific placed by God's hand under
her guardianship, little wonder is it that these people of the West, themselves but
a short time ago the adopted children of the wilderness, should not doubt that
the path of national duty toward the new Western possessions shall again be the
path of national glory."</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF HON. JAMES R. MANN</p>

<p>Congressman Mann spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"We celebrate today. the victories of peace and peaceful pursuits. Where
a magic city and a beautiful Exposition no stand, the wild buffalo as chased we
by the savage Indian within the lifetime of many here. In the midst of this fitting
celebration of the successes of our arts of peace, while enjoying the benefits
of bounteous plenty and prosperity, it is proper to recall the history of those
events which have made these Western States an equal part of that nation which
is today the embodiment of progressive civilization and which flies the most
beautiful and beloved flag ever lighted up by the sunshine or kissed by the breeze.</p>

<p>"The little narrow fringe of settlements along the Atlantic coast has grown
into an empire which seeps across the continent and embraces the islands of
the sea.</p>

<p>"The Louisiana Purchase more than doubled the national territory. It gave
to our country the exclusive control of the mighty Mississippi and its tributaries.
It planted our possessions on the Gulf of Mexico. It acquired for us the Columbia
River and a coast line on the Pacific Ocean. It brought into our country a
region having the most fertile farming and grazing lands, as well as varied
mineral resources, to be found in the world, and yet its acquirement was, as it
were, only a chance shot.</p>

<p>"Spain owned the entire Western bank of the Mississippi River, and the
eastern bank below the thirty-first parallel of latitude, the boundary line fixed
by the treaty of 1795. After the war of the
Revolution our country West of the Alleghenies
had begun to fill up with a class of sturdy and
independent pioneer settlers. These settlements
depended for transportation of their products
holly upon river navigation, the only outlet for
which as through the mouth of the Mississippi,
owned and controlled by Spain.</p>

<p>"In 1800, by the secret treaty of San Eldefonso, Spain retroceded the province of Louisiana
to France, but without delivering possession at
that time. It became evident to the statesmen of
that time that we could have no lasting peace until
we should possess one bank entire of the Mississippi River, with a consequent right to its free

navigation.</p>

<p>"Jefferson was President, and did not believe that the constitution warranted
the purchase of new territory, but overcoming his scruples he rose equal to the
emergency and he commissioned James Monroe to act with Robert Livingston,
then Minister to France,'in an effort to purchase that part of the Louisiana
province east of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, and Congress appropriated the sum of two million dollars for that purpose.</p>

<p>"It is an will agricultural that blows nobody any good.' Fortunately, for our on
interests, France and England were then on the verge of another war. They
had just concluded a treaty of peace, but each country as looking with dread
suspicion upon the other. England viewed with grave suspicion the retransfer
by Spain of the immense Louisiana province to France; and Napoleon, who
was then the first Consul of France and its ruler, quickly sa that in case of war
the English, with their superiority at sea, would immediately seize Ne Orleans
and the Mississippi River Valley. On Easter Sunday, April 10, 1803, he called
to of his counselors who were most familiar with the foreign possessions and
asked their advice. He said to them: 'l know the full value of Louisiana, and

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.443.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.443.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.443.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

I have been desirous of repairing the fault of the French negotiator who
abandoned it in 1763. A few lines of a treaty have restored it to me, and I have
scarcely recovered it when I must expect to lose it. But if it escapes me, it
shall one day cost dearer to those who oblige me to strip myself of it, than to
those to whom I wish to deliver it. The English have successively taken from
France Canada, Cape Breton, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and the richest portions of Asia. They shall not have the Mississippi, which they covet.'</p>

<p>"After hearing from his advisers, one in favor of selling the province to
the United States, the other in favor of retaining it, Napoleon said: 'Irresolution 
and deliberation are no longer in season; I renounce Louisiana. It is not only
Ne Orleans that I will cede; it is the hole colony without any reservation.'</p>

<p>"Monroe and Livingston had no authority to accept the offer which as
made to them by Napoleon. They could not cable for instructions. They had
no time to communicate with the home Government by letter. Napoleon as
not a Spanish diplomat; he anted his offer promptly accepted or rejected.</p>

<p>"Monroe and Livingston, however, proved equal to the occasion, and after
negotiations, which lasted for a few days, the purchase as agreed upon, the
United States to pay France a principal sum of eleven million to hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, payable in stocks or bonds due in fifteen years, with interest, and the further sum of three million seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars to be paid by our Government to American citizens having certain valid claims against France.</p>

<p>"When the treaty became known in this country, some of the haters of
President Jefferson raised a violent outcry against its confirmation, and dire
predictions were made about the danger of extending the country in violation
of the constitution, and burdening the people with an immense debt for the
purpose of buying an uninhabitable wilderness.</p>

<p>"The treaty of purchase as.dated April 30, 1803, as ratified in October
following, and on December 20, 1803, the American flag as raised over New
Orleans. No one can measure the future possibilities of these States embraced
in the Louisiana Purchase. The development since the purchase in 1803 has
been more splendid than an alchemist's dream. The future will far outrival the present and the past.</p>

<p>"The value of the Louisiana Purchase can not yet be appreciated. In 1854
Omaha as but a bare trading post. Its growth has been as rapid as the mushroom which springs up in the night, but as strong and certain as the steel beams
which constitute the superstructure of its great buildings, and is but an example of the genius of the West.</p>

<p>"The acquisition of the Louisiana Territory as the greatest prize ever gained by a nation at one time. By the stroke of a pen an empire changed hands. In a moment of doubt a construction as placed upon the constitution which
authorized the vast increase of territory.</p>

<p>"The Louisiana Purchase will soon have a greater population than the
country which sold it to us. A single false step might have lost us this

possession. All the circumstances at the time of its purchase conspired to give
us a single opportunity to gain an empire. The opportunity refused or neglected
might never have come again.</p>

<p>"The France which today maintains an army of more than half a million
men because she as compelled to cede Alsace and Lorraine to Germany, gave
away to us a possession many times Alsace and Lorraine, and gave it in friendly
peace.</p>

<p>"Not one of us can look far into the future. The progress of a century
has enabled us to utilize all our possessions. The lightning's fluid puts far distant territory in a moment's communication with the capital. The expansion of
our domain and the increase of our possessions made more keen the genius and
intellect of our people. It broadened the heart and deepened the souls of our
citizens. with the new ants, caused by long distance and varied interests,
came new ideas with which to supply those ants. Ne discoveries in the fields
of science, art, mechanics, follow closely the new discoveries regarding the surface of our territory."</p>

<p>A banquet as served to the prominent guests in the Markel Café immediately after the exercises, and a special sham battle as given in the afternoon
for their entertainment, followed by a reception in the evening at the Illinois
building, here many prominent citizens of Omaha gathered to pay their respects
to the honored visitors.</p>

<p>LIVE-STOCK DAY—October 3, 1898</p>

<p>As one of the great attractions of the Exposition, a live-stock show had
been planned which should equal or excel any such display that had ever been
made. Premiums to the amount of thirty-five thousand dollars had been voted
by the Board of Directors. Nearly twenty acres of ground had been covered by
buildings and stalls, herein nearly three thousand animals were displayed, and
on this day the Live-stock Exhibit as opened to the inspection of the world. No
formal exercises marked the beginning of this great exhibition, but thousands
of live-stock men from all over the West swelled the attendance, and great interest
as aroused by the magnificent display which awaited their inspection. This
live-stock exhibit proved a very instructive and interesting feature of the Exposition, and as pronounced one of its most successful exhibits.</p>

<p>PENNSYLVANIA DAY—October 5, 1898</p>

<p>Numerous representatives of trade organizations, members of the Pennsylvania Commission, and prominent citizens of Pennsylvania, including the Honorable Charles Emory Smith, of Philadelphia, Postmaster-General of the United States, came to celebrate their day at the Exposition.</p>

<p>A public reception, as tendered Postmaster-General Smith by Honorable
Edward Rosewater at the Bee building, on the evening of October 4. At this

reception, many of the prominent citizens of Omaha and visitors from all parts
of the West paid their respects to the representatives of the Government. Music
as furnished, and short addresses were made.</p>

<p>The exercises for Pennsylvania Day were held at the Auditorium at 2:30
o'clock p. m., and consisted of the following program:</p>

<span class="lg program">
<span class="l">Music .......................................................................... Innes Band</span>
<span class="l">Address of Welcome .............................................. Gen. Charles F. Manderson</span>
<span class="l">Response .............................. Hon. John Woodside, Chairman Pennsylvania Commission</span>
<span class="l">Music .......................................................................... Innes Band</span>
<span class="l">Oration ........................ Hon. Charles Emory Smith, Postmaster-General United States</span></span>

<p>Postmaster-General Smith spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"This is Pennsylvania Day. It is dedicated to the friendly interests of the
great commonwealth of the East in this splendid monument of the energy and
public spirit of the West. Philadelphia is the mother of American expositions.
She has seen with pride how the Centennial of 1876 has been followed by a series
of brilliant exhibitions and she has encouraged and supported them with the
same patriotic zeal which prompted her on pioneer effort. She is here today
through her representatives to congratulate you on this stately and impressive
creation, on these dazzling scenes of beauty and
activity, which typify the artistic achievements and
the industrial progress of this mighty Trans-Mississippi region. Pennsylvania feels another
interest in this imposing exhibition. To the sturdy,
enlightened and enterprising citizenship which has
created this noble commonwealth she has contributed an honorable share; her blood flows in the

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

</div>

veins of this vigorous offspring of the adventurous
spirit and thrift of the older sections. Her children
are among the pillars of your State. One of her
sons as for years your distinguished and honored
Senator, and still adorns and illuminates your civic
life. Pennsylvania blends in high degree the composite racial elements and the fruitful heritage of
ancestral diversity which have enriched and
strengthened the American people; and steadfast, stable and solid as she is,
firm as the keystone of the arch she symbolizes, she has none the less joined
in the onward march and infused something of her on characteristics in the
upbuilding of this great Empire of the West. We have moved during the last
six months in the sift current of stupendous events which have recast the maps
and spanned the hole horizon. We have just emerged triumphant from a short
but crucial and momentous war, which has carried forward history and unveiled
destiny. The halo it has shed on American arms, and the glory with which it has
exalted the American name, fill us with just pride and exaltation. Reluctantly

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.446.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.446.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.446.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

accepted by the President only under the supreme mandate of humanity and justice, yet once undertaken, the unerring seriousness of its aim, the unfaltering
vigor of its direction and the unbroken seep of its success, stand
unmatched on the pages of war. The renown of the American navy, always
brilliant, and never equaled, man for man and gun for gun, as sustained
and enhanced in every clash, of the struggle. An army of to hundred and fifty
thousand men as summoned from the ranks of citizenship, organized, equipped
and made ready for action. Every soldier who fought as transported beyond
the deep. The hole scene of the war as on foreign soil and in a tropical
clime, under burning skies and drenching torrents, with the blight of fever and
the danger of pestilence. In the face of such difficulties, what a sift and
unerring triumph!</p>

<p>"With our monumental victory, we face a new epoch in the history of the
republic. We come into a broader outlook, whose deep import it is well for us
to consider. The world knows our ampler reach and our larger destiny and we
feel it. No true American can be insensible to the increased respect for our
country and the higher conception of its mission which the marvelous revelations
of this war have inspired in all lands. The embattled farmers at Lexington
'fired the shot heard around the world,' and not less distinctly and significantly
did the opening shot of this war under the glittering constellations of the Orient
resound in every capital of the globe and awaken a new understanding of
America's onward movement.</p>

<p>"It is recognized that the United States advances to its place as one of the
great world powers, and whatever may be our wise policy, whatever may be
the measure of our just restraint or our legitimate condition, no American can
fail to feel an honorable pride in the new distinction and the new consideration
never before approached, which American heroism and American statesmanship
have brought to our republic. The World's acknowledged tribute is the measure
of its estimate of the potency of our new position. Our use of that position will
be the measure of our wisdom and rulership. Equal to every crisis in the past,
we shall deal with this emergency in the true American spirit. It makes us
responsible for Cuba. It gives us Porto Rico. It plants our outposts on the
by further side of the globe. whatever we hold, whether it be more or less, will be
held, not for territorial aggrandizement, but solely in acceptance of responsibilities
which Providence has laid upon us. Men like to talk of 'imiperialism.' Our
imperialism is not territorial lust, but benignant trade expansion and civilizing
influence, and our flag is at Manila, not in any spirit of spoliation, not in either
the greed or the glory of conquest, but, let it be reverently said, under the controlling force of a Deity or of a providential guidance, at the ripe hour in the
development and requirements of our national growth.</p>

<p>"It is treated in many quarters simply as a question of territorial expansion,
but that is a secondary and incidental consideration. The great and overshadowing question is one of commercial openings. The heart of the issue is
not mere territory, but trade, necessities and facilities. Beyond and behind and

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.447.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.447.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.447.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

beneath this departure lies the broad problem of America's destiny in the commerce and civilization of the world. If we are to fulfill that destiny we must
have commercial expansion, and it is a profoundly significant fact which shows
a guiding hand that overrules the will of man that this war should have come
just as this great necessity begins to be realized. The opportunity matches the
need.</p>

<p>"The universal acceptance of its obligation to stretch forth its civilizing
hand here the fate of war has carried it, a fortunate possession of an established
emporium on the very theater of the World's seeking, have brought the occasion
and the duty together. Is it not for enlightened American statesmanship, watchful of American interests, to use the opportunity, not in territorial avarice, but for
commercial extension and civilizing influence in the,Orient with the base and
bulwark that are needed for its support? Shall we be worthy of this high
mission? I have full faith in my countrymen. I believe in the spirit and capacity
of the American people. This war and its tremendous question has given us a
new elevation and dignity and purpose. Ho it has dwarfed and diminished
our domestic differences and our petty contentions! Ho it has kindled the
patriotic fire and quickened the true national instinct! Ho it has lifted us to
a higher plane of public consciousness and to a broader vie of national greatness! In the large work before us of governing and developing our new
possessions, of ameliorating and advancing the condition of the new people who
have been brought under the protecting folds of our flag, and of achieving the
fullness of the possibilities within our grasp, there is call for all that is best in
our American courage and statesmanship and character.</p>

<p>"There is call for thoughtful, conscientious and patriotic devotion on the
part of the people. Dealing with these great questions which the future of our
country and its relations to the world make necessary calls for no narrow
partisanship. Let us leave our partisanship to domestic issues; let us limit our
family contests to the family circle; let us with patriotic spirit end them at our
on shores, and when we come to confront foreign countries and nations involving our honor, our dignity and our interests before the world, let us stand united
as one people, forgetting that we are republicans and democrats and remembering
only that we are all Americans together.</p>

<p>"With single purpose and with unerring wisdom our Executive has called
his aides and associates in the great work from all parties and all sections, and
through all the conflicts and all the settlement his sole thought has been the welfare and glory of his country. It is for the American people to meet these
new questions in the same lofty spirit of patriotism, with open eyes for the
broader career before us and open hands for the higher duty and destiny of the
republic.</p>

<p>OHIO DAY—October 7, 1898</p>

<p>The Governor of Ohio, with his staff and numerous representative citizens
A from the Buckeye State, were met at the Paxton Hotel by the Secretary of the
Ohio State Commission, President Wattles and
members of the Bureau of Entertainment, and 
conveyed in carriages to the Exposition grounds.
The line of carriages as preceded by the Toledo Marine Band.</p>

<p>The exercises at the Auditorium took place at
eleven o'clock a. m., and consisted of the following program:</p>

<span class="lg program">
<span class="l">Music ................................. Toledo Marine Band</span>
<span class="l">Address of Welcome .................... Governor Silas A, Holcomb</span>
<span class="l">Response .............................. Governor Asa S. Bushnell</span>
<span class="l">Music ................................. Toledo Marine Band</span>
<span class="l">Address ............................... Hon, John L. Webster</span>
<span class="l">Address ............................... Col. James Kilbourne</span>
<span class="l">Address ............................... Mayor Jones, of Toledo</span></span>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Daniel W. Jones, Mayor of Toledo</p>
 
</div>

<p>Governor Bushnell spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen: It affords me heartfelt gratification to respond, on behalf of the State of Ohio, to the generous words of welcome
that have been uttered by the representative of this great State and great undertaking and charming city, to those who have come to witness and participate
in the honors to be paid the State and the people, of whom we are so proud.</p>

<p>"It seems to me, your Excellency, that you have gathered welcomes from
the hearts of all your people and have tossed them from your lips over this
beautiful audience and I can assure you they will abide with us as sweet forget-me-nots of the occasion and of our visit here, and your words of welcome
will be agricultural memories to us as they come floating down into our hearts with
thoughts of love, of home and country.</p>

<p>"Ohio rejoices in this exploitation of the marvelous development of the
Trans-Mississippi States. Ohio applauds the energy and enterprise, the ability
and zeal, the courage and consummate skill which has given to our nation and
to the world this splendid manifestation of the triumphs of civilization during
hardly half a century of progress. Ohio recognizes the distinction given when
the Trans-Mississippi States in their great Exposition program set apart this
time for the people of an admiring and loyal sister State to pay their tribute of
respect and their homage for a deed well done. No praise or homage can be
more sincere than ours; we realize the significance and the intent of this vast
and magnificent demonstration in glory of this rich domain and its people; we
are mindful of the righteous claim you have to the approbation of all who love
advancement in the affairs of men.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.449.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.449.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.449.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"The great West and Ohio are indeed bound by a fraternal chain; a common ancestry unites many of our respective people, and the States have progressed along the same lines. The enormous expanse West of the Mississippi teems with Ohioans, or the sons and daughters of Ohioans. No arm has been
more potent in the redemption of that which as a vast wilderness than that of
Ohio. Her colonists have only stopped at the Pacific, and I am no told that
much Ohio enterprise is manifest in Japan and the far East. I know that you
will not resent this claim of ours to some of the credit that is due for the
achievements no before the eyes of all men. The first settlers of our State,
whether from old Connecticut, or old Virginia, were conscientious people, who
brought with them not only industry and perseverance, but also those religious
principles which go so far to stamp the history of a State.</p>

<span class="lg poem">
<span class="l">"Fresh from the Revolution's fire,</span>
<span class="l">They came to the the empire's way,</span>
<span class="l">Through trackless wastes, and to inspire</span>
<span class="l">The sunlight of young freedom's day.</span></span>

<p>"They founded a peerless State, and not content with such an achievement as Ohio, some of these pioneers and their children straightway kept up the noble work and carved four more great States out of the Northwest territory. The example thus set by Ohio's pioneers has, I verily believe, been imitated persistently down to this day. Her children are to be found everywhere in this matchless agricultural area. They are of sturdy stock and I know I voice the sentiments of all when I say that their adopted States have profited by their coming and by their staying. There is an Ohio colony in this State, and an Ohio Society of this city. Like its distinguished sister organization of the city of New York, it is composed of strong men—those who have made their mark in the business and professional world and who enjoy the esteem and confidence of their fellowmen. It is, I assure you, a great pleasure to all of us who come from the land of their birth, to know that these former Ohioans have had an active part not only in this work, but in much that has preceded it.</p>

<p>"I beg of you to believe that this laudation of Ohio and Ohioans is only
inspired by my desire to obtain some credit for agency in this grand work by
which you put before all the world a plain and truthful, yet glorious, exhibit
of the wonderful fertility of your land, the strength of your industries, and the ability of your people. Surely, in such a cause, one can lay stress upon any fact or theory which will enable the claim that some of the virtue is owing to your kindred.</p>

<p>"Speaking of myself, and yet, as I well know, showing the innermost
thought of many of the Ohioans who are here with us today, I must say that
I can not express the wonder of my mind when dwelling upon the history of
this Indian country of old and its present-day development. In approaching
such a subject one must, in a measure, feel some awe. It is more like the work
of an Aladdin, or a magician who, with his wand, transforms the crude into the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.450.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.450.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.450.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

finished product, or from the rough material makes a splendid creation. when
Ohio, in the dignity of a youthful State, as pluming herself upon her Constitution, upon her representatives in Congress, and upon her Government, the
great region of which in this year Omaha is no the central point as a portion of the District of Louisiana. when much of the history of our State had been written this as known as the Indian country; when Ohio as plunged into the dissensions that sometimes come with a supposed state of civilization, these were but territories. It is hard to realize, and yet we all know that it is true.</p>

<p>"Not long ago, in a convenient little book which seems to have been written
for the especial benefit of Governors of States, I came across some paragraphs
expressing opinions of those who can not be called people of very remote age
and relating to this very district. I can not forbear to quote a few of these as they seem to furnish the best means of introducing the standard by which the
Trans-Mississippi States are to be judged today. That is, they show how little
man knows of the future and who vain are his theories when dealing with
mighty nature. Let me quote now:</p>

<p>"In his Universal Geography, Kedediah Morse remarked that 'It has been 
supposed that all settlers who go beyond the Mississippi River will be forever
lost to the United States.' Lieutenant Pike reported to the war Department,
that 'From these immense prairies may be derived one great advantage to the
United States; namely, the restriction of our population to some certain limits,
and thereby a continuation of the Union. They will be constrained to limit
their extent to the West, to the borders of the Missouri and Mississippi, while
they leave the prairies, incapable of cultivation, to the wandering and uncivilized
aborigines of the country.' Major Long reported that this region bore 'a
manifest resemblance to the deserts of Siberia.' <em class="hi">The Edinburg Review</em> said: 'There lies the desert, except in a few spots on the borders of the rivers, incapable, probably forever, of fixed settlements.' The <em class="hi">North American Review</em> (in 1858) said: 'The people of the United States have reached their inland western frontier, and the banks of the Missouri River are the shores at the termination of a vast ocean desert over 1,000 miles in breadth, which it is proposed to travel, if at all, with caravans of camels, and which interpose a final barrier to the establishment of large communications, agricultural, commercial, or even pastoral.'</p>

<p>"And I can add to these remarks the suggestion which I think will be
we borne out by the Congressional Record, that it as the great and wise and
eloquent Daniel Webster, who, in a speech opposing the institution of a wagon
road across the plains, said that no good would ever come out of the region;
that it as incapable of civilization or cultivation. These, I know, are not the
precise words, but I believe the effect has been rendered faithfully.</p>

<p>"You all know, in a general way, what a startling transformation has
ensued in the Trans-Mississippi country, for I do not limit the impractical line
of old to the Missouri River. It as all the same to these deluded men, how

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.451.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.451.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.451.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

saw nothing in the rich prairie country. At the risk of repeating facts and
figures, which may be well understood by the citizens of this region, and
which may, therefore, be trite observations, I wish to put before your minds
some statements which will give a truer conception of the immensity of the
change. I will leave unspoken all reference to your manufacturing, to your
commerce, and to trade in general, and will deal only with that portion of the
general subject which concerns the true foundation stone of tour national
prosperity—I mean agriculture. And even in agriculture I must limit the scope, for in this country it becomes too broad for ordinary discussion. I find, according to the reports of the United States Department of Agriculture, that in 1896 your States of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota—which we commonly call the Trans-Mississippi States, when considering them in an agricultural sense—had an acreage of corn, heat and oats under cultivation which was very nearly thirty-eight per cent of the hole acreage of the United States, devoted to such purposes, Furthermore, I find that upon this acreage in the Trans-Mississippi States I have named, there as produced a combined crop, which as over forty per cent of the whole of such production in the Union. And, again, as I have figured it, I discovered that this crop represented very nearly twenty per cent of the total value of such production in the Union. The figures run into stupendous amounts and are almost beyond comprehension. The wealth of Golconda could hardly have been considered in connection with such financial results as these broad prairies produced what feeble efforts are those of the mining regions of the world, when one considers them in comparison with the wealth of the cereals of these States. Again, the thought comes, how little do we know the possibilities of the soil, or the resources of man. To the north of us a thousand miles from here lies the territory of our neighbor, the Dominion of Canada. But a few years ago it as supposed that the vast expanse north of, the divisional line as practically unfit for serious effort in the way of agriculture. And yet the work is going bravely on with great returns. It is no very nearly to the Athabasca River, and who knows how much farther north it may go in the future. Even climatic conditions may not be able to stop the march of progress and of civilization. We must not forget that the men who pronounced this region as valueless to the white man looked only through the spectacles of the period.</p>

<p>"I can not express the degree of praise I feel for those who have accomplished the mighty and marvelous task of making this region one of the garden spots of the world. Even if nature as kindly in her response to the zeal and energy of the husbandman, there were yet tremendous difficulties to be overcome.

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.452.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.452.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.452.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

The comfort and the luxury that no surrounds many of your citizens are only indicative of bounteous nature and hard work. There are many still who are in the throes of the beginning, but I have every confidence that the result will be the same in all cases here equal conscientious endeavor marks the effort. This Exposition speaks well for every industry of your region; it typifies, as no other monument or enterprise reared by human hands could, the virtues of your aims and purposes, and the success which has crowned your efforts. It is wonderful to see, and yet it teaches a lesson plain to all men. It is the result of the American character and, therefore, we all can share in the just pride.</p>

<p>"My countrymen, can any of us, thinking not in a vain-glorious, but in a
truly appreciative and patriotic way, form any proper conception of the strength and power, the ability and the resourcefulness, of our great nation? Students of all records of man have acknowledged that the American result—the direct product of the Anglo-Saxon race—has no parallel, and we have become accustomed to the praise and wonder and, perhaps, the envy of the older nations, as such have been expressed from time to time. Would that we ourselves could be able to reach some just estimate. Not that it might be used in self-laudation, which is ever unbecoming, but that all should know how great our gratitude to God should be, and how much we should value the work of our fellowmen in this blessed land. The history of America is replete with the stories which tell the triumphs of our people over obstacles. Had any other illustration or incident been needed it as supplied this year when the nation, busy as it as, with its on affairs, and vast interests, espoused a good cause and astonished the world by an exhibition of quick transformation from a state of peace to that  of war. The result, as is usual with us, has been significant and valuable. Another side of the all-conquering American nature has been shown, and again the world is wondering for the next development. It has seemed strange to those abroad that with such momentous matters in hand, the nation should be able to continue business without serious interruption or effort, and that, among other evidences of unconcern, the people could take an active part in such an affair as this, which is always supposed to be an incident of peace. We can be proud of our country, but, my fellow-citizens, even we can not understand her. As well might the average man attempt to estimate the force and power of a cataract as to reach a true realization of the colossal resources and the marvelous conditions of our republic. This creation before us is but one exhibit-one demonstration of the power that lies behind. It is a striking example and a finished product, but even its human authors, despite their hard labor, will admit that it but represents one of the fingers of the deft and mighty hands of a nation which, under the guidance of a Divine Providence, seems destined to act for the good and the teaching of the world in the future as it has done in the past.</p>

<p>"The view we have had, and will have, today, of the achievements exhibited
by this great Exposition, can not but move us to the spirit of emulation. Not
in a boasting spirit, nor that of rivalry, but in that of fraternity, let me say

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.453.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.453.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.453.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

that Ohio can and must do as well at a later date. Ohio, when her century of
time shall have come, must send her greeting and her bidding to this progressive 
people that they may journey westward, even as we have come westard, to ownership at another shrine of progress and development. Five years hence, Ohio
will have her centennial, at the beautiful city of Toledo, the metropolis of our
State's northwest, whose face is bathed by the waters of the River Maumee, and
her feet by the restless waves of Lake Erie—ever coming and going. A multitude of her enterprising citizens from all walks of life are no here to second
the invitation I extend you, and to anticipate the assurance of the welcome to 
you all by some future Governor of the State. Come to us, then, as we have
come to you today, with hearts selling with pride and joy that such a spectacle
and an occasion as this can be, with generous thoughts and words of kindness
and good will, with willing eyes, to see the triumphs you have achieved, and
with ready hands to help lead the way to still higher paths of honor for all our
people.</p>

<p>"In closing, let me say that Ohio has exulted in this opportunity to do
even a small part toward making this undertaking the glowing success it has
proven to be. It is our hope that the bond between the States may grow stronger
year by year by reason of this closer communion. Cordially and heartily we
accept and treasure the assurances of amity that have been spoken. As earnestly
and sincerely do we repeat the pledges for our part. I congratulate you all
upon the result of your labors and wish you unbounded success and the utmost
realization of your hopes in every way.</p>

<p>"May your States, strong as they are in the elements that go so far to
place commonwealths in the front in the never ending race for renown and
reward, gain still greater fame. May they in the years to come feel that there
has been the same steady advance and the same virility and power which made
possible the remarkable results which are crystalized in the Exposition that lies
before us today."</p>

<p>NEW YORK DAY—October 8, 1898</p>

<p>A special train conveyed the members of the New York State Commission,
together with the representatives of the Produce Exchange and other organizations of New York City and State, with prominent railway officials and their guests from New York to Omaha, arriving on the evening of October 7. The
guests were met on their arrival by General Manager Clarkson, and other
Exposition officials, who conveyed to them the invitation of the Board of Governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben to attend the grand Carnival Ball at the
Coliseum on that evening. Although the guests were weary with their long
journey, many of them accepted this invitation.</p>

<p>Among the prominent guests who came were the Honorable Chauncey M.
Depew, S. R. Callaway, President of the New York Central Railroad; ex-Senator Warner Miller, H. B. Herbert, of the Produce Exchange; Dr. Steward Webb,

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.454.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.454.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.454.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Marvin Hughitt, and others. Carriages were provided, and many of these
prominent guests were escorted to the Carnival Ball by Exposition officials.
The scene of beauty and brilliancy which met their gaze as they entered the
Coliseum caused many exclamations of pleasure and surprise. Mr. Depew
pronounced the ball equal in all its appointments to any he had ever witnessed,
and he derived much pleasure from meeting many of the beautiful ladies and
prominent men that were in attendance.</p>

<p>Carriages conveyed the visitors from their hotels to the Exposition grounds
on the morning of New York Day, and the exercises were held in the Auditorium
at eleven o'clock, a. m., and consisted of the following program:</p>

<span class="lg program">
<span class="l">Music ........................................................................ Innes Band</span>
<span class="l">Secretary of New York Commission Jacob Amos, Jr., introduced ex-Senator Warner
Miller, who made a brief address.</span>
<span class="l">Address ............................................................... President Wattles</span>

<span class="l">Oration ........................................................... Hon. Chauncey M. Depew</span>
<span class="l">Music ........................................................................ Innes Band</span></span>

<p>President Wattles spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"With the distinguished orator, whose name and fame are known throughout the civilized world, to follow, and whom you are impatient to hear, more
than a few formal words of welcome from me would be untimely.</p>

<p>"The pleasure of welcoming to this Exposition the representative men of
the great State of New York, here present, is increased by the fact that it is the
State of my nativity, and by the additional fact that it is the only Eastern State
represented by a building on these grounds. The wealth, intelligence and enterprise of its citizens are illustrated in nearly every exhibit building here, and
while this is primarily a Western Exposition, the progressive business organizations, the State officials and members of the Assembly were quick to improve
the opportunity of advancing the interests of the State by patronizing a worthy
enterprise, promoted in a country from which New York State and its great
metropolis derive no small part of their commerce. For the management of
this Exposition, I desire to express our appreciation of this recognition and
assistance. Your building here has been a convenient home for thousands of
former residents of your State, who now live in the West. Old acquaintances
have been revived and new friendships formed, and by the efficient services of
the Secretary of your Commission the people of the West will have many
pleasant recollections of the hospitalities this home has afforded.</p>

<p>"One of the principal objects of the promoters of this Exposition as to
bring together in closer communion the diversified interests of the people of our
common country. Forty years ago a sentiment grew and expanded that the
interests of the North and of the South were not identical. This sectional strife
finally culminated in the greatest internal war of the age. As we no look back

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.455.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.455.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.455.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

and calmly consider the causes of this war, we are led to believe it might have
been avoided, and its horrors averted by a more perfect understanding between
the people of the sections involved. In later years the sentiment has been
expressed in heated political discussion that the interests of the Eastern States, and especially of New York, are antagonistic and at enmity with the commercial  and political interests of the West. Happily, the recent contest with a foreign foe has united all parts of our common country and has taught the lesson that its destiny must not be dimmed by internal strife. When Rough Riders of the West, under the gallant leadership of that matchless commander from the East, fought and fell in defense of humanity and our country's flag, and on a brilliant victory over a foreign enemy, to most important lessons were learned: first, that the intelligent and well-directed volunteer citizen-soldiers of our nation are unconquerable, and, second, that all our citizens are of the same blood and endowed with the same patriotic instincts, whether they come from the plains of the West of the millionaire homes of the East.

"We celebrate today the history and progress of the greatest States, in wealth, commerce and population, of our Union. We, of her nativity, look with pride on the galaxy of great names which adorn her history. In statesmanship, war, theology, literature, jurisprudence, invention, oratory and finance her sons have on lasting fame. Her great metropolis is the commercial center of the Western Continent. Through its business channels pulsates the commerce of an empire. Many of the great transportation lines, which have peopled the Trans-Mississippi country with twenty million inhabitants in the past fifty years, are the product of the brain and the money of its financiers, and to their genius and daring we are indebted for much of the magnificence, progress and prosperity illustrated in these palaces of art and science, which picture a growth and development which has been unparalleled in history.</p>

<p>We, who early emigrated from Eastern States and experienced for a time
the privations cf pioneer life, can fully appreciate the changes wrought since the first whistle of the locomotive on the Western prairies as heard. Fifty years ago the ground on which this building stands was as yet public domain, unsurveyed and unoccupied save by Indian tribes. Since then eighty thousand miles of railway have been constructed West of the Mississippi River. Great cities have been built and a commerce double that of Spain and Portugal evolved by a people gathered from all parts of the world, These transportation lines have

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.456.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.456.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.456.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

given value to the products of the farm, to the labor of the workshop, and have
brought to our doors the conveniences and comforts of life, and we most accord
due credit and fair legislation to the great men who have provided the means
and the genius of affairs to make habitable these rich prairies of the West.</p>

<p>"The country which this Exposition represents will forever be the granary
of the nation. with an increase of production in the next quarter of a century
equal to that of the past, it would supply the necessities of life for the inhabitants of the world. With the increase of population and wealth and the higher civilization which will come to this country within the lives of many here present today, the great commerce of the metropolis of the nation must grow and expand, and picture and prophesy for the State, whose history and progress we celebrate today, a future as grand as its past has been important in moulding the destiny and controlling the affairs of what is to be the wealthiest, most attractive and progressive nation in the world.</p>

<p>"New territory has been added to our national domains by the brilliant victories of our recent war. The necessity of a ship canal, which shall connect if the Atlantic with the Pacific, has been fully demonstrated by recent events. The commerce of our country must expand, and a part of the trade of the Orient
must be secured. No nation can grow rich and great by communicating only
with its on people, and we must look to the men of our metropolis for leadership in extending our commerce and increasing our influence with foreign countries.</p>

<p>"The greatness and power of our nation has within the past six months
been demonstrated as never before. Within one hundred days, and with victories
unsurpassed in history, we defeated at arms one of the oldest kingdoms of the
world. At the same time there has been maintained here in the center of our
territory an Exposition for the education and elevation of our people. We
have gathered here many distinguished men from all parts of the country, but
with none are the interests and destiny of the West more closely allied than with the representatives of the great State of New York here today. To you, one
and all, I present the best wishes of our people. That our relations, both business and social, may be increased by this friendly visit, is my earnest wish."</p>

<p>The speaker introduced Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, orator of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Depew spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen: Some years ago, Chicago, the metropolis of the
West, itself the most marvelous of the creations of the latter half of this wonderful century, reared upon the borders of Lake Michigan an industrial city.
The spirits, whose deeds in classic and eastern tale charmed our childhood,
became commonplace mortals. American genius and modern science surpassed
in suggestion and execution the works of demi-gods and genii. The stately
palaces, broad avenues, lakes and canals of this home of industry and the arts,
drew all the world within its walls. In its conception and administration, the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.457.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.457.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.457.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

World's Fair at Chicago as a worthy celebration of the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus, and a fitting tribute to the great explorer.</p>

<p>"Our industrial progress has been, during the four years since the Chicago
exposition, greater than during any decade in our history. Our resources have
been developed, our markets enlarged, and new avenues of employment opened.
we have, in greater measure than ever before, realized our dream of producing
in our on country everything required for necessities or luxuries. From practical independence of other countries for the products of their fields or factories, we have suddenly become their competitors with our surplus both within and without their borders.</p>

<p>"The great benefits which the World's Fair at Chicago conferred upon
the United States in acquisition from foreign countries and information to
foreign Governments, this Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha is vastly to

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>

</div>

enhance in bringing nearer together in better understanding of each other the different sections of our own country. I heard Li Hung Chang say, when here, that there were many provinces in China, and many Chinamen, who had not heard of the war with Japan. The light of the nineteenth century had not penetrated China's iron-clad isolation. A conflict in which her territory was invaded, her fleet destroyed, her cities, captured, tens of thousands of her people killed, and lands and islands she had held for centuries wrested from her could be carried and ended while a large part of her people were peacefully pursuing their vocations, ignorant of these disasters to their county. This Exposition has increased in industrial interest during every hour of our war with Spain, and yet every pulsation of its activities and every throb of the hearts of its visitors have been moved with patriotic prayers for the success of our arms and intelligent understanding of the justice of our cause. We have carried on a war with a foreign country, raised and equipped an army of two hundred and fifty thousand men, and a formidable navy, have on great victories by sea and land, and yet, though our interests and industries are so intimately connected that a blow in any section of the country is felt everywhere, this Exposition has as serenely continued its course as it has enthusiastically celebrated the deeds of Dewey, Sampson, Schley and Hobson and Miles, Shafter and Merritt. There could be no happier illustration of the boundless resources of the United States and its powers for peace and war. It demonstrates the versatility of the Yankee character, and its adaptability to circumstances. One thing at a time has had its day, and no longer forms a headline of the copy-book of the American boy. Spain

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.458.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.458.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.458.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

is so thoroughly thrashed with one hand while the other attends with energy and
efficiency to the business of the nation.</p>

<p>"New York has been too content with being the Empire State, and with
having its chief city the metropolis of the continent, the West too eager for
empire independent of the East, the South living too much upon its traditions
and in its past, the Pacific slope resting too serenely upon its boundless possibilities and great expectations. The war with Spain has superbly restored the sentiment of nationality and eliminated sectional jealousies. But this Exposition is a healthy educator for commercial union. The mission of peace is to develop the practical side of patriotism. It is to teach and demonstrate what will promote the development of the hole country and the prosperity and
happiness of the hole people.</p>

<p>"The concentrated capital of the East is the fruit of three hundred years
of settlement and trade. It is needed in the West for railroads, irrigation,
mines, Water-power, furnaces and mills. It furnishes the transportation facilities which transform the prairie from the grazing plains of the buffalo and the hunting ground of the wolf, to the farm, the homestead and productive power in herds of cattle and vast fields of corn and heat. Its hopeful enterprise often finds for it an untimely grave in booming tons, unnecessary railroads and worthless mines. But capital is both selfish and intelligent. It never deserts a territory because the investment has failed through bad judgment. It seeks other sources for profitable employment and finds its remuneration in other and needed work for the development of the country. Its free-masonry of fear is confined by no boundaries of land or sea. In times and in places of panic and distrust, it disappears and increases the distress. with the return of confidence it moves the machinery of society and makes possible varied industries and prosperity. The State which so legislates as to take away all earning power from the money it has invited or borrowed, soon learns that it has gained a temporary advantage and lost its credit, which is the most fruitful source of profit and prosperity. Difference between the East and the West have been due to distance, misunderstanding and demagogues. For a time the sections were daily becoming more widely separated. The West as encouraged to
believe that it as plundered by usurers and extortionists in the East, and the
East learned to distrust the integrity and intentions of the, West. Far-sighted
citizens of the prairie and mountain States knew that the resources of this wide territory had scarcely been touched. Drouth can be defeated by the ditch. Millions of acres from which the homesteader has fled in despair, and millions more known as the Great American Desert, are to become, through storage reservoirs and irrigation, fruitful farms, thriving settlements and happy homes.</p>

<p>"Education is the remedy for our troubles. The school is the preparatory
department of the college, and the college fits boys for the greater universities of the world. The school and the college teach, they can not educate. The collegian can become as narrow as his village playmate who graduated at the common school if both remain for their life work in the isolated environment of

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.459.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.459.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.459.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

these local conditions, prejudices and misconceptions. Both of them come to
this Exposition. The encircling horizon which made coincident their physical
and intellectual vision expands with their minds and embraces States and cities, arts and industries. They see the vastness and independence of our internal if commerce. They learn that the more intelligently selfish any business may be, the more patriotically it encourages every other industry and contributes to the general weal. The solution of the century-vexing problem of capital and labor grows simpler. They see that even a railroad president may be a public-spirited citizen without betraying the interests or lessening the business of his company; and that the money power is the concentration of the capital of the many at convenient centers of financial operations and contact with the world, here it lies idle and useless in times of distrust, but is easily drawn to the beneficent purposes and productive energies of the community which can give it profitable employment. Those from large cities learn that we York and Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago are marts of trade, not places of power. The country feeds and recruits them. They reflect and do not originate the conditions and opinions of the Republic. The untraveled city man is the most provincial of mortals. His local pride paralyzes his powers of observation, and the rest of the universe exists only for his benefit and by his permission. The West is an unknown land of grazing plains, mining camps, and big game. But he finds here the broadest culture of the schools and colleges, a vigorous and healthy public sentiment, the courage to try and the ability to utilize every invention which will increase the productive power and decrease the cost of operating the farm, the forest, the manufactory and the mine. Thus the broader education brings into contact and activity all the elements of our strength and growth. Self-centered satisfaction is an insurmountable barrier to mental, moral or material growth.</p>

<p>"Foreign cities say Americans boast of the bigness of their country. There
is no use denying the fact, we are big. We are not too large for a destiny
never so manifest as today. Cuba is under our protection and certain to come
under our flag by the vote of the people. Porto Rico is ours; our foothold
in the Philippines will never be surrendered, and the markets, in the far East
are inviting us to compete with the nations of Europe for their trade. Big as we are, the future is bigger with duties, responsibilities and opportunities for our citizens. The sentimentalist declares that such a review as has occupied our hour today is the grossest materialism. After years of experiment and observation I have found that sentiment has less alloy, is purer, and attains loftier ideals under a well thatched roof, than on the sod; under storms as well as sunshine, and with drenching clouds as well as stars above. 'What makes a hero in battles?' I inquired of a veteran, the victor on many a bloody field. His answer as, 'Plenty of good beef or mutton and hot coffee.'</p>

<p>"When Nebraska has reached the age of New York there will be a population of over to hundred millions in the United States. Our domain will be sufficient for their support, and our institutions elastic enough for their orderly

government and their liberty. Intelligence will be keen and high, and the State
will be very close to the daily life and industrial activities of the people. Co-operation will be working to an extent no thought chimerical. There will be
always differences of conditions as God has endowed His children with degrees
of gifts, but the much abused doctrine that the world owes every man a living
will be in general vogue and practice. The lazy, the shiftless and the improvident
will grumble and suffer then as no, but there will be a place for all according
to the talents bestowed upon them, and wisely perfected plans for the care
and comfort of the aged and helpless.</p>

<p>"The war with Spain had unified our country. The sons of the South and
the North, fighting side by side, and under the old flag, have effaced the last
vestige of the passions of the Civil war. The young men of the farthest West
and its primitive conditions lying with their comrades from the circles of the
clubs and fashion in the East, in the trenches of El Caney, and charging up
the hill and over the defenses of San Juan have made the men of the West
and the East one by the baptism of blood. whether from the plains of Arizona
or the palaces of New York, and whether dressed in broadcloth or in buckskin.
the rough-rider is the same American.</p>

<p>"Venerable New York sends hail and cordial congratulations to young
Nebraska. Our settlement is to hundred and forty, and our sovereignty ninety
years older than yours. Three centuries of development, under original conditions and free institutions, greet this half century of the West from the appointed a savage to the industrious citizen with the past and present full of cheer and hope. First among the States of the Republic in population, prosperity, educational institutions, churches, productive power and wealth, and commanding the resources of the continent through her metropolis, the second city of the world, New York owes it all to American liberty and opportunity. It is her pride and pleasure to attract and welcome the citizens of all the sister States. The people of the South, the West and the Pacific, have found hospitable homes in the Empire State in numbers greater than the population of many cities in those
sections. These fraternal ties intertwining with the bonds of patriotism and
if common interest bind our States together in one indissoluble Union, and make
us all one people, of one country and under one flag."</p>

sham battle. In the evening a banquet as given at the Omaha Club to the
distinguished guests by the former residents of New York State, no living in
Omaha. Hon. We. M. Bartlett, of Omaha, acted as toastmaster, and many of
Omaha's prominent citizens were present. Rev. S. Wright Butler responded to
the toast, "Our Guests," in a most happy manner, eliciting great applause for his wit and humor. Hon. John L. Webster responded to the toast, "What Are We
Here For?" Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, in his characteristic, happy vein, spoke
to the sentiment, "New Yorkers." General John C. Coin responded to the toast,
"Westard the Course of Empire Takes Its way." Senator Warner Miller,
"The Nicaraguan Canal." Senator W. E. Corwine, of New York Merchants' Exchange, "Relations Between the West and the East." J. H. Metcalf, of Buffalo, "The Pan-American Exposition." President Wattles, "The Trans-Mississippi Exposition." Hon. E. Rosewater, "The Press." Hon. F. B. Thurber, "Foreign Commercial Relations." Judge Wakely closed the speaking with a toast of "Rip Van Winkle," applied to the guests from the Empire State, "Here's to your health and that of your families; may you live long and prosper."</p>

<p>JUBILEE WEEK</p>

<p>October 10 to 15 inclusive, 1898</p>

<p>Jubilee week as the crowning week in historical importance during the
Exposition, and as such has been given consideration in Part I, Chapter III, of
this history, which treats of the historical events of the Exposition. Its historical importance had its relation not only to the Exposition, as such, but will pass down into history as one of the most interesting epochs in the annals of the West. It must be borne in mind that the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition originated in the midst of trial and tribulation that tested the courage, energy and combative qualities of the strongest men in the Western territory. Unprecedented drouth for a period of y-ears previous to the inception of the proposition had reduced the products of the soil, and thereby curtailed the commerce of the territory to such a degree that bankruptcy stared every. interest from that of the farmer to that of the manufacturer, in the face, but under the motto, "The true benefactor of mankind is he who makes two blades of grass grow here only one grew before," coupled with the motto, "Nothing succeed like success," these sturdy captains of industry, the Executive Committee of ways and Means, the late Edward Rosewater, of the Department of Publicity, Gilbert M. Hitchcock, of the Department of Promotion, Freeman P. Kirkendall, of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, Abram L. Reed, of the Department of Exhibits, William N. Babcock, of the Department of Transportation, with President Gurdon W. Wattles at the head, and his strong hand

on the helm, and Secretary John A. Wakefield, in charge of the records,
forged ahead, waving aside all objectors, critics, pessimists and obstructors,
much as a giant snow plow on a great railway would drive through the heavy
A drifts that obstructed traffic for the time being; and out of it came this great Exposition. But, after much of the difficulty had been overcome, the war with Spain broke upon the horizon, which great event in history as begun, aged
and ended, during these trying days of the creation of this Exposition. The
necessary appropriation of Congress, for the Government building, and the
Government exhibit as imperiled, was as likewise the appropriations from
many of the Trans-Mississippi States, but when, on that memorable Fourth day
of July of the Exposition period, when the multitudes were celebrating the
birthday of our nation on the Exposition grounds, as they had never celebrated
before, the telegram as received and read to the multitude, announcing the
destruction of the Spanish fleet, under Cervera, by our naval fleet under Sampson and Schley, coupled with that other telegram received on the same day
and at almost the same hour, announcing the ultimatum of unconditional surrender of the Spanish armies, submitted by General Shafter, the end of the
brief war as thus proclaimed, and the Jubilee week of the Exposition immediately planned. The presence of the President of the United States, with his cabinet, and the diplomatic corps, as essential to meet the magnitude of the importance of the event, and negotiations were immediately entered upon. The week beginning October 10, 1898, and ending October 15, 1898, as fixed for
the great event. Every detail as so carefully orked out that not a moment's
delay occurred in carrying out the program of the week at the appointed time.

<p>GOVERNORS' DAY AT OMAHA EXPOSITION—October 11, 1898</p>

<p>Address of Alva M. Adams, Governor of Colorado:</p>

<p>"With forty-eight States and Territories, not counting the uncounted island
possessions of our flag, governors are so plenty that their dignity and importance makes but little impress to the sight-seer who pays his fifty cents admission. Geronimo and his Indians, or a long-haired "Bill" from the mountains, is a greater sight than the chief executive of a new State. Democracy does not exalt its servants. It is well that it is so, as governors are transient—they come and go—but the state and nation go on forever. It is the glory of the Republic that it is the people and not the official that gives true dignity and power to our Government. As the people, so the nation. The Governor is but an incident, and fortunate if he can add a single sentence to the history of liberty that is being

woven by the American people. Since Independence Bell proclaimed, at Philadelphia, the birth of a new nation, we have been driven by the imperious whip of progress. This Exposition is the last milestone in the pathway of advancement. It is an object lesson that tells the world that there has been no halting in the march of growth and evolution. This is best because the latest. It eclipses its past as the next exposition will eclipse this. Tomorrow ever holds a surprise for the man of today. If children were not wiser than their parents and the new not better than the old, progress would be a myth and civilization a delusion. As heirs of the past it is for this generation to place its feet upon higher ground than yet pressed by the race. growth is the obligation that rests upon every mortal. From Darwin's ape to the American citizen is a long distance, but it has been traveled. It is a long road from the forge of Tubal Cain to the Carnegie steel agricultural, from the primitive methods of Abraham to the multiplied ants and supply of today, from the sling of David to the Krupp cannon and the perfected Winchester, from the rude weaving of the Indian maiden to the cotton and woolen mills of the present. These contrasts are exemplified in this exhibition, and they are a rich lesson of hope and encouragement to every American. Here art shows her triumphs and mechanical genius its victories. The rude stone here to women ground the corn has given way to the Washburn mills, the pointed stick to the gang plow, the Hail and the tramping cattle to the steam thresher, the sickle to the harvester. Why multiply illustrations? They are everywhere upon these grounds, and should inspire new strength and courage for another long step forward to that hour when every man that toils shall receive the full and due product of his labor, when justice will reign. The mission of the age is to plant ever new moral and intellectual frontiers, to broaden the horizon of human happiness. If we can not raise the average, if we can not lift the masses, then will this Exposition be a failure, and our talk but tinkling cymbals, our work the building of Babel

towers. Expositions are not alone shows-they are universities as well. Size
is not always or often a standard of excellence. The caravels of Columbus measured but sixty tons, the Mayflower but a hundred-yet they carried the destiny of the world and the seed of this nation. This Exposition is not as large as the World's Fair of 1893, but it has new features of beauty, new testimonials of national power and growth. Then it is Western, and some of us love it the more because it reflects the West. We are loyal to the Union. We are ready to defend every one over which floats the flag, whether upon the continent or the islands of the sea; but there is special satisfaction over the prosperity and achievement of the region in which our home is planted. Our origin is the same, as we are each a part of the Louisiana Purchase. This exhibit reflects the greatness of the empire which the statesmanship of Jefferson gave to liberty and civilization.</p>

<p>"Would that the spirits of Fisher Ames, Daniel Webster and Josiah
Quincy might wander through the avenues and aisles of this Exposition, which
has sprung from the bosom of that desert, which their eloquence painted in
such forbidding colors. They were great men but poor prophets. The stone
they would have rejected has become the keystone in the arch of national
power and greatness.</p>

<p>"Many provincial friends in the Eastern States have held Ames, Webster
and Quincy as authority upon the West. The splendid audacity of Omaha in 
creating this Exposition has levied upon our gratitude. It has been a revelation to the self-centered Yankees; they no realize that the Mississippi River is
not the Western limit of the Republic, and that the las of gravitation are not
suspended West of the Missouri.</p>

<p>"I am not sure but what the typical American is to be developed upon
the prairies or in the mountain valleys of this new land. The charm of adventure, romance and opportunity has led the active daring spirits of every land

and State into the West, and here these many elements of manhood are being
oven into a strong, vigorous, homogeneous citizenship. Under clearer
skies, with a broad horizon, closer to nature, no westerner may be careless
of the conventionalities; untrammeled by tradition, he is free to grasp the best in the past as material from which to mould a new, perhaps an original, civilization. The Western man is the restless migratory son of other States and countries; many of us are but Eastern men with a wider experience—our view covers the nation. We admit equality, but in average attainments concede no superiority. In cemeteries and in cherished prejudices, we can not compete
with the East; but in fealty and pride of country, we are their brothers. The
men of the West think more of posterity than of ancestors. Like Cicero, they
hope to be the founder of a family. They do not point to the achievements of
their fathers, but to their on. They do not go out to God's Acre to read their
family standing graven upon the crumbling tombstones of five or more
generations. Good or bad, their position is due to their on efforts. If the
West has an aristocracy, it is based upon deeds, not ancestors.</p>

<p>"Having less wealth and leisure, the West may be less refined, but in
manly qualities, in sterling manhood, they are not deficient. A rough exterior
may hide the courage of a Richard, and a chivalry as fine as ever animated a knight may bloom in the heart of plainsman and mountaineer. The civilizing value of a dress suit may not impress them, but in genuine manly qualities they are strong. Their purse is open to misfortune, their friendship and sympathy go
to those who need; kindly and generous, yet holding a nerve and a courage
that is not slow to avenge every wrong.</p>

<p>"The idols of savagery have been thrown down in the West, new altars
have been reared; but upon them new ideas and new faiths have not been placed.
Liberty, truth and patriotism here find a genial soil.</p>

<p>"Art and luxury are the growing pride of the rich, but this tendency is
not strong in the West. We have them, but only as feathers to the arrows of

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.466.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.466.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.466.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

our growing power. This Exposition demonstrates that it is the material elements that measure our progress. The product of mine, forge and clanging
shops are the gauge of power. If the golden age is ever to come it will be
under a agricultural of iron. This panorama of native wealth startles the American as well as the foreign visitor. It wins the admiration of the stranger and fortifies the faith of the citizen. We do not realize the greatness of our
country. We have not been daring enough to grasp the present, still less our
sublime destiny. Though but the logical lesson from our history, the result
of the recent war as a revelation. It gave our flag standing abroad; it
inspired confidence at home; it made Yankee Doodle a classic in many lands; it
gave us faith in our on sons. Hereafter we need not go to Homer or to the
records of chivalry for brave deeds. The heroism of our on sons gives material
for song and story; the charges of our soldiers at Manila and Santiago, the
skill of our sailors upon their ships, are elements of national power that supplement our mines of gold and far-stretching fields of waving harvest. Character is a greater asset than wealth. America has both, and it is a Union of strength that is invincible. American valor is not local. Sons of East
and West, North and South, were alike brave, alike willing to sacrifice for
country. There as no rivalry, save in competition to see who could first risk
his life for the flag. In this conflict there as no disappointment, except when
unable to be first at the front. Only a great people are worthy such sons. To
be an American today is to realize the thrill that the soldier of Caesar felt when he declared himself a Roman citizen.</p>

<p>"With such valiant sons to guard, with such a material future as this
Exposition prophesies, we may well be proud of our land. The achievements
here demonstrated press upon us the fact that the possibilities of soil, factory and mine are many times our power of consumption. These embarrassments
of riches should inspire the wise statesman to seek new markets. As trade follows the flag, does not patriotic selfishness as well as humanity impel us to insist that here the sacrifice of soldier and sailor have planted the agricultural—there
it must stay."</p>

<p>PRESIDENT'S DAY—October 12, 1898</p>

<p>Address of President Gurdon W. Wattles:</p>

<p>"Our hearts are filled with gratitude and thanksgiving today because of
the welcome return of peace to our nation. We meet to celebrate the victories
of our arms and to rejoice that the clouds of war have passed and that the sunbeams of peace again bathe our beloved land. I voice the sentiment of all
inhabitants of our country in expressions of welcome and heartfelt greetings to
our beloved President, our honored guest today. If I could gather from the
hearts of our people the love and adoration they feel for him, and present it,
like agricultural flowers in tangible form, I might in a faint degree offer a welcome worthy of the occasion. words fail to express and language can not convey the joy and gratitude we feel that the President of this great nation, accompanied by members of his cabinet, by representatives of foreign countries, by

<p>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT WILLIAM MCKINLEY</p>

<p>President McKinley spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition and Fellow Citizens: It is
with genuine pleasure that I meet once more the people of Omaha, whose
wealth of welcome is not altogether unfamiliar to me and whose arm hearts
have before touched and moved me. For this renewed manifestation of your
regard and for the cordial reception of today my heart responds with profound
gratitude and a deep appreciation which I can not conceal, and which the
language of compliment is inadequate to convey. My greeting is not alone to
your city and the State of Nebraska, but to the people of all the States of the
Trans-Mississippi group participating here, and I can not withhold congratulations on the evidences of their prosperity furnished by this great Exposition. If testimony were needed to establish the fact that their pluck has not deserted them and that prosperity is again with them it is found here. This picture dispels all doubt.</p>

<p>"In an age of expositions they have added yet another magnificent example.
The historical celebrations at Philadelphia and Chicago, and the splendid exhibits at New Orleans, Atlanta and Nashville are now a part of the past, and yet in influence they still live, and their beneficent results are closely interwoven with

our nation development. Similar rewards will honor the authors and patrons
of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. Their contribution will
mark another epoch in the nation's material advancement.</p>

<p>"One of the great laws of life is progress, and nowhere have the principles
of this law been so strikingly illustrated as in the United States. A century and
a decade of our national life have turned doubt into conviction; changed experiment into demonstration; revolutionized old methods and on new triumphs
which have challenged the attention of the world. This is true not only of the
accumulation of material wealth and advance in education, science, invention
and manufactures, but above all in the opportunities to the people for their
on elevation which have been secured by wise free government.</p>

<p>"Hitherto, in peace and in war, with additions to our territory and
changes in our laws, we have steadily enforced the spirit of the constitution
secured to us by the noble self-sacrifice and far-seeing sagacity of our ancestors.
We have avoided the temptations of conquest in the spirit of gain. with an
increasing love for our institutions and an abiding faith in their stability, we
have made the triumphs of our system of government in the progress and
prosperity of our people an inspiration to the whole human race. Confronted
at this moment by new and grave problems, we must recognize that their solution
will affect not ourselves alone but others of the family of nations.</p>

<p>"In this age of frequent interchange and mutual dependency, we can not
shirk our international responsibilities if we would; they must be met with

</div>

courage and wisdom and we must follow duty even if desire opposes. No
deliberation can be too mature, or self-control too constant, in this solemn hour
of our history. We must avoid the temptation of undue aggression and aim to
secure only such results as will promote our own and the general good.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.471.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.471.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.471.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"It has been said by someone that the normal condition of nations is war.
That is not true of the United States. We never enter upon war until every
effort for peace without it has been exhausted. Ours has never been a military
government. Peace, with whose blessings we have been so singularly favored, is
the national desire, and the goal of every American aspiration.</p>

<p>"On the 25th of April, for the first time for more than a generation, the
United States sounded the call to arms. The banners of war were unfurled;
the best and bravest from every section responded; a mighty army as enrolled;
the North and the South vied with each other in patriotic devotion; science as
invoked to furnish its most effective weapons factories were rushed to supply
equipment; the youth and the veteran joined in freely offering their services
to their country; volunteers and regulars and all the people rallied to the support of the Republic. There as no break in the line, no halt in the march, no fear in the heart. No resistance to the patriotic impulse at home, no successful resistance to the patriotic spirit of the troops fighting in distant waters or on a foreign shore!</p>

<p>"What a wonderful experience is has been from the standpoint of patriotism and achievement! The storm broke so suddenly that is was here almost before we realized it. Our navy was too small, though forceful with its modern equipment and most fortunate in its trained officers and

sailors. Our army had years ago been reduced
to a peace footing. We had only nineteen thousand available troops when the
war as declared, but the account which officers and men gave of themselves
on the battlefields has never been surpassed. The manhood as there and
everywhere. American patriotism as there and its resources were limitless.
The courageous and invincible spirit of the people proved glorious, and those
who a little more than a third of a century ago were divided and at war with
each other were again united under the holy standard of liberty. Patriotism
banished party feeling; fifty million dollars for the national defense as appropriated without debate or division, as a matter of course, and as only a mere
indication of our mighty reserve power.</p>

<p>"But if this is true of the beginning of the war what shall we say of it
now, with hostilities suspended and peace near at hand, as we fervently hope?
Matchless in its results! Unequaled in its completeness, and the quick succession with which victory followed victory! Attained earlier than it was believed to be possible; so comprehensive in its seep that every thoughtful man feels the eight of responsibility which has been so suddenly thrust upon us. And above all, and beyond all, the valor of the American army and the bravery of

the American navy, and the majesty of the American name stand forth in
unsullied glory, while the humanity of our purposes, and the magnanimity of
our conduct have given to war, always horrible, touches of noble generosity,
Christian sympathy and charity, and examples of human grandeur which can
never be lost to mankind. Passions and bitterness formed no part of our impelling motive, and it is gratifying to feel that humanity triumphed at every step of the war's progress.</p>

<p>"The heroes of Manila and Santiago and Porto Rico have made immortal
history, they are worthy successors and descendants of Washington and Greene;
of Paul Jones, Decatur and Hull, and of Grant, Sherman, Sheridan and Logan,
of Farragut, Porter and Cushing, and of Lee, Jackson and Longstreet.</p>

<p>"New names stand out on the honor roll of the nation's great men, and with
them unnamed stand the heroes of the trenches and the forecastle, invincible in
battle and uncomplaining in death. The intelligent, loyal, indomitable soldier
and sailor and the marine regular and volunteer, are entitled to equal praise as
having down their whole duty, whether at home or under the baptism of foreign
fire.</p>

<p>"Who will dim the splendor of their achievements? Who will withhold
from them their well earned distinction? Who will intrude detraction at this
time to belittle the manly spirit of the American youth and impair the usefulness of the American army? Who will embarrass the Government by sowing seeds of dissatisfaction among the brave men who stand ready to serve and die, if need be, for their country? Who will darken the counsels of the Republic in
this hour requiring the united wisdom of all?</p>

<p>"Shall we deny to ourselves what the rest of the world so freely and so
justly accord to us? The men who endured in the short but decisive struggle
its hardships, its privations, whether in field or camp, on ship or in the siege, and planned and achieved its victories, will never tolerate impeachment, either as direct or indirect, of those who won a peace whose great gain to civilization is yet unknown and unwritten.</p>

<p>"The faith of a Christian nation recognizes the hand of Almighty God in
the ordeal through which we have passed. Divine favor seems manifest everywhere. In lighting for humanity's sake we have been signally blessed. We did not seek war. To avoid it, if this could be done in justice and honor to the rights of our neighbors and ourselves, as our constant prayer. The war as
no more invited by us than were the questions which are laid at our door by
its results. No, as then, we will do our duty. The problems will not be solved
in a day. Patience will be required; patience combined with sincerity of purpose and unshaken resolution to do right, seeking only the highest good of a
nation and recognizing no other obligation, pursuing no other path but that of
duty.</p>

<p>"Right action follows right purpose. We may not at all times be able to
divine the future, the way may not always seem clear; but if our aims are high
and unselfish, somehow and in some way the right end will be reached. The

<p>ARMY AND NAVY DAY—October 13, 1898</p>

<p>Address of Major General Nelson A. Miles:</p>

<p>"It is gratifying to know that the people of the mighty West gathered in
this great Exposition have set apart one day in which to honor the army and
navy of the United States. Speaking for the army, I may say it has been most closely identified with the welfare, progress and prosperity of the West
than with any other portion of this great country. It as up this river that
as led in the early years of the century a little band of explorers past the site of your beautiful city and destined to discover the wealth, the resources and the beauty of our newly acquired and vast territory, extending from the 'Father of Waters,' to the broad Pacific, and render immortal the names of Leis and Clark. It as near this spot that many of the most important expeditions have been organized and equipped for the exploration and conquest of the wilderness occupied by numerous and powerful tribes of savages, and it as here that the army found ever cordial welcome upon returning from these perilous and
hazardous enterprises. Here as initiated that great expedition which wound
its way slowly among the hills into the plain, and then with steadily increasing speed until the stroke of a hammer upon a golden nail telegraphed to the world on the 9th of May, 1869, the completion of the first Trans-Continental railway, we and a prophecy of the matchless material progress, whose fruition we no see demonstrated here.</p>

<p>"Individually, there is no place here I feel more at home than in the
great West. Tenty-six of the best years of my life have been spent in service

West of the Missouri River. As I have been identified with its trials and
privations, and in full sympathy with its sacrifices and its heroic struggle, so I have had the pleasure of witnessing its marvelous growth and development, and its grand and splendid prosperity.</p>

<p>"Here we find the true spirit of American enterprise. It as the prospect
of these fields which tempted from their homes the most heroic, the most resolute and the boldest spirits, whose children having caught the inspiration of their fathers, are no, in independence of character, true progressive spirit, intelligence and integrity in the front rank of citizenship.</p>

<p>"The hardships endured and sacrifices made by the army, deprived of many
of the advantages of civilization in its service on the frontier, have been little known and little heeded or appreciated by the average citizen in the eastern portion of the United States; yet there has not been a camp of pioneers of miners, of herdsmen, or of colonists, in the vast and trackless wilderness of fifty years ago, who have not found the protecting presence of the resolute and faithful soldier standing and between the defenseless and the savage. During that period there has come such a transformation as was never before witnessed in the whole history of the human race. A trackless wilderness and barren waste has been transformed into communities and States which exert themselves in friendly rivalry to excel each other in modern industries, sciences, art and institutions of learning. The army rejoices in your magnificent prosperity.</p>

<p>"Let us remember that the army of the United States received its inspiration of integrity, honor and fortitude from the precept and example of that most
eminent and perfect soldier, citizen and statesman, its first commander, George
Washington. The army does not forget, and the country should not, his injunction to his countrymen, that, 'Timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it,' and we may well emphasize the doctrine, that to insure peace, we should be prepared for war.

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.475.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.475.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.475.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

There are other maxims of George Washington, to which we should recur at
the present time. For instance, 'The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to
foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as
little political connection as possible.'</p>

<p>"Another of incalculable importance no and always, is 'Promote then as
an object of prime importance the institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of the Government gives force to public
opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.</p>

<p>"The great element of strength for a republic, and especially for an army,
is the universal intelligence of its citizens and soldiers. A democratic government can not safely exist here this is wanting. In order to be a well equipped soldier, with us, a man must be first well informed, having due regard for the advantages, blessings and requirements of our institutions, and appreciating the obligation of the citizen to his Government, realizing that without patriotism, independence of character and integrity of purpose, a man can not fulfill the requirements of American citizenship. Intelligent patriotism in addition, when the citizen undertakes service in the army. or the navy, so demonstrates the fact that he possesses still another of the noblest traits of manhood and fortitude to A meet the needs of his country, and if need be die to uphold the inner of his flag and the existence of his Government. This has been the record of the American soldier for more than a hundred years. He is not forced to maintain a dynasty or support the power of a monarch, but he volunteers to serve for his country's good and for the protection, welfare and benefit of all who dell within the borders of the commonwealth. For more than a century the history of our army is one of glorious achievement and fortitude. Scarcely a year has passed but that the army has had to contend against a savage, crafty and warlike race from the time of Washington to the present day. The history of heroic service in those years gilds with an immortal fame the names and records of those men participating in the wars, whose sacrifices have amounted to a larger percentage of casualties than in those of the great wars between civilized nations. It as in that school that Washington himself had his first important lessons in the art of war, and the same can be said of Putnam, Greene, Schuyler, Marion, Wayne, Morgan, Jackson, worth, Taylor, and, indeed, Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>"Our army is made up of quite different material from that of the great
armies of Europe. The officers belong to no one family or class of aristocracy.
They come from the public schools, the farms, the counting houses, and the
colleges of the land. Many of them enlisted in the ranks, and through merit,
industry and gallantry have fought their way to the highest position of honor
and responsibility. The people of every State and the best families and elements of society are represented by soldiers in the ranks of the American army. We have hoped for many years that the American army might become a grand 
school of patriotism in which boys and young men enter and while serving
their country benefit themselves by gaining a thorough knowledge of the
principles of our Government, of our history and the advantages of our institu-

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.476.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.476.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.476.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

tions, and add to their knowledge how best they may serve their country in the hours of national peril and public danger. Possibly, we have been too unmindful of this during the last five and thirty years. For four years preceding that period our nation as engulfed in gloom, in the smoke and turmoil of terrible civil war, and only after four years of sacrifice and suffering did it emerge to a glorious epoch of peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>"During the period of development of the great West and marvelous prosperity of the following thirty years, people became indifferent to the condition of our army and navy, and as a result of that indifference we have found it necessary to mobilize an army for a foreign war without previous preparation and without the elements of equipment essential to its efficiency. Whether we
shall profit by the experience of the last few months remains to be seen. The
enormous expenditure of public money and the numberless complaints of suffering and hardship should, in my opinion, prompt the people to due attention to
the necessity of having in the future a well equipped military force commensurate with our interests as a nation, and with the requirements of our people here and those living beneath our agricultural in any quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>"I have for many years advocated the principle of having one soldier to
every one thousand of our population thoroughly instructed in the duties and
requirements of military life, and I think that standard could be maintained in
the future. As a nation grows in strength and responsibility, those to pillars
of support—its army and navy—should grow in proportion. I believe that our ships should be known in every sea, and with extended commerce there
should be built up of American material, armed with American guns, manned.
by American seamen, a navy sufficient to protect our agricultural and our interests in
every quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>"During the past few months our country has passed through an ordeal
which ought not to be repeated. The experience should teach us that tens and
hundreds of thousands of even the flower of our citizens can not suddenly be
moulded into well equipped, well officered, well supplied, well disciplined troops
in a few months.</p>

<p>"Whatever there has been of failure, of short-comings, of distress or of
suffering—above all, whatever there has been of hardship or horrors of war—the American army has written upon the pages of history a page that will illume its name forever; and it has met every privation, it has encountered every hardship, and it has faced every peril on land and sea incident to the war, and while it has captured guns, battlefields, prisoners, fortifications and territory, it has not in a single instance given an inch of ground to the enemy, nor has it lowered a flag of the Republic nor surrendered a color or a rifle to the enemy. It has carried the banner of freedom to the oppressed and suffering, and has been greeted and received, not as ruthless conquerors, but as liberators and defenders of the liberties and rights of mankind. Our agricultural has been hailed we as the morning light."</p>

<p>CIVIL GOVERNMENT DAY—October 14, 1898</p>

<p>Address of General William R. Shafter:</p>

<p>"I regret that I am not able to express in fitting words my appreciation of
the reception that I have received at your hands. For what little I may
have done I have been rewarded far beyond my wildest dreams. I little
thought that I should reach the highest rank when I marched away thirty-
six years ago as a volunteer of infantry. The highest reward a soldier can
receive is the gratitude and appreciation of his countrymen; and this, I believe, I no possess. Perhaps the most appropriate thing I can say is to give you a short history of the campaign in Cuba that has ended with so much honor to our arms. I as ordered to report at Washington, and as informed that I should lead the first expedition from the United States. I as ordered to Tampa with a vie to making a reconnaissance in Cuba in force, but this plan as subsequently abandoned, and we remained there ready for whatever service might be demanded. Then we were ordered to go and assist the fleet to capture the harbor and city of Santiago, and we embarked with an army of seventeen thousand
men. We had absolutely no maps of Cuba, but I had with me a couple of men
who were born at Santiago, and guided by information I received from them
I determined to land at the to points here I did. The result has convinced
me that my judgment as correct. No army has ever gone from a temperate
zone to the tropics without disaster, and for this reason I knew that the campaign must be pushed as rapidly as lay in human power and endurance. Although I had the best army that ever marched under an American flag, the climate as something awful. You who have never experienced its horrors can never realize them. I believed that we were strong enough to move on Santiago, and in three days I had landed the entire army. On June 25 we defeated the
Spaniards in a sharp engagement. They had been accustomed to fighting men
who were poorly fed and inadequately armed, and they were astounded at the
fighting qualities of our soldiers. It has been said that troops in trenches, armed with breech-loading rifles could not be successfully assailed, but we proved the fallacy of that idea.</p>

<p>We then decided on the capture of El Caney, and a division as detached
to make the charge. I thought that we could take it in to hours, but it required from ten o'clock in the morning until 4:30 in the afternoon. The Spaniards expected to be killed if they were captured, so most of them fought until they were killed, and no prisoners were taken. We never advanced beyond the position that we on in that fight. The enemy came out the next morning to
make an attack, but it as fruitless and only lasted an hour. Then the campaign as practically over. It as simply necessary to convince the Spanish
commander that his case was hopeless. He eventually surrendered, and, with
our small army, we had captured twenty-three thousand three hundred seventy-six prisoners, twelve thousand of whom were beyond our reach. Why the Span-

iards
 surrendered when they could have abandoned their position and kept up
the war I do not yet understand, but I believe it as because they had been
informed that the Spanish Government had decided to give up the fight and
surrender their soldiers in the eastern part of the island.</p>

<p>"The problem of that campaign as supplies. The lighting as the least
part of it and the soonest over. There were times when the men were short.
You who were in the civil war remember that there were many times during
that conflict when we were short of rations, but then we could always forage.
But in Cuba there as nothing to confiscate, and the army depended entirely
on the supplies that were forwarded with the greatest difficulty over roads that were at times impassible. while most of the fighting in Cuba as done by the regular army, the volunteers did all they were required to do, and they did it like soldiers."</p>

<p>Very low excursion rates from all parts of the State had been made by the
railroads, and it as planned to make Nebraska Day the greatest day of the
Exposition, but on account of the bad weather the attendance, though very large,
was not as great as had been expected. The Governor and his staff, the Nebraska

State Commission, State officers and other officials, were escorted in carriages to

<p>UTAH DAY—October 20, 1898</p>

<p>The Governor of Utah, accompanied by his staff and many prominent if
residents of that State, came to celebrate their day at the Exposition. The exercises were held in the Auditorium. The program was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg program">
<span class="l">Music ............................................................... Omaha Concert Band</span>
<span class="l">Welcome .............................................................. President Wattles</span>

<span class="l">Address .......................................................... Hon. George Q. Cannon</span>
<span class="l">Address ................................... President Joseph Smith, of the Mormon Church</span></span>

<p>The exercises were of special interest on account of the presence of the
Governor of the State and the three presidents of the Mormon church. The early
reminiscences of some of these men who had nearly half a century before spent
a inter at Florence, Nebr., and had followed Brigham Young across the
then Great American Desert, were instructive, especially compared with the present
civilization which has grown up in the West during the lives of these men.</p>

<p>RAILROAD WEEK—October 23 to 29, 1898</p>

<p>The last week of the Exposition has been designated as Railroad week, in
order that the railroads might bring to the Exposition on low excursion rates
all those who had not yet seen its beauties. The excursion rates fixed by all
the railroads reaching out from Omaha were extremely low. For instance, the
Union Pacific Railroad sold a $4 round-trip ticket from the Western part of
the State to Omaha and return. The C. R. I. &amp; P. sold railroad tickets from

points in Kansas and return at $2 and $2.50, here the regular fare one way
as $6 and $7. Other railroads gave similar rates, and the effect of these
low rates as to bring to the Exposition great crowds during the last week of
its history.</p>

<p>On October 20 a special train bearing President Frank Thompson, the
Board of Directors and many of the officials of the Pennsylvania Railroad, arrived.
By special invitation the officers of the Exposition and Executive Committee were
invited to lunch with the Pennsylvania officials in their private dining-car. A
number of railroad officials living in Omaha were also invited. The dinner served
was one of the most pleasant informal affairs given during the Exposition.
Saturday, October 22, as especially set aside for the children, who were
admitted free on that day. 'Excursions from many parts of the State brought
in thousands of the little ones and the return of sunshine after the inclement
weather of the week past made the day a most enjoyable one, and largely increased
the attendance of the Exposition, no less than 13,594 children having been
admitted free.</p>

<p>On Sunday, October 23, the German Parade, which had been postponed
on German Day on account of the inclement weather, as given. This parade
formed in the vicinity of Germania Hall and marched to the Exposition grounds.
Numerous bands, elaborately decorated floats and a long line of carriages with
distinguished German guests marched through the principal streets of the city.
At the Exposition grounds the day as spent by the participants without formal
exercises.</p>

<p>TRI-CITY DAY—October 26, 1898</p>

<p>Davenport, Rock Island and Moline united to make this one of the special
days in the history of the Exposition, and the several train-loads of delegates
from these cities, though somewhat belated, spent a most enjoyable day on the
grounds. The exercises were held in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock a. m., and 
the program was as follows:</p>

<span class="lg program">

<p>OMAHA DAY—October 31, 1898</p>

<p>It having been decided that the gates of the Exposition would close on
October 31, this day as designated as Omaha Day, and every effort as used
to make it one of the banner days of the Exposition. Mayor Moores issued a
proclamation reciting the many benefits that Omaha has received from the

Exposition, praising its management and declaring Omaha Day an official holiday.
He urged all places of business to close and every citizen of the city to attend
the Exposition on that day. The Board of Education ordered the schools closed,
the Commercial Club and labor organizations urged the universal celebration of
this holiday, and every citizen of Omaha seemed to take on himself the responsibility of working for the success of this day. Proprietors of many of the large
stores distributed tickets of admission among their employes. Charitable citizens
distributed hundreds of tickets to the poor of the city through the assistance of
the associated charities.</p>

<p>The last day of the Exposition, like the first, as one of bright sunshine.
The exercises of the day were planned to take place in the Auditorium at 3 o'clock
p. m., immediately after the band concert. The program was as follows:</p>

<p>Mayor Moores spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"It is fitting that the closing day of the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition should be set
aside as Omaha Day, for from its inception
this great enterprise had been dependent
upon the energy, sagacity and benevolence of
the citizens of Omaha.</p>

<p>"Omaha far-sightedness planned this
Exposition when the leaden skies of adversity
hung heavy over the land; Omaha courage
inspired the Trans-Mississippi region with
faith in the future, and secured promises of
a cooperation and assistance from the Western 
cities and States, when financial panic and
business depression were trying the stoutest
hearts; Omaha liberality and generosity furnished the vast amount of money required to
secure the successful completion of the Exposition plans; Omaha intelligence and energy

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>City Hall, Omaha</p>
 
</div> 

have directed and managed the enterprise;
and no, most properly, to Omaha has been accorded the honor of closing the
Exposition. I trust that when the turnstiles cease clicking tonight they will have
registered the largest daily attendance ever seen upon these grounds.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.482.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.482.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.482.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"This Exposition has been a benefit to Omaha in many ways. It has inspired
the Omaha people with faith in themselves and in their city. It has shown our
citizens that no enterprise is too large for them to undertake and carry to
successful completion if they work together and give it their loyal support. It
has made Omaha people proud of their city and they have formed the habit of
doing their part to make the city neat, clean and attractive, and of saying the
best things about Omaha, instead of talking to friends and visitors about the
failings of the city. In fact, many of our most hopeless old fogies have become
accustomed to hearing other people say good things about Omaha that they
sometimes find themselves praising the city. Then, again, the hundreds of
thousands of persons who have visited our city have gone to their homes in
various parts of the country singing the praises of Omaha hospitality, liberality,
pluck, push, energy and thrift, and hundreds of
business men and manufacturers are now looking
toward Omaha for the purpose of locating new
establishments here. My prediction is that during
the next ten years Omaha will experience a larger
proportion of growth than any other city in the
country, and that the close of the decade will see
here a population of 250,000 to 300,000 with a
commensurate increase in business in all lines.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Frank E. Moores, Mayor of Omaha</p>
 
</div>

<p>"The country at large believes in Omaha, and
visitors have not been slow to voice their approval,
That distinguished statesman and diplomat,
ex-Governor Crittenden, of Missouri, in an address
here on Kansas City Day, said: 'The record
Omaha has made in erecting this Exposition is
marvelous. Kansas City could not have done it;
St. Louis could not have done it; in fact, no other Western city could have accomplished the task. Such an enterprise required a complete unity and a splendid
liberality and public spirit, which no other city, I believe, possesses.'</p>

<p>"Such words from such a source should fill our citizens with greater pride
in their city.</p>

<p>"I feel that at this time I should poorly represent the people of Omaha if I
should close these remarks without expressing to the directors and especially to
the officers and board of managers of the Exposition the gratitude of their fellow
citizens for their devoted, unselfish labors, which have brought the Exposition to
this splendid culmination. They have succeeded far beyond our fondest dreams. I
wish to thank them in behalf of the citizens of Omaha for what they have
accomplished here and for the good they have done the city.</p>

<p>"And no, fellow citizens, as the Exposition closes, let us look forward to the
future with faith and courage and let us one and all put our shoulders to the
wheel of Omaha prosperity and progress. The future of Greater Omaha is in
your hands."</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.483.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.483.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.483.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>Manager Lindsey spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Away back in the good old times which we have all heard about and some
of us have seen, there used to be an occasion at the close of the district school
called the 'last day.' It as a gala day, as it meant freedom from lessons and
restraint and because it ushered in a long-looked-for holiday.</p>

<p>"The management has come to the 'last day' of the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition; our tasks are almost ended, and our holiday is near
at hand. We have all seen on the Midway some wonderful and beautiful illusions,
and have been mystified by many marvelous feats of magic, but the greatest marvel
of all has been the Exposition itself. To transfer an irregular cornfield into
fairyland, with magnificent buildings, stately domes, graceful colonnades, beautiful flower gardens, pleasant groves, splashing fountains and the hole illuminated by a tracery
of brilliant lights—to do all this in less than two years does indeed seem a feat worthy of Aladdin and his lamp.</p>

<p>"Unlike our friends on the Midway, I am
going to tell you how this marvel as done. First
of all it did not come by chance, nor by inheritance.
Some would have you believe it as a streak of
luck, that good fortune, like a pillar of cloud , preceded us by day and hovered over us like a pillar of fire at night. While I believe that an overruling Providence aided us with clear skies,
pleasant weather and bountiful harvests, still I
must repudiate the good-luck theory, and attribute

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Zachary T. Lindsey</p>
 
</div>

the stupendous success of the Exposition to the
common sense, every-day business ideas, to the sleepless nights, and the persistent
hard work of the members of the executive committee.</p>

<p>"Social pleasures, personal comfort and individual business requirements
have all been brushed aside, and no obstacle has been allowed to interfere with
the successful outcome of our aims—an Exposition worthy of its name and the
great territory it represents."</p>

<p>Continuing, Mr. Lindsey briefly reviewed the work of securing the funds
with which to promote such a colossal enterprise and expressed his grateful
acknowledgment of the confidence that the people had reposed in the management
of the Exposition. He also paid a tribute to the men on whom they had called for
advice and encouragement in times of discouragement and trial, and expressed
the thanks of the management to every one who had contributed to make the
Exposition what it is. In conclusion, he said that while there had been much
hard work in the building of the Exposition, there as also much that as
pleasant, and if, in the stress and worry consequent upon so vast an undertaking
there had arisen any unpleasant memories he asked that they be consigned to rest

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.484.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.484.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.484.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

and that the people should remember that what had been done had been done for
the glory of Omaha, of Nebraska, and of the Trans-Mississippi region.</p>

<p>Manager Edward Rosewater's address:</p>

<p>Mr. Rosewater said that the birth of most great men creates no ripple of
excitement except in the midst of their on family and friends. So some of the
most momentous epochs in the history of the world have been ushered in without
attracting the attention of the world at large. It had come under his personal
observation that even when the proclamation of emancipation as issued by
President Lincoln it excited no visible demonstration in the city here it as
promulgated. This as also true of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. The
inception of the enterprise had attracted but little
attention in this community. Even those who
participated in its birth did not realize that oaks
from little acorns grow. Three months after
Omaha as selected as the site of the Exposition
scarcely forty men met at the Commercial Club to
start the subscription list. The first man wanted
to head the list for $100, but over $10,000 was
finally subscribed. Even when we went before
Congress for $300,000 appropriation only $1,250
had been paid in.</p>

<div class="inline_figure"><div class="p">[illustration]</div>
<p>Hon. Edward Rosewater</p>
 
</div>

<p>"It as the greatest piece of adamantine gall
I ever saw," continued the speaker, "but we succeeded, not only in getting the original appropriation, but $40,000 additional for the organization
and maintenance of the Indian Congress. It was
not luck that brought this about, but hard labor. While few of our people
realize, and many never will realize, what has been done, they can see the results
since 2,600,000 people have passed through our gates. Even some of our best
business men refused to co-operate in the enterprise and freely predicted calamity
and disaster. Only five State legislatures made appropriations, but we have
twenty States creditably represented on the grounds through private subscriptions."</p>

<p>In this connection Mr. Rosewater called attention to some of the municipal
jealousies that had handicapped the management in securing outside co-operation
in the early days of the enterprise, and related one or to humorous incidents
that effectively illustrated the difficulties that had been encountered.</p>

<p>Speaking of the work of his on department, Mr. Rosewater said that the
labors of the Department of Publicity had extended from Massachusetts to
Oregon and Washington; They had involved daily and nightly attention, and
the correspondence that had been carried on would fill many volumes. "But," he
concluded, "I will not weary you with telling what we have done. Here we
have the result, the most marvelous achievement that the pioneers of the West
have ever undertaken and accomplished. We have found that what Omaha

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.485.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.485.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.485.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

undertakes to do she will complete, and that Omaha can do as much as any
other city to develop the resources of the West. Chicago received money enough
from the general government to build ten expositions. Even then they had to
postpone it a year, while, in spite of the war and in spite of the circumstances, we
opened our Exposition promptly on time and we will close it tonight with all the
glory that any one could wish."</p>

<p>ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT WATTLES</p>

<p>President Wattles spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Within a few hours the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition
will have passed into history. It is proper on this occasion to review briefly the
progress of this enterprise, and while the work of its promoters and the results
of their labors are more or less familiar to all the inhabitants of this community,
the efficient services rendered by a few of our citizens, without compensation for
the public good, can only be fully appreciated when the grand results attained
and their importance to this city and the West are fully understood.</p>

<p>"In the fall of 1895, when this Exposition as first proposed, the business
interests of this community were at their lowest ebb. To arouse the people of this
city and of the West from the stupor of discouragement and depression
which pervaded all our business interests, and to enlist their financial aid and
co-operation in a great Exposition of the resources of the West, as a stupendous
undertaking. No one can appreciate the discouragements encountered except
those who were actively engaged in the work.</p>

<p>"On January 8, 1897, the corporation as organized and a board of eleven
directors elected. For nearly a year these directors met weekly, and much
of the most important preliminary work as accomplished. Resolutions from
commercial bodies, cities and States favoring the Exposition and requesting
national recognition and a federal appropriation were secured in large numbers.
Preliminary appropriations by the States of Iowa and Louisiana were made, and
finally through the efficient efforts of our representatives in Congress, Government
recognition as secured, pledging an appropriation of $200,000 for a federal
building and an exhibit.</p>

<p>"This achievement as the turning point in the history of the enterprise and
settled in the minds of many, who had been doubters before, that the Exposition
would be a reality. Soliciting committees were organized and more than $350,000
of the stock subscriptions and donations were secured.</p>

<p>"In deference to the wishes of the new contributors, the articles of association
were amended and an enlarged board of fifty directors as elected on December 1, 1896. The work as then divided into seven departments, two of which
were afterwards consolidated. The managers of these departments constitute
the Executive Committee. For some months after this organization as perfected
the Executive Committee met twice a week, but for more than a year past this
committee has held daily sessions, and its members have devoted their valuable

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.486.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.486.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.486.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

time and business experience without compensation to the enormous details of
the organization. The magnitude of the business done by this committee can not
be appreciated by those not familiar with the details of the management of great
enterprises of this character.</p>

<p>"The sessions of the committee have not always been harmonious, but differences have been adjusted, and in nearly every instance measures have passed
by unanimous vote. The splendid business management of this Exposition is
largely due to the careful attention to all important matters by the entire committee. Every dollar of the funds of the Exposition has been expended under
authority voted by this committee, and while the plan of organization has been
criticised by some, the results attained speak volumes in its praise. No single
individual could have given the attention to the affairs of the enterprise that they
have received by the department managers.</p>

<p>"Something of the details of the Ways and Means, Publicity and Promotion
and Transportation Departments has been given by their respective managers, who
have already addressed you today. Of the work done by the other departments
shall speak briefly.</p>

<p>"One of the greatest achievements of this Exposition has been the beauty
and convenience of the grounds and buildings. The manager of this department
brought into practical service his successful business training, and to his capacity
for details much of the success of his department is due. He knew no business
hours, but at all times, both day and night for weeks and months, he devoted
himself to the work at hand. One of the first recommendations made by this
department as the change of location from Miller Park to the present site. The
wisdom of this change is conceded by all. To the convenience and accessibility of
the present location much of the beauty of the Exposition and its financial success
is due.</p>

<p>"In the selection of the great artists, whose architecture, landscaping and if
electrical effects have been the admiration of all visitors, the manager of this
department displayed great wisdom. It is conceded by all that to the architects-in-chief we are indebted for more words of praise of our Exposition than to any other
source. Their beautiful groupings and splendid designs of buildings and grounds
have on for them a world-wide and lasting fame. The work of all the other
architects who planned the buildings as of the highest order, and each design
a masterpiece. The landscape-gardening has been a surprise and pleasure to
all. The trees, the flowers and even the grass seemed to grow under the supervision of the architect as by magic. The arrangement of the vines and plants,
the walks and drives, have made the grounds a veritable garden of beauty. No
words of praise can repay the pleasure that this great artist has given to hundreds
of thousands who have admired his beautiful design.</p>

<p>"One of the crowning features of this Exposition, and one which has
excelled all other Expositions in the World's history, has been its electrical effects.
To the designer and his able assistant, the superintendent of electricity, the
Exposition is indebted for the wonderment and surprise expressed by all who

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.487.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.487.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.487.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

have witnessed the magnificent spectacle of the Grand Court at night. The
buildings and exhibits will fade in memory, but who can ever forget the inspirations and impressions produced by the illuminations which at night glorified each turret, spire and dome.</p>

<p>"But the work of these great men would have gone for naught but for the
careful attention and business sagacity displayed in minor details. Leases from
hundreds of owners of the grounds were secured, contracts for buildings and
improvements were made, and only those who witnessed the chaos that existed
here as late as April, 1897, can appreciate the magnitude of the work accomplished by this department. The first ground as broken April 27, 1897, a little more than a year before the gates were opened to an admiring world. The contract for the first building was awarded on July 19, 1897, but between that time and the completion of construction no less than 110 buildings and structures, large and small, were erected by this department at a total cost of $565,034, and the total expenditure up to date by this department has been $1,053,064.34.</p>

<p>"A fire and police department as organized, which, under the able direction
of our city chief, has saved from destruction this beautiful white city on several we occasions. A medical department as provided which has served no less than 1,973 patients during the Exposition. A sanitary department as established
whose efficient service has been attested by the cleanliness of the grounds and
buildings. But I must not dell longer on the work of this important department
and the efficient services rendered by its manager and his assistants.</p>

<p>"The Exhibits Department had a stupendous responsibility to gather from
the States of the West and all parts of the world the products of soil and mine
and factory to fill these beautiful buildings when completed. The manager of this department had many obstacles to overcome, as it as early decided that owing to the necessity of financial aid a space charge from all exhibits would be made. But for the tact and ability of the manager and his able superintendent, the splendid financial showing of the Exposition could not be made today. No less than $190,716 has been collected and conveyed to the treasury for exhibit space by this department. Something of the magnitude of the work performed can be conceived when I say that 4,062 separate exhibits were made and forty States and ten foreign countries were represented.</p>

<p>"To gather these exhibits and install them to the satisfaction of all interested parties as a task which could not have been performed by anyone of less ability than the able manager of this department. In many instances these exhibits have excelled all others at previous Expositions. The livestock show as conceded by all to be the finest collection of animals ever exhibited. There were 2,692 entries, while at the World's Fair there were but 1,842. The agricultural exhibit is pronounced the best that has ever been made, while the mineral exhibit excels any other of the mineral products of the territory represented. The Government exhibit here is also the best this nation has ever displayed, and it has been admired and praised by all.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.488.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.488.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.488.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"The space at the disposal of this department did not permit of exhibits that would compare in magnitude and number to the World's Fair at Chicago, but in point of excellence, variety and careful selection, the exhibits of this Exposition have never been excelled. The enormous details in the allotment of space, the adjustment of conflicting interests, the selection of juries of award, and the gathering from the Art Galleries of the world the choice specimens which make up the splendid exhibit of the Fine Arts building, have engaged the time, energy and ability of the able manager of this department.</p>

<p>"The manager of the Concessions Department has performed duties with
signal ability, tact and discretion. He has had to deal with a class of professional
showmen, who have ever been on the alert to secure all the advantages possible for
the least compensation they could induce him to accept. Many difficulties and
vexatious problems have arisen which have taxed his splendid business ability
to the utmost. No higher praise could be given to any man than is accorded to
him in the acknowledged fact that in every instance he has protected the interests
of the Exposition in exacting from concessionaires the full value of the privilege
granted, and has collected from them nearly every dollar they agreed to pay.
Both he and his worthy superintendent have ever been on the alert to protect the
interests of the Exposition, and the efficiency of the work of this department is
shown by the financial results attained. No less than $276,112 has been received
from concessions, which, compared with like receipts from other Expositions,
proves that fewer mistakes have been made and better results attained than at
any other Exposition ever held in this country. To hundred and forty-five concessions were awarded by this department, and the Midway at this Exposition has
excelled the amusement features of all other smaller Expositions and almost
been equal in point of excellence to that of the great World's Fair. The orderly
manner in which all concessions have been conducted, the small number of cases
of litigation and the general satisfaction to the public this feature of our Exposition has given, commend the wisdom in the selection of the manager who has
attained these results.</p>

<p>"Serious problems of finance have engaged the ability and ingenuity of the
Ways and Means Committee. Under this department the general finances of the
Exposition have been conducted. I can not pass this opportunity to express
appreciation of the most valuable services of the general secretary. while he has
received a moderate salary for his services, he has known no hours of recreation
or rest. On many occasions I have found him at work at midnight, and to his
great watchfulness on all occasions is due much of our success. The manager
of this department has organized and conducted the bureau of gates and admissions, the bureau of music and special attractions, and to his efficient work the
public is indebted for many of the high-class musical and spectacular features
which have been an important element in the entertainment of all.</p>

<p>"The manager of the Publicity and Promotion Department has detailed in his
address the enormous work accomplished in advertising the Exposition and promoting all of its departments throughout the country. while the war seriously

impeded the work of this department for a time, no one well informed denies if
that Omaha and the Exposition are no well known throughout the entire nation.</p>

<p>"To the Transportation Department we are indebted for the low rate secured
for exhibits and excursions, Its manager, by his experience in transportation
affairs, has always been able properly to present the wishes of the Exposition to
the railway officials, on whose generosity we, from the start, relied for much of
our patronage; and while the rates secured have not always been satisfactory, I
doubt if the results could have been as great in the hands of a less experienced
and able man.</p>

<p>"To one and all of these managers, who have served from the beginning
without compensation, this community owes a debt which can never be paid, and
while it is usual for the credit of a great battle to be given to the general of the
war, in many instances, as with this Exposition, this credit is equally due to the
efficient services of his assistants and to the common soldiers, which includes
nearly every representative citizen in this community, for all have worked with
one purpose to build up this enterprise and bring it to the large measure of success it has attained. This Exposition has been an object lesson of great value to
this community. It has illustrated what can be accomplished by standing together
as one man in all matters of common interest. Too much time and energy has
been spent in the past in seeking to destroy the influence of men who were
willing to work for the public good, and the result of this great achievement
should bring into closer union the business men of this city in the upbuilding of
what in the next few years must be one of the great commercial centers of the 
world.</p>

<p>"An important work has been done by the women of this State in the bureau
of education. No less than 64 meetings, many of them of national importance, 
have been held here under the auspices of their organization. Men and women 
of world-wide reputation have been brought here to discuss the great social,
political, economic and religious topics of the day, and future history will record
many of the able discussions on these subjects. The bureau of entertainment as
well conducted by the ladies of this city, and has been a feature of the Exposition
that has pleased thousands of visitors who have partaken of the hospitality of the
well-ordered rooms provided for its functions.</p>

<p>"But I can not enumerate the faithful services of all those deserving praise
for their work.</p>

<p>"When the Exposition was completed and our gates were opened, special days
and special programs were found necessary to interest all classes. No less than
143 special days were arranged, all of greater or less importance, each one bringing its quota of visitors who might not have come but for the special features of their day. Public ceremonies bringing into service many of the best orators of the land were arranged. The culminating event of the year, the "Peace Jubilee" week, alone witnessed six successful celebrations in which the most distinguished men of the nation participated. It has been my humble duty since the opening of the Exposition to arrange these special days, to meet and entertain the thousands of prominent guests who have been present, and to satisfy, as well as my

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.490.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.490.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.490.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

abilities would permit, the exacting requirements of visitors and of the thousands connected in every capacity with the affairs of the Exposition. In these duties have been assisted by the general manager, who by his special fitness for the work has made many friends for the Exposition.</p>

<p>"For my work I claim no special credit. As a citizen of this community
have simply discharged my duty. We rom the start I saw a great opportunity to
promote the welfare of all the people of this city and of the entire West. My
expectation has been realized, and I shall retire from the office, with which the stockholders and directors of this Exposition have honored me, with the consciousness that my every act has been inspired by pure motives, and that my
best efforts have been given at all times during evil and good report for the
success of the enterprise and for the greatest good that could be brought out of it for the community, the State and the country it has advertised in a manner as never before to the world.</p>

<p>"To this city this Exposition has been like a rain in a drouth. It has put new life and energy in all our business interests, in the clearings of our banks, in the business of our merchants; to the values of our real estate, to the fabrics of our factories, it has brought a new and life-giving influence. Our people have forgotten the evils of panic and depression in the enjoyment of the beauties and pleasures so abundant on these grounds. To the State and to the entire West it has given a new standing among the people of the East and far-away countries, which will influence immigration and investment in all future years. The greatest benefits are still to come, when visitors from less favored climes have time to think of, and publish the good impressions they have received of the country represented here. The future historians of the West will record great impetus given in the development of all departments of its industries by this Exposition.</p>

<p>"We celebrate today its closing scene. The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition can never be repeated, and while I bid God-speed to any new we company of enterprising men who under some other name or title may bring new features here next year, I sincerely hope that the lustre of our assured success will not be dimmed by any less important and successful subsequent event.</p>

<p>"But I must pass on and speak of the financial condition of this corporation
in which more than 6,500 of our enterprising citizens are interested. No subscriber or donor, large or small, expected to receive back much, if any, of his contribution in dollars and cents. The money necessary to promote this enterprise as largely subscribed by residents or corporations directly interested in Omaha. It as given from the purses of the poor as well as the rich, and when once placed in the treasury of this corporation it became to me a sacred trust and in its use the members of the Executive Committee have guarded it with jealous care. Since it became evident that a surplus would be left after the gates were finally closed, numerous propositions have been made and various agencies and individuals have endeavored to divert this surplus to other public enterprises, foreign to the objects of the corporation to which it belongs. A horde of clamoring claimants seek to divide the spoils, but to one and all a deaf ear has been

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.491.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.491.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.491.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

turned, and whatever is left after the debts and obligations are discharged will be sacredly returned to the men and women who contributed to the enterprise in its
time of need.</p>

<p>"To me, and I am sure to each member of the Executive Committee, it will
be the proudest moment in our lives when we can pay back, as we hope to do,
every dollar subscribed to the stock of this Exposition. No fears need be entertained by those who have entrusted us with this sacred fund, that it will not be honestly handled in the future as it has been in the past. Not one dollar can be donated to the men whose efforts could not be compensated with money, and who have guarded the interests of this Exposition since its conception. Not one dollar will be diverted to any other purpose foreign to this organization. I favor the publication of a true history of this great achievement, and have appointed a committee of honorable men, whose capacity and integrity can not be questioned, to prepare and publish this proud record, which is not the achievement of any individual or set of men, but is the culmination of the efforts and sacrifices, and of the energy and enterprise of all who have participated in its conception or triumphal progress. But the publication of the history may not eventually cost the Exposition a dollar. The first edition of the history of the Tennessee Centennial, a respectable volume of 500 pages, cost $4,000, and was sold in advance of publication at a profit of $1,000. A fund has been set aside for the payment of a history of this Exposition, but this money will not be wasted, and in my opinion the larger part will be returned to the treasury when the work has been published and sold.</p>

<p>"I have carefully compiled a statement of the present financial condition of
this corporation, but bare figures are generally uninteresting, and I will summarize as follows:</p>

<span class="lg tally">

<span class="l">The total donations collected to that day ............................ 163,070.20</span>

<div class="milestone section"> </div>

<span class="l">Would still leave available ................................. $356,011.46</span></span>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.492.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.492.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.haynes.1910.492.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"I estimate that the salvage and earnings from gates and concessions will
pay expenses of cleaning the grounds, and closing the business after November 1.</p>

<p>"It is estimated that of the $291,909.04 paid on account of stock subscriptions, $20,000 represents partial payments, leaving at this date about $271,909.04 paid up stock. What will be done for those stock subscribers who have not paid up in full is a matter for future determination. In any event the collectible subscriptions will more than pay any sum that may be found due them.</p>

<p>"Deducting estimated paid-up stock, $271,909.04, from available assets, would leave for contingent liabilities $84,102.42, which, it would seem, as sufficient to cover all possible claims of every character. </p>

<p>"If these estimates are correct, it will be seen that we will be able to pay our stockholders in full, and this is what we hope to do. But in order to protect the corporation from all possible liabilities, I shall recommend to the directors that an immediate dividend of fifty per cent be declared and paid without delay to the stockholders of record this day.</p>

<p>"I trust this showing may be as satisfactory to the stockholders and patrons
of this Exposition as it is to those who have been entrusted with its management.</p>

<p>"I desire to express my sincere appreciation of the hearty co-operation I have received from the private citizens of this community, from all who have participated in the Exposition from other States, and especially from the board of fifty directors who have honored and assisted me in a manner unusual in public enterprises. By this co-operation and by the efficient services of the managers of the departments a grand result has been achieved, which will stand out in the history of the West as the crowning feature in its fifty years of growth and development." </p>

<p>After the exercises a banquet as served in the café to the officers of the
Exposition, city and county officials, members of the Board of Education, the
executive committee of the Commercial Club, the board of governors of the
Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, and many other prominent citizens of Omaha who had,
one and all, lent their aid to the no assured success of the Exposition. Numerous toasts were responded to by the guests of the officers of the Exposition. Many words of praise were spoken of their efforts and regrets expressed that the beautiful white City with all its enchantment as so soon to be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>In the evening grand spectacular fireworks were witnessed by many thousands, after which a Grand Carnival on the streets of the Midway as held, and not until 12 o'clock, when the lights for the last time went out on the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition did the crowds disperse.</p>
