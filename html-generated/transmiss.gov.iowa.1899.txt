<p>Report ot the Iowa Trains Mississippi and International Exposition Commission.</p> 

<p>INTRODUCTORY.</p> 

<p>By SMITH H. MALLORY, President.</p> 

<p>To His Excellency, Leslie M. Shaw, Governor of Iowa:</p> 

<p>The Twenty-Sixth Genei-al Assembly provided for a Commission or Exhibit Committee for the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, and made a preliminary appropriation of ten thousand dollars by the following Act:</p> 

<p>"Chapter 149, Laws of the Twenty-Sixth General Assembly.</p> 

<p>AN ACT to provide for an exhibit of the resources of the State of Iowa at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in the year 1898.</p> 

<p>WHEREAS, Congress has passed a bill authorizing and encouraging the holding of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition at the city of Omaha, in the state of Nebraska, in the year 1898; and,</p> 

<p>WHEREAS, It is very desirable that the agricultural, mineral, mechanical, industrial and educational, and every resource and advantage of the State of Iowa shall be creditably represented in such Exposition; therefore.</p> 

<p>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Iowa:</p> 

<p>Section 1. That the Executive Council be and is hereby authorized and 
directed to appoint an exhibit commission to be known as the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition committtee. Such commission shall consist of eleven members, to be selected one from each congressional 
district in the State, not more than six of whom shall be from 
the same political party, and shall have full power to devise and execute 
plans for the said exhibit herein contemplated, and take charge of the same 
and dispose of the appropriations. It may appoint such officers as it in its 
judgment may deem necessary for the carrying out of the purposes of this 
act, including the right to delegate to the exhibit committee the duty and 
power to execute all or any plans that may be devised or ordered by said 
commission. One member thereof shall be chosen to act as treasurer and 
who shall be ex-ofRcio custodian of the moneys herein appropriated, but 
before entering upon the duties of such office he shall furnish a bond subject to the approval of the Executive Council, and in favor of the State of Iowa, in a penal sum equal to the amount herein appropriated. Any vacancy occurring in such Commission shall be filled by the Executive Council by a choice of some citizen residing in the congressional district 
wherein such vacancy occurs.</p> 

<p>The commission herein created shall serve without compensation.</p> 

<p>Sec. 2. The sum of ten thousand dollars is hereby appropriated out of 
any monev in the state treasury, not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of carrying into execution the intent of this act. All payments of money must be made upon complete vouchers and under conditions to be 
fixed bv said commission. At the close of its services the commission shall 
make to the governor a statement of its proceedings, which shall include a 
list of all disbursements with complete vouchers therefor. Provided, 
further, no appointment under this act shall be made, nor shall any money 
herein appropriated be drawn or any charge or expense made until it is 
definitelv known that Congress has made a substantial appropriation for the 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.018.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.018.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.018.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. Provided, further, that said commission shall be restricted in expenses to the sum herein appropriated, and no contracts shall be made or money expended except upon approval of the Executive Council.</p> 

<p>Approved April 17, 1896.</p> 

<p>The Commission was appointed by the Executive Council of State under 
this Act. The law provides that the Executive Council of State should supervise the expenditure of money by the Commission, and the plans for expenditure of any and all funds appropriated by the State should be approved by the executive Council before money could be expended. The 
Commission take this opportunity to express their thanks to the Executive 
Council of State for their kindly advice and co-operation and for their uniform courtesy and approval of their work.</p> 

<p>The Commission met at the Capitol on call of Governor Francis M. 
Drake for organization on the 27th of May, 1897. Ten members of the commission were present and qualified. A. W. Erwin, of the Eleventh district, 
was not able to be present on account of other duties, and has not since that 
time qualified as commissioner or attended any of the ineetings of the Commission. At this first session officers were elected and rules for the government of the Commission were adopted.</p> 

<p>The second session of the Commission was held in Council Bluffs, and 
was invited by Gurdon W. Wattles, President, to confer with the Board of 
Management of the Exposition. At that conference the scope of the exposition was fully discussed and we became satisfied that they had the matter 
well in hand and sufficient capital at their disposal to insure the ultimate 
success of their great enterprise. After the conference the commission, accompanied by the President and members of the Executive Committee of 
the Board of Management of the Exposition, visited the exposition grounds.</p> 

<p>The Commission at this session appointed a committee to prepare an 
address to the people of the State; a sub-committee to prepare estimates 
deemed necessary for a creditable exhibit of the I'esources and industries 
of Iowa and to consult architects in regard to plans for state building and 
cost of the same and report at the next session of the commission. It also 
assigned members of the Commission to take charge of different departments of the State exhibit.</p> 

<p>The Congress of the United States recognized the Trans-Mississippi and 
International Exposition and made a liberal appropriation therefor. The 
City of Omaha and the State of Nebraska made large contributions to aid 
the project. It was not only necessary to make a large contribution to aid 
it required courage and almost superhuman energy to build and carry 
forward to a successful termination a great exposition more than one thousand miles from the seaboard and in the heart of the new but vast territory 
lying west of the Mississippi river. The grand success of the Exposition 
is largely due to the hard work and able management of President Gurdon 
W. Wattles and his efficient contemporaries.</p> 

<p>The Twenty-Seventh General Assembly made an additional appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars, thus placing a total of thirty-five 
thousand dollars at the disposal of the Iowa Commission. The Commission 
realized that to creditably represent all the varied industries of the state 
it would require a much larger sum and wisely decided not to enter into 
competition with the other states and territories in all the different departments, but first erect and maintain a comfortable home for Iowa visitors 
and their friends, and make the best possible showing of our leading industries,</p> 

<p>At a subsequent session it was found necessary to appoint a suitable 
person as General Superintendent to take charge of the work.</p> 

<p>The results are fully set forth in the reports of the Superintendent and 
Secretary and the Commissioners in charge of the several departments.</p>

<p>Address to the People of the State.</p> 

<p>To the People of the State of Iowa:</p> 

<p>Iowa being the pivotal state of those embraced in the wide territory 
known as the Trans-Mississippi as regarcis wealth, enterprise, education, and 
all that goes to make a great state, the people of Iowa are especially interested in the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, to be held in 
Omaha in 1898. This Exposition will be held for the purpose of exhibiting 
the products, manufactures, arts and industries of the twenty-four states 
and territories included in the Trans-Mississippi belt. It has been nationalized by act of Congress, and aided by a liberal appropriation.</p> 

<p>The Twenty-Sixth General Assenibly of Iowa passed "An Act to provide 
for an exhibit of the resources of the state at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in the year 1898," which was approved by the Governor April 17th, 1896. The Commission appointed under 
this act asks your co-operation in carrying out the expressed intent—"that 
the agricultural, mechanical, industrial, educational, and every resource and 
advantage of the state of Iowa be creditably represented."</p> 

<p>At the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 Iowa took the gold 
medal on farm and dairy products. At the World's Fair in Chicago, Iowa 
made an exhibit of her agricultural, horticultural, dairy and live stock interests that did great credit to the state. All the world knows of Iowa and its 
agricultural wealth and possibilities. The world also knows that in point of 
education, Iowa leads.</p> 

<p>The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition will afford an opportunity that has not hitherto been presented to Iowa, not only to advertise 
her agricultural wealth, but also to show the possibilities of developing a 
great manufacturing state. The coal fields of Iowa are sufficient to run all 
the manufacturing interests of the entire Northwest. The water power 
still undeveloped, is unsurpassed in the West.</p> 

<p>Experimental tests of sugar beets in Iowa have shown beyond question 
the possibility of making beet sugar oneof the leading industries of the state</p> 

<p>Take as a basis a commercial point in Iowa, draw a circle taking in a 
radius of two hundred miles, and you will And more railroads and river outlets for commerce than in the same extent of territory any place in the 
world. But the Iowa cattle and hog producer must at present find his market in Chicago. The farmer w'ho depends upon the sale of grain for the 
profits of his farm, either directly or indirectly, finds his market east or 
south of the borders of his own state. The Iowa wool grower ships his clip 
to the eastern seaboard. Iowa has not risen to her opportunities.</p> 

<p>Capital is necessary for success in new fields of industry; Iowa has capital, and Iowa capital should be used in developing the latent resources of the 
far-famed agricultural and dairy state, and in building up home markets. 
Foreign capital would naturally be drawn by the magnate, "faith at home," 
and Iowa, with her vast agricultural resources and her own artisans, would 
supply her own people and the world with finished goods, and would indeed 
become the pride of the Trans-Mississippi group of states.</p> 

<p>This Exposition can be made a source of profit to Iowa beyond all computation. The time is now ripe for investment in new lines. There has never 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.020.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.020.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.020.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

before been a time in the history of the country when there was so much idle 
capital as there is today. Idle capital means idle laborers. Iowa should form a 
working ground for these mutual interests. The capitalist and laborer can 
join hands in Iowa and develop the natural and latest resources of the state 
to an extent" heretofore undreamed of.</p> 

<p>Money is necessary to make an exhibit that will do credit to the state 
Only $10,000 has been appropriated. It will require $50,000 more to do the 
work at all creditably. The farmers and stockmen cannot afford the expense of an exhibit without the aid of the state. The same is true in other 
departments.</p> 

<p>State interest as well as state pride calls for a requisite appropriation. 
The Exposition will be held at our western border, and Iowa will receive a 
large part of the direct benefit which falls to the country immediately surrounding any great exhibition. It is probable that Iowa will reap as much 
direct benefit fi'om eastern travel and transportation as will Nebraska.</p> 

<p>The Commissioners appeal to all the people to join in making an exhibit 
that will bring pi-actical results, and expect that those engaged in agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, manufacturing, and all other industrial lines 
of work will at once begin preparation for the exhibit.</p> 

<p>The liberal arts department should make an exhibit commensui-ate with 
the vast sums of money the state is expending for the education and elevation of its people. Fine arts and the department of women's work should be 
especially successful in this Exposition.</p> 

<p>Please address the commissioner of the department in which you wish to 
exhibit. On all general matters, address the secretary of the Commission.</p> 

<p>SYLVANUS D. COOK, Chairman,</p> 
<p>Committee. ROBERT H. MOORE,</p>

<p>Report ot the Executive Committee of the Iowa Trans-Mississippi Exposition Commission.</p> 

<p>We have the honor to report briefly the work assigned to and the results accomplished by the Executive Committee. For information in detail, 
reference is had to the minutes of all the sessions of the Executive Committee, which are already a matter of record.</p> 

<p>ORGANIZATION.</p> 

<p>The act creating the Commission gave to them authority to delegate its 
powers wholly or in part to an executive or exhibit committee. The rules 
adopted by the Commission at their first session provided for an Executive 
Committee of three, but did not confer upon them full power to act. At a 
subsequent session when it was definitely known what amount of funds 
would be at the disposal of the Commisssion, the amount being considerably 
less than was asked for and deemed necessary for a creditable showing of 
Iowa's resources, and as frequent meetings of the Commission would be expensive, in the interest of economy (not because the members of the Commission were unwilling to devote their time) ai the third session of the Commission Rule VII, referring to the Executive Committee was rescinded and 
the following rule substituted in lieu thereof:</p> 

<p>"Article VII.— There shall be an Executive Committeee consisting of five 
members of the Commission. Three shall be appointed by the president, and 
the President and Secretary of the Commission shall be ex-offlcio members. 
Such committeee shall serve during the pleasure of the Commission and perform such duties and execute such plans as may be devised or ordered by the 
Commission."</p> 

<p>Under the new Article VII, the following persons constitute the Executive 
Committee: S. B. Packard, S. H. Mallory, S. D. Cook, R. H. Moore, F. N. 
Chase.</p> 

<p>Commissioner Markley offered the following resolution and moved its 
adoption:</p> 

<p>"Whereas, It will be necessary to use the utmost economy in the expenditure of the funds appropriated by the state for the Trans-Mississippi and 
International Exposition, to be held in Omaha, June to November, 1898, in order to accomplish the best results and make the most creditable exhibit of the 
products of the state, and</p> 

<p>"Whereas, The frequent meetings of the Cojnmission are expensive and 
constantly reduces the limited appropriation made by the state, and</p> 

<p>"Whereas, The law under which this Commission is appointed gives 
this Commission the right to delegate to an Executive or Exhibit Committee 
the duty and power to execute all or any plans that may be devised or ordered by the Commission, and</p> 

<p>"Whereas, The work to be done will require immediate and constant attention; therefore,</p> 

<p>"Resolved, 1st, That all the duties, and power to execute all or any plans 
that are now, or may hereafter be devised or ordered by this Commission be, 
and the same are hereby delegated to the Executive or Exhibit Committee, 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.022.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.022.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.022.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

with full power to act in the premises, at all times when this Board is not 
in actual session; and</p>

<p>"Resolved, 2nd, That the secretary of this Commission be, and is hereby 
required to keep an accurate record of all proceedings of the Executive or Exhibit Committee, and report the same to this Commission, to be preserved as 
a part of the proceedings of said Commission." Adopted.</p> 

<p>On motion of Commissioner Cook, S. B. Packard was elected chairman 
of the Executive Committee.</p> 

<p>At the fourth session of the Commission, on motion, the following resolution was adopted:</p> 

<p>"Whereas, F. N. Chase has so ably and satisfactorily discharged the duties of secretary of this Commission ever since its organization without compensation; and</p> 

<p>"Whereas, This Commission does not think it just that he should continue without being compensated; and</p> 

<p>"Whereas, The interests of the cause demand the entire services of a competent man as secretary and general superintendent, but as the law does 
not permit of the selection of any member of this Commission as an officer 
with pay; therefore, be it</p> 

<p>"Resolved, That Mr. Chase be requested by this Commission to resign as 
commissioner in order that he may accept the position of secretary and general superintendent; and,</p> 

<p>"Resolved, further. That his compensation be fixed at a salary of one hundred and twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month and necessary expenses, 
subject to the approval of the Executive Council of the State."</p> 

<p>Upon request of Commissioner Chase of the Third district, the Executive 
Council accepted his resignation. Mr. Chase then accepted the position of 
superintendent and secretary and continued the work.</p> 

<p>At the fourth session of the Commission, upon the resignation of F. N. 
Chase as a member of the Commission, the following resolutions were 
adopted:</p> 

<p>Commissioner Moore moved that the vacancy on the Executive Committee created by the resignation of F. N. Chase be filled by the election of Commissioner J. E. E. Markley. Seconded by Commissioner Lovejoy.</p> 

<p>Commissioner Lovejoy moved that new Article VII. be amended by striking out the words "three shall be appointed by the president and the president and secretary of the Commission shall be ex-ofl3cio members," and inserting in lieu thereof the words "the president of the Commission shall be 
ex-offcio a member thereof."</p> 

<p>Under those resolutions your Comnittee undertook the work, having full 
authority to act in all matters at all times when the Commission was not in 
session. Nine sessions of the Executive Committee have been held. Plans 
were devised from time to time and instructions were given to the superintendent, who had been appointed by the Commission to take charge of the 
work under the direction of the Executive Committee and their plans and instructions were ably and faithfully carried out by him.</p> 

<p>PRELIMINARY WORK.</p> 

<p>At second session of the Commission, Commissioners S. B. Packard and 
F. N. Chase were appointed as a sub-committee to prepare estimates, and 
Commissioner Packard was appointed a committee of one to visit Omaha and 
confer with the Board of Management in reference to location for State 
Building and in regard to free space foi State Collective Exhibits in the several exposition buildings.</p> 

<p>Your sub-committee secured plans from the Josselyn &amp; Taylor Co., architects, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for State building, without expense to the Commission, and after careful consideration and consultation with competent 
men representing the leading industries of our state, prepared the following 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.023.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.023.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.023.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

schedule of estimates for State building and for a creditable representation of 
the resources of the state and for the necessary expenses of administration. 
The total of these estimates amounted to $57,400.00; $10,000.00 had been already appropriated, leaving $47,400.00 to be appropriated. The several amounts were deemed to be reasonable and necessary for a satisfactory and profitable 
participation with the other states and territories at the Trans-Mississippi 
and International Exposition and were approved by the Commission and 
Executive Council of State. It was decided to ask the General Assembly to 
make an additional appropriation in accordance with these estimates.</p> 

<p>Report of Sub-Committee on Estimates.</p>

<p>SPACE.</p> 

<p>Commissioner Packard, as Committee to procure space, found no easy 
task, and was obliged to have a number of interviews with the Board of 
management of the Exposition. In some of these he had the valuable aid 
of Senator N. M. Pusey and Hon. Geo. F. Wright, vice-president of the 
Exposition for Iowa.</p> 

<p>The plans of the Board of Management were to charge all states the sum of fifty cents per square foot for space for collective exhibits and State Building and one dollar per square foot for individuals or firms making exhibits. It was estimated that we would need from eight to ten thousand square feet of space and that amount was asked for, and at the 
close of the negotiations we were successful in securing free space for the Iowa State Building on the bluff tract, and 2,400 square feet in the Exposition Buildings, as follows: 1,200 square feet in the Horticultural Building, and 1,200 square feet in the Agricultural Building. Central and desirable locations were assigned in these buildings to the Iowa Commission.</p> 

<p>When this result was reported to the Commission it was decided that we would make no attempt to install exhibits in any buildings except where free space was granted, and at the close of the session of the General Assembly, when it was definitely known that the amount asked for had been

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.025.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.025.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.025.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

reduced to $25,000.00, it became necessary to modify all the plans and make arrangements for the preparation of exhibits on a smaller scale, and prepare new plans for a State Building that might be erected within the limit of eight thousand dollars, that amount being designated by the General Assembly for that purpose.</p> 

<p>It was the unanimous opinion of the Commission and the Executive 
Council that in whatever departments we exhibited the products of Iowa, 
it should be well done; the installation should be of the best, and not make 
an attempt to exhibit in all the departments, and thereby fail to attract 
creditable attention and notice to any of Iowa's exhibits.</p> 

<p>A conference was had with the Executive Council of State, and a committee consisting of Hon. John Herriott Treasurer of State, representing the 
State Executive Council, and J. E. E. Markley, representing the Commission, was appointed, and after due deliberation they reported to the Commission the following as the best possible distribution of the funds at the 
disposal of the Commission. Their report was unanimously adopted by the 
Commission and approved by the Executive Council.</p> 

<p>MODIFIED ESTIMATES.</p> 

<p>The following report in the form of a resolution was submitted to the 
Commission April 4th, 1898, as report of a conference of a joint committee 
of the Executive Council of State and the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Commission, by the Committee, Hon. John. Herriott, member 
of the Committee for the Executive Council of State, and Hon. J. E. E. 
Markley, member of Committee from the Commission:</p>

<p>This apportionment is subject to change by the joint action of the Executive Committee, or Commission, and the Executive Council. 
On motion, the report and resolution was adopted.</p> 

<p>CONSTRUCTION.</p> 

<p>The time intervening between the final action of the General Assembly in 
regard to an appropriation and the opening of the Exposition being so short, 
made it necessary to act with promptness in regard to the erection of a state 
building. The Commission was immediately called together, the revised plans 
were subinitted and approved, bids were asked for and proposals for the erection of the Iowa Building were advertised in the leading papers as follows:</p> 

<p>PROPOSALS FOR THE ERECTION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE IOWA BUILDING AT THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION AT OMAHA, NEB.</p> 

<p>Sealed proposals must be received by F. N. Chase, Secretary, addressed in 
the care of A. E. Shipley, Secretary of the Executive Council, Des Moines, 
Iowa, on or before 2 oclock p. m. of the 19th day of April, 1898, and opened 
at the office of the Executive Council as above at 2 p. m. of said day, for all 
the labor and materials required for the construction as set forth in the 
specifications for said building, in accordance with the drawings and specifications, copies of which may be seen on and after the 12th day of April, 
1898, at the office of F. N. Chase, Secretary, Cedar Falls; Hon. G. F. Wright, 
Council Bluffs; A. E. Shipley, secretary of the Executive Council, Des 
Moines, or Josselyn &amp; Taylor Co., architects. Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</p> 

<p>Each bid must be accompanied by a certified check for a ?um not less 
than 5 per cent of the proposal. The right is reserved to reject any or all 
bids, to waive any defects or any informality in any bid, if it is deemed in 
the interest of the State to do so.</p> 

<p>Proposals must be enclosed in envelopes and sealed, marked "Proposals 
for construction of the Iowa State Building at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, Omaha, Neb., addressed to the secretary, F. N. Chase, 
in care of A. E. Shipley, secretary of the Executive Council, Des Moines, la.</p> 

<p>By order of the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition 
Commission.</p> 

<p>F. N. CHASE, Secretary.</p> 

<p>At the date named in the proposals, the following bids were received:</p> 

<p>BIDS.</p>

<p>A joint meeting of the Executive Committee and the Executive Council 
was held. The bids were opened and read, but as all of them were in excess 
of the limit named by the General Assembly ($8,000.00), on motion of President Mallory, the letting of the contract was postponed for twenty-four 
hours.</p> 

<p>Architect Josselyn, being present, was asked to still further modify the 
plans, and the Executive Committee immediately called the contractors who 
had submitted bids to examine the modified plans and make new bids. This

could not be accomplished within the time named, and another postponement 
of twenty-four hours was taken.</p> 

<p>When the time came for opening the bids, there were only two submitted. 
These bids were as follows</p> 

<p>Bid No. 1. P. H. Wind of Council Bluffs, Iowa, seven thousand seven 
hundred ninety-five dollars ($7,795.00).</p> 

<p>Bid No. 2. Messrs. Goldie &amp; Sons, Chicago, eight thousand dollars, $8,000.) 
The bid of P. H. Wind of Council Bluffs Iowa, being the lowest and best 
bid, your committee instructed the chairman and secretary to enter into contract with him in accordance with the proposals as advertised.</p> 

<p>Mr. Wind gave satisfactory bonds and immediately commenced the work 
and under the direction of the superintendent and secretary it was hurried 
forward as rapidly as possible in compliance with contract. It was found 
necessary to make some minor alterations, but the work was completed 
within the limit of time named in the contract.</p> 

<p>D. E. Milward was employed to cover the walls with Burlap and make 
other suitable and necessary decorations for installing the exhibit of pictures by Iowa artists and make everything ready for the furniture and furnishings.</p> 

<p>THE IOWA BUILDING.</p> 

<p>The architectural design, as well as the plans and detail drawings, was 
made by the Josselyn &amp; Taylor Co., Architects, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The 
design is Ionic and the effect similar to the picturesque Italian casinos. The 
object to which all their energies were bent was to secure all the out-door 
space possible, hence the large circular porches with graceful pillars supporting a high roof, the whole structure upon a basement elevation of nine 
feet.</p> 

<p>The site upon which the building was erected was in the very heart of 
the beautiful bluff tract and facing Iowa's graceful shores and the high 
bluffs beyond.</p> 

<p>"The building combined two qualities for which the State and its people are noted: substantialness and comfort. On the front of the building 
great porches curved in elliptical form to the north and south from the 
central veranda and invited the weary to rest and comfort.</p> 

<p>The extreme measurements of the building were 152 feet from north to 
south and 113 feet from east to west, of which 78 1-2 feet by 55 1-2 feet composed the building proper, leaving the remainder in facades. The basement 
under the entire building was used for storage.</p> 

<p>On the first floor in the center of the building was a large hall extending from front to rear. In this hall was placed the drinking fountain so 
highly appreciated by all visitors during the whole term of the Exposition. 
On the right of the hall the staircase ascended to the second floor. On the 
front, opening from the porches into the main hall were two large double 
doors on each side of the large bay window. The first room at the right 
was the ladies' parlor, and opening from this the ladies' dressing room 
and toilet. Beyond this and opening from the large hall was the gentlemen's 
parlor and toilet room. On the other side of the hall the first room at the 
front was the Commissioner's rooin. The remainder of that entire side of 
the building was occupied by offices for the Commission, the Superintendent 
and Secretary, a check room, postofflce, and information bureau.</p> 

<p>On the second floor at the front, extending the entire width of the main 
structure was the reading and press room, where many of the newspapers 
of the State, both daily and weekly, were aiwaj'S to oe found. This room 
was also used on special occasions as an assembly room, for representative 
meetings and conventions of the different organizations visiting the Exposition from Iowa. There were also large spaces on either side of the open 
well. In the rear were store rooms and rooms occupied by the janitor, assistant janitor and night watchman.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.028.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.028.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.028.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>From the roof of the building rose the dome and from it the tall flagstaff from which floated the stars and stripes and the bergee with the 
word "Iowa." There were domes at the extreme end of each veranda with 
flagstaff and flag on each. High on the front of the building was the word 
"Iowa," with the figures "1846-1898." Beneath this, the following motto: 
"Our liberties we prize, our rights Ave will maintain."</p> 

<p>Between the Ionic pillars were hanging baskets filled with vines and 
foliage plants, which added much to the artistic effect, and in front of the 
large central porch between the stair-cases there was a huge cornucopia 
formed of foliage plants, having the effect of casting upon the sward beneath a wealth of blooming plants, typical of the blessings bestowed upon 
"her citizens by the state; at the base of this the word "Iowa" in bright 
leaves.. This design was prepared and maintained by J. F. Wilcox, florist, 
of Council Bluffs.</p> 

<p>No competitive exhibits were shown in the building.</p> 

<p>In the press room on the second floor there was an exhibit of Indian 
work by the Indians from the Iowa reservation, and a fine collection of 
photographs prepared by the President and Board of the Iowa Agricultural 
College.</p> 

<p>On the walls of nearly all the rooms was installed an exhibit of the 
handiwork of Iowa artists which served to relieve, to some extent, the unfinished appearance of the walls, and these pictures were greatly admired 
by the thousands of visitors.</p> 

<p>One of the most notable exhibits in the building was the mammoth 
Book, where more than one hundred thousand of Iowa visitors and their 
friends were pleased to register their names. Full description of this wonderful book is given elsewhere.</p> 

<p>The plan adopted by the Iowa Commission that everything about the 
Building should be free to all visitors proved to be a grand feature in the 
administration of the affairs of the Building, especially the check room, 
where thousands of parcels were checked in and out daily, requiring the 
work of two attendants to accommodate all that wished to avail themselves 
of this feature free of expense. Writing tables and writing material were 
furnished in various parts of the building free.</p> 

<p>The Postoffice was also a desirable feature, and it required almost constant attention by one of the assistants. There were three deliveries of 
mail at the Building by the Government letter carriers daily, except Sundays, and many visitors availed themselves of the opportunity of depositing 
and receiving their mail at the Building.</p> 

<p>FURNISHINGS.</p> 

<p>The Building was comfortably though economically furnished. A carload of rattan chairs, rockers and settees, with a large number of wooden 
chairs, sofas and benches, furnished sittings for over five hundred people. 
Cocoa matting extended through the large hall, and all the rooms on the 
first floor were carpeted with Japanese matting and rugs.</p> 

<p>The thanks of the Committee are due to the Rand &amp; Leopold Desk Company, of Burlington, who kindly furnished a carload of their fine office 
desks and tables for the use of the Commission free of expense except the 
freight. The Committee also wish to extend their thanks to the Steinway 
Piano Co., who kindly placed one of their superb Grand Pianos in the parlor of the Building.</p> 

<p>EMPLOYEES,</p> 

<p>A detailed statement in regard to the employees in the State Building 
and other departments is given in the report of the Superintendent and Secretary, and need not be repeated here. They were all selected from Iowa, 
and the number was limited to the actual necessities in order to keep the 
expenaitures in this department within the limit of the amount set apart 
for their maintamance.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.029.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.029.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.029.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>Many hundred applications were received and filed in the office of the 
Secretary with the best endorsements and recommendations from reliable 
citizens of the State. These were carefully considered by the Committee, 
but of course very few of the large number could be chosen.</p> 

<p>Reasonable compensation was agreed upon, and those selected as assistants were to be called whenever their services were needed, and their assignment to the various positions was placed in the hands of Superintendent Chase, and they were at all times to be under his control, subject to the action of the Committee.</p> 

<p>EXPENDITURES.</p> 

<p>Your Committee in considering the needs of all the different departments had to consider carefully the estimate of expenditures for the various departments of work, and the Superintendent was, from time to time, 
requested to exercise economy in order that the expenditures in the different departments might not exceed the appropriation.</p> 

<p>It is with pleasure that we are able to announce that in only one or 
two instances did the amount reach the sum designated for that special purpose, while in many others the amount appropriated was considerably in 
excess of the amount expended.</p> 

<p>SALE OF STATE BUILDING.</p> 

<p>At a meeting of the Executive Committee held in September, Superintendent Chase was instructed to advertise for bids for wrecking the State 
Building, removing the debris, and cleaning the grounds in compliance with 
the rules of the Board of Management of the Exposition. The Superintendent advertised for bids in the Omaha Bee and World-Herald and in the 
Council Bluffs Nonpareil as follows:</p> 

<p>TO CONTRACTORS—FOR SALE.</p> 

<p>The Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission 
offer for sale, to the highest bidder, the Iowa State Building, exclusive of 
the plumbing, situated on the bluff tract. Lot No. 719, Exposition Grounds, 
the bids to include the wrecking or removal of the Iowa State Building and 
leaving the grounds clean or to the satisfaction of the Iowa Commission 
and the Board of Management of the Exposition. All salvage derived from 
said building to become the property of the purchaser. Bids to be opened 
on the 27th of October, at the office of the Secretary, at the Iowa Building, 
at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, the Commission reserving the right to reject any or all bids. For further information, call on the Secretary at the 
Building.</p> 

<p>By Order of the Committee.</p>
<p>S. B. PACKARD, Chairman.</p> 
<p>F. N. CHASE, Secretary."</p> 

<p>Up to the time designated for the opening of the bids only one bid had 
been received, and the opening of the bids was postponed until the 29th 
at which time four bids had been received. On motion, the Secretary was 
requested to open and read the bids.</p> 

<p>Bid No. 1, by A. W. Phelps &amp;. Son, Ninety Dollars ($90.00.)</p> 

<p>Bid No. 2, wants one hundred and fifty dollars paid to him in addition 
to thesalvage.</p>

<p>All of these bids were based upon notice to contractors published in 
the several papers, and all of the bids in compliance with said notice.</p>

cepted
, contract was entered into with them and wrecking of the building commenced soon after the close of the Exposition, the rules of theExposition requiring that the building should be removed on or before Jan. 
1st, 1899.</p> 

<p>The plumbing in the building was also advertised for sale. Only one 
bid was received, offering fifty dollars ($50.00), as it was in place. 
It was afterwards sold for $90.00.</p> 

<p>SALVAGE.</p> 

<p>At the last session of the Executive Committee, held pi-ior to the' close 
of the Exposition, the disposal of the furniture and property belonging tothe Commission was placed in the hands of P. N. Chase, Superintendent 
and Secretary, by the following resolution:</p> 

<p>"Moved by Commissioner Moore that Secretary Chase have full authority to sell all property of the Iowa Commission not already sold or 
otherwise disposed of. Motion adopted."</p> 

<p>A statement of the proceeds from salvage is attached to and made a 
part of the report of the Superintendent and Secretary.</p> 

<p>BENEFITS TO THE STATE AND TO ITS CITIZENS.</p> 

<p>Your Committee fully believe that the State through its Legislature 
acted wisely in planning to participate in this first great western exposition.</p> 

<p>The Exposition had its origin in a representative convention composed 
of intelligent delegates from Iowa and other Trans-Mississippi States and 
Territories, and Omaha was finally selected as the place for holding the 
same. The United States government lent its aid, co-operation and financial support, and the Citizens of Omaha and Nebraska and the trunk line 
railroads by liberal contribution furnished an adequate amount of money, 
without which no exposition could be made a success.</p> 

<p>Notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstance of the Spanish-American 
war, which diverted the attention of all of our citizens, to some extent at 
least, from the arts of Peace, still the Exposition, in its beautiful grounds, 
magnificent buildings, and endless variety of exhibits attracted the attention and admiration of a vast multitude and its success was phenomenal.</p> 

<p>It does not seem, in this intelUgent age, necessary to speak of the benefits of great expositions, especially as to the good done to the Trans-Mississippi country by the recent exhibition at Omaha. If this great valley 
region as a whole has been benefitted, what shall we say of Iowa, on whose 
very borders the exposition was held, making our state the gateway to it 
from the east? In an address on a neighboring State day, when praise 
would naturally be expected to be corfined to the subject of the occasion, 
a distinguished eastern orator said ir substance: "If I had found no such 
an exposition here, the ride I have had across the State of Iowa, would have 
fully repaid me for my trip. "Words cannot picture the scenes spread before me of thriving towns and cities, the vastness of the agricultural section, the high cultivation of the farms, the' wealth of grain and fruit and 
flowers and the herds and flocks I saw. To me it was a revelation, and I 
shall tell the story when I return to hundreds who know not of the greatness of Iowa."</p> 

<p>The same impression formed on the minds of thousands who cross our 
State to Omaha, is worth more in an advertising sense, and will bring more 
material returns to our state than can be expressed in dollars. The education 
given the thousands of lowans who visited the Exposition is also beyond 
financial computation. But even in a strictly business sense it would be 
rash for anyone to deny that within the next few years, all that Iowa appropriated for its exhibit at Omaha will come back to our people many fold.</p> 

<p>The benefits resulting to the west at large and to the State of Iowa and 
its citizens, we believe, will vastly exceed the cost of money and labor and 
will continue to add greatly to the material growth and prosperity of our 
great commonwealth.</p>

<p>In closing this report, the Committee desires to put upon record its 
just appreciation of the satisfactory discharge of the duties imposed upon 
the Superintendent and Secretary, F. N. Chase.</p> 

<p>With the extended acquaintance and thorough knowledge Mr. 
Chase has had in Exposition work, the Committee was sure 
he would see his way plainly, but still the labor devolved 
was more than most men could have done well, when it 
is considered that the contract for the erection of the Iowa State 
Building required its completion in less than fifty working days and that 
this was accomplished under his supervision, and during the same time the 
work of preparing the space and installing the exhibits to be made by the 
Commission in the agricultural and horticultural buildings; these exhibits 
were to be ready for inspection by the opening day of the Exposition, and 
the work of decorating and furnishing the State Building and the preparation for the dedicatory services held June 23d, the care needed in systematizing the work of those who were to be on duty in the Iowa State Building, besides receiving the vast number of people who had business with 
the Commission or found pleasure in the genial social qualities of this 
hard worked official when he was most pressed with his perplexing 
duties, yet always meeting pleasantly and courteously their calls and in no 
Instance forgetting that he belonged to and represented Iowa.</p> 

<p>As Superintendent, Secretary and disbursing agent, his accounts have 
been accurately kept and his vouchers have been found to cover every dollar of expenditures and the careful and economical disbursement of the 
funds entrusted to the Commission meet their expectation and hearty approval.</p> 

<p>His duties as Secretary and Comn:issioner in charge of the work of preparing exhibits for the agricultural and horticultural departments during 
1897 and up to April 1st, 1898, were faithfully discharged without remuneration. After that time for the period of about eight months his duties required him to be away from home and the compensation allowed by the 
committee was in no sense a just recompense for the services rendered 
us.</p> 

<p>THEREFORE, The Executive Committee takes much pleasure in testifying to the value of these services and in tendering its thanks for the 
same.</p> 

<p>Executive Committee.</p>

<p>Report of Superintendent and Secretary.</p> 

<p>By F. N. CHASE.</p> 

<p>To the President and Members of the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission.</p>

<p>Gentlemen: Complying with the following resolution adopted by the Executive Committee of your Commission in session November 1, 1898, I present my report.</p> 

<p>RESOLUTION.</p> 

<p>"Moved by Commissioner Markley that Chairman Packard of the Executive committee, assisted by the secretary, be authorized to make a comprehensive report of the doings of the Executive Committee and the Commisson, to be submitted to the final meeting of the Commission when 
called." Motion adopted.</p> 

<p>REPORT OF SECRETARY.</p> 

<p>The Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission 
was appointed by the Executive Council of state under Chapter one 
hundred forty-nine (145), laws of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly, which 
made a preliminary appropriation of ten thousand dollars ($10,000,00) authorized the appointment of a Commission of eleven by the Executive Council, one from each Congressional district.</p> 

<p>The following persons were appointed:</p> 

<p>First District—JOHN H. WALLBANK, Mt. Pleasant, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Second District—SYLYANUS D. COOK, Davenport. Iowa.</p> 
<p>Third District—FRANK N. CHASE, Cedar Falls, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Fourth District—J. E. E. MARKLEY, Mason City, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Fifth District—S. B. PACKARD, Marshalltown, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Sixth District—ROBERT H. MOORE, Ottumwa, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Seventh District—ALLAN DAWSON, Des Moines, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Eighth District—SMITH H. MALLORY, Chariton, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Ninth District—GEO. W. McCOID, Logan, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Tenth District—OWEN LOVEJOY, Jefferson, Iowa.</p> 
<p>Eleventh District—A. W. ERWIN, Sioux City, Iowa.</p> 

<p>Governor Francis M. Drake called the Commission together for organization Mav 27, 1897, in the Governors leception room at the Capitci. Ten members were present and aualified. Attorney General Ramley administering the oath A. W. Erwin, commissioner appointed from the Eleventh district, was absent, and has never qualified or met with the Commission 
Governor Drake read the law, and after asking the Commission to elect 
their own officers, retired. Organization was perfected.</p> 

<p>The second session of the Commission was held at Council Bluffs, at 
which session the work of the Commission was fully discussed.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.034.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.034.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.034.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>At a subsequent meeting, with the view of lessening the expense of administration, the powers of the Commission were delegated to an Executive 
Committee composed of the following members: S. B. Packard, chairman; 
S. H. Mallory, J. E. E. Markley, R. H. Moore, S. D. Cook. The secretary 
was instructed to keep a complete record of all of the acts of the Executive Committeee and report the same to the Commission.</p> 

<p>The Twenty-seventh General Assembly made additional appropriation 
of the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). The amount asked 
for was forty-seven thousand four hundred dollars ($47,400.00). At the 
fourth session of the Commission, after additional appropriation had been 
made, the scope of the work had to be somewhat modified from the original plans of the Commission, and it was found necessary for some one to take immediate and active charge of the work of the Commission, and 
as the law creating the Commission made no provision for compensation 
for any officer or member of the Commission, and as no competent person 
could devote his entire time to work of this character without compensation, the Commission asked the Executive Council of State to accept the resignation of Commissioner Chase of the Third district, in order that they 
might appoint him as superintendent to take charge of the work, under the 
direction of the Executive Committee. Your secretary tendered his resignation, which was accepted by the Executive Council, and Captain J. F. Merry of Manchester, Iowa, was appointed to fill the vacancy. The Commission then elected Mr. Chase as sup?rintendent and secretary.</p> 

<p>The secretary, who had been discharging the duties of the office without 
compensation from the 27th of May, 1897, to April 4, 1898, and had also had 
charge of, and given personal attention to the securing of exhibits from 
the crop of 1897, accepted the position offered with a determination to exercise the most rigid economy consistent with the best interests of the 
state, and to make the best showing at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition 
that could possibly be made with the amount of money the state had placed 
at the disposal of the Commission.</p> 

<p>For a detailed report as secretary, I call your attention to a complete 
copy of the minutes of all sessions of the Commission and of the Executive 
Committee on file in the oflfice of the se?retary of the Executive Council of 
State. A full and complete financial statement is published herewith.</p> 

<p>SUPERINTENDENT.</p> 

<p>The Commission and the Executive Council of State are entitled to, and 
I herewith submit, a report as superintendent placed in charge of the work 
of the Commission by the resolution above referred to.</p> 

<p>This work is also partly covered by the minutes of the several sessions 
of the Commission and Executive Committee, and need not be repeated in 
this report.</p> 

<p>The most important and immediate work was that of advertising for 
bids for the erection of the State building, the cost of which was limited by 
statute to eight thousand dollars ($8,000.00). After considerable difficulty 
and much delay, contract was entered into with P. H. Wind of Council 
Bluffs, Iowa, for the sum of seven thousand seven hundred ninety-five dollars ($7,795.00), this being the lowest and best bid received by the Executive 
Committee. Work was immediately commenced, and your superintendent 
devoted as much time as possible looking after the construction of the building as supervising architect.</p> 

<p>In the meantime, a joint meeting of the Executive Council of State and 
of the Commission was held in Des Moines and plans agreed upon for the 
disbursement of the funds, believing that the best and most satisfactory results could be obtained by first making a comfortable headquarters for the accommodation of Iowa visitors and their friends and for the necessary offices of the Commission, and then make exhibits representing the leading industries of our state, rather than to go into all departments with an exhi-

bit
 entirely unworthy of our state. The disposition of the funds was made 
by a special committeee, State Treasurer Herriott and Commissioner Markley, appointed at the conference just referred to, and is as follows:</p> 

<p>For State Building $8,000.00 </p>

<p>For furnishing 1,070.00</p> 

<p>For Department of Agriculture 5,500.00</p> 

<p>For Department of Horticulture 1,500.00</p> 

<p>For Music 2,500.00</p> 

<p>For dedication, state days, etc 2,000.00</p> 

<p>For commissioners' expenses, administration, incidental expenses</p> 

<p>connected therewith, and expenses not otherwise specified 4,800.00</p> 

<p>For secretary's office, with assistants and incidental expenses 2,800.00</p> 

<p>For assistants, employes in the Iowa State Building and in connection with the state exhibits 2,625.00</p> 

<p>For sinking fund, insurance, returning exhibits, wrecking building, 
etc 1.500.00</p> 

<p>This apportionment was subject to change by the joint action of the Executive Council and the Iowa Coniiuisaion or its Executive Committee.</p> 

<p>The Iowa Building was completed in accordance with the terms of the 
contract and furnished comfortably but without needless expense. 
The walls and ceilings were covered with burlap instead of being plastered, and on the walls was hung a very creditable display of the work of Iowa artists, under the direction of Commissioner Cook. The 
building was dedicated with proper ceremonies on the 23d of June, 1898. 
The exhibits in departments of Agriculture and Horticulture were conipleted and ready for inspection on June 1, the opening day of the Exposition; an account of the ceremonies as well as the celebration of Iowa 
day, September 21, will be fully given in the report of the Committee on 
Ceremonies.</p> 

<p>As soon as the building was completed and suitably furnished, the 
employes were installed and the house was opened to visitors from 8 a. m. until 8 p. m. every day during the Exposition, excepting Sundays. Of course, there were some complaints on account of the building not being open late in the evening and on Sundays, but the masses of the people from Iowa and other states were well satisfied and 
greatly pleased with the comfort, conveniences and attention they received 
at the building.</p> 

<p>Tables, supplied free of charge, with stationery and other writing material, were placed on the first and second floors. The postoffice was well 
patronized. The free check room was highly appreciated by all. It is true 
that sometimes our hospitality was abused, for in most of the state buildings a charge was made for checking, while it was well known that everything was free at the Iowa building. "What would we have done without 
the Iowa building?" was the expression of thousands of visitors.</p> 

<p>It was hardly possible with one set of employes to do more than was done. 
The entire building had to be cleaned and put in order every night and dusted 
every morning by the same parties that were in charge during the day. and 
repairs and extra cleaning had to be done on Sundays by the same employes.</p> 

<p>It was deemed inexpedient by the Executive Committee to go to the expense of having the building wired and furnished with electrical apphances 
for lighting, as there was practically no demand for keeping the building 
open after 8 p. m., as no effort was made to maintain any social functions 
at the building on account of the necessary expense it w^ould incur. The 
night watchman on duty was always ready to deliver packages and answer 
calls until after 12 o'clock.</p> 

<p>The popular concerts, fireworks and other attractions, furnished by the 
Exposition management, entertained all visitors every evening from 8 
o'clock until midnight, and the state buildings were practically deserted.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.036.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.036.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.036.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>Iowa's big book for registering the names of visitors was one of the chief 
attractions to the visitors from all the states. It was furnished to the 
Compiission free of charge by the Republican Printing Company of Cedar 
Rapids, and this, perhaps the largest book in the world, was nearly filled 
with names before the close of the Exposition.</p> 

<p>The book is ten inches thick and thirty inches wide and thirty-two inches 
long, contains nearly three thousand pages, and has space for over one hundred thousand names, and weighs, with the covers, three hundred pounds. 
Three books of gold leaf were used in the lettering and ornamentation. The 
material is valued at $200.00, and the total cost of the book $300.00.</p> 

<p>This book served its purpose well, and perhaps attracted more attention 
than any other Iowa exhibit, and I believe the Republican Printing Company of Cedar Rapids is entitled to the thanks of the Commission, and I beg 
to suggest that the book be deposited in the historical department, to be 
kept as a remembrance of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, in compliance 
with the request of the donor.</p> 

<p>VISITORS.</p> 

<p>Before the opening of the Exposition, when members of the Board of 
Management were inclined to criticise the Iowa board for the seeming lack 
of interest on account of our unwillingness to pay for space in the department exposition buildings, and for space on the grounds for the Iowa State 
building, they were repeatedly assured by your superintendent that Iowa 
would do her full share towards supporting the enterprise, and that she would 
send more visitors through the Exposition gates than any other state. These 
statements were fully verified, and it was stated by many that Iowa sent 
more visitors to the Exposition than all other states combined outside of Nebraska, and I believe the facts will prove these statements to be true. From 
the opening day of the Exposition until its close the attendance from Iowa 
was remarkable, especially from the western portion of the state. Nearly 
every week the railroads gave a rate of one cent a mile from all points 
within a radius of one hundred and fifty miles of Omaha, thus reaching 
Sioux City, Boone, Des Moines, and south to St. Joseph, Mo., and when 
the low rates were extended throughout the entire state, the rush of visitors from Iowa was marvelous, and before the close of the Exposition the 
members of the Board of Management were profuse with their compliments, both on account of what the state had done in the way of exhibits 
and for the large patronage by her citizens. This large number of visitors 
made the building a busy place.</p> 

<p>EMPLOYES.</p> 

<p>The total number of employes at the Iowa State building during the term 
ot the Exposition was twenty. Some of these were emploj^ed for one month 
only, others were re-appointed and remained two months, while only two 
outside of the secretary's office remained during the full term of the Exposition, thus carrying out the plan adopted by the Commission to change the 
employes whenever it could be done without detriment to the service.</p> 

<p>INSURANCE.</p> 

<p>In view of the combustible nature of the Iowa building and the buildings 
adjacent thereto, it was deemed advisable to place on the building a reasonable amount of insurance, not only on the building, but on its contents. 
In compliance with the instructions of the Executive Committee, I placed 
$5,500.00 of fire insurance and $3,500.00 tornado insurance upon the building, 
and $3,500.00 upon the furnishings and exhibits. The insurance on the building expired November 1, on the contents November 20, 1898.</p> 

<p>WATER SUPPLY.</p> 

<p>One of the greatest luxuries of the Iowa Building during the hot weather 
was the inexhaustiblesupplyof ice water at the drinking fountain in the hall 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.037.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.037.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.037.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of the building. This increased to some extent the amount of our ice and 
water bills, but we believe it was a good investment, and it seemed to be a 
necessity.</p> 

<p>REPAIRS.</p> 

<p>The repairs on the building from the time it came into the possession of 
the Commission until it was sold were nominal, with the exception of necessary repairs upon the roof to prevent leakage, but this had been provided 
for with the contractor, he having agreed in his contract to keep the roof 
in good repair until the close of the Exposition, which he did promptly whenever notified.</p> 

<p>During the last half of September and the month of October the 
weather was unreasonably cold. Oil stoves and large lamps were used, and 
everything that could be done for the comfort of visitors was done, but it 
was exceedingly uncomfortable both for visitors and employes.</p> 

<p>SALE OF BUILBING AND FURNITURE.</p> 

<p>Resolutions were adopted by the Executive Committee authorizing the 
superintendent to advertise for bids for wrecking the State building.</p> 

<p>The following resolution was adopted, instructing the seci-etary to dispose of the property of the Commission:</p> 

<p>Motion by Commissioner Moore "that Secretary Chase have full authority to sell all property of the Iowa Commission not already sold or otherwise disposed of."</p> 

<p>Also motion by Commissioner Markley "that the superintendent and 
secretary be authorized to continue employes until in his judgment their services were no longer necessary, and as soon as any employes can be disposed of the same should be done."</p> 

<p>The sale of the building was effected on October 29. Some of the furniture had already been listed for sale, and immediately after the close of 
the Exposition, all the employes not absolutely necessary to be retained to 
assist in dismantling and shipping the exhibits were dismissed, and the 
work of disposing of the furniture and other material was commenced, and 
the exhibits were boxed and shipped as rapidly as possible. The night 
watchman was retained, and during the night time patrolled the building 
constantly until all the property of the Commission was removed from the 
building. The material in the agricultural exhibit was disposed of.</p> 

<p>Statement of Salvage account is attached hereto marked "Exhibit A."</p> 

<p>The structures used in making up the installation in the horticultural 
building were of very little value on a?count of peculiar shape in which our 
exhibit in that building had to be installed, being one quarter of the center 
of the building under the dome The material used had to be cut in such 
manner as to make it worthless for any other purpose, and after several 
unsuccessful efforts had been made to dispose of it, at some price, it was 
left in the building.</p> 

<p>On November 20 your suparintendent removed the office to Cedar Falls, 
taking Mr. Thode, the bookkeeper, with him to assist in completing the 
work. We have made careful examination of the books, vouchers and accounts, compared with warrants, and prepared a financial statement carefully verified for the auditing committee. Since that time, all matters in 
connection with the salvage account and the disposition of matters pertaining to the live stock department have b3en settled.</p> 

<p>MEDALS AND DIPLOMAS.</p> 

<p>The Iowa exhibitors were remarkably fortunate in securing medals and 
diplomas in the departments of agriculture, dairy, apiary and horticulture. 
In the live stock department cash prizes were awarded in addition to ribbons and diplomas.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.038.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.038.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.038.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The premiums awarded were of the first, second and third class and 
honorable mention. All parties receiving an award were entitled to a diploma, and the diploma stated whether it was to be accompanied by a gold, 
silver or brass medal. Diplomas for honorable mention were not accompanied with medal.</p> 

<p>The Exposition management issued all their medals in bronze, and have 
been severely criticised for so doing. The Iowa Commission felt humiliated 
at having to distribute bronze medals where the diploma accompany the 
same called for gold or silver, but as no provision had been made for this 
unexpected event, they did not feel justified in expending the money belonging to the state for gold or silver plating and engi'aving the medals. They 
were, therefore, distributed from this ofllce as they came from the bureau of 
awards, each one, however, accompanied by a letter of explanation.</p> 

<p>The collective exhibits made by the Commission in the horticultural 
building and the agricultural building were both entered in competition with 
other states and territories, and we were awarded diploma and gold medal 
on each. I have had these inedals gold plated and properly engraved, and 
they are now ready to turn over to the state.</p> 

<p>The total number of awards to Iowa exhibitors in all departments was 
602.</p> 

<p>RE-OPENING OF THE EXPOSITION.</p> 

<p>A short time before the close of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, a project was started for reopening the Exposition in 1899. Mass meetings were held, and some of the representatives of the several states who had participated in the Trans-Mississippi Exposition were very enthusiastic and anxious to participate in the new Exposition. Being the only representative of the Iowa Commission present at the time, and being urged to attend 
these meetings, I took the responsibility of declining and saying that 
Iowa would not participate in an Exposition if held in 1899. I was obliged 
to take action without consultation, and from my past experience in these 
matters, I felt sure that both the Commission and the Executive Council 
of State would approve the action I had taken.</p> 

<p>DISBURSEMENTS.</p> 

<p>After the apportionment of the funds at the disposal of the Commission 
by the special committee appointed by the Executive Council and the Commission, it required careful forethought on the part of the superintendent in order that the expenditures in the several departments should not exceed 
the amount set apart for each. The superintendent, under the rules, was 
disbursing agent. I am able to report that in nearly every instance the expense incurred in each department was less than the amount named by the committee. The exceptions were in the department of furniture and furnishings for the State building, and in the horticultural exhibit. In the department of furnishings for the State building, the necessary expense exceeded the amount appropriated for that purpose. This was on account of 
unexpected work that had to be done by the Commission to beautify the 
grounds, gravel the walks and for flags and decorations, and this department seemed to be the appropriate one to which such should be made. The water supply, ice bills and many other incidentals, w^ere also put into this 
account.</p> 

<p>The amount set aside for installing and maintaining an exhibit of the 
horticulture of the State was $1,.500. It was thought at the time that this 
would be insufficient, but it was hoped and expected that from $500.00 to 
SI, 000. 00 would be added to this amount by contribution from the State 
Horticultural Society. Nothing, however, was received from that Society.</p> 

<p>Some small errors were found in verifying the accounts, and the amount 
of these, with more than one thousand dollars received on account of salvage, has been turned over to Treasurer McCoid.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.039.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.039.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.039.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>It is a source of gratification that I am able to report that the expense 
of administration has been less than was anticipated, and from the amount 
set apart for this purpose and for the Agricultural Exhibit, enough was 
saved to aid the Iowa Live Stock exhibitors to the extent of $1,5000.00. This 
aid brought out a very creditable exhibit from the stock breeders of Iowa. 
All these matters are fully shown in the financial statement. That statement 
also shows that one thousand dollars of the amount appropriated was never 
drawn from the State treasury, and the sum of three thousand dollars has 
been refunded to the State. A small balance is still in the treasury of the 
Commission, which will be sufficient for the publication and distribution of 
the final report of the Commission and the incidental expenses connected 
therewith. All of which will be accounted for in a supplemental report, with 
proper vouchers for expenditures, and will be placed on file with the governor.</p> 

<p>All of which is most respectfully submitted,</p> 

<p>F. N. CHASE.</p> 

<p>Superintendent and Secretary Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International 
Exposition Commission.</p>

<p>Report ot the Department of fine Arts.</p> 

<p>By S. D. COOK.</p> 

<p>When the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission was organized it was intended that the Department of Liberal Arts 
and fine Arts should be creditably represented at the Exposition, and I had 
the honor of being chosen by the Iowa Commission as Commissioner of Education and Fine Arts, and at once placed myself in touch with the educators and artists of the State, which is conspicuous in the middle west for its 
institutions of learning. My efforts met with hearty response.</p> 

<p>But as a member of the Executive Committee I soon discovered that we 
could not properly represent all the departments the Commission had originally outlined. Realizing that the state's basis of wealth and prosperity were agriculture, live stock and horticulture and that the funds at our 
command would not justify us in making exhibits outside of these industries I proposed to abandon the educational and fine arts exhibit, which 
was concurred in by the Commission.</p> 

<p>I then proposed to solicit the artists of the state for a loan of their 
best work for the purpose of interior decoration of the Iowa building. This 
request was generously responded to, and the cost of transportation and installation was saved from other appropriations. In addition to this, with 
the consent of the Commission I ordered ten large tapestries representing 
the leading industries of Iowa, which were executed by the noted artist, Carl 
Burrette, at the nominal expense of two hundred and fifty dollars ($2.50.00). 
These pictures were a unique feature of the Iowa building, and attracted considerable notice. They could have been sold on the Exposition grounds for 
much more than their original cost, but, with the consent of the Executive 
Council, I respectfully recommend that they be turned over to the historical department and become a permanent possession of the State.</p> 

<p>Respectfully submitted,</p> 

<p>S. D. COOK, Commissioner in Charge.</p>

<p>Report of the Department ot Live Stock</p> 

<p>S. B. PACKARD.</p> 
<p>Commissioner in Charge.</p> 

<p>To the President and Members of the Iowa Commission, Trans-Mississippi 
and International Exposition.</p> 

<p>Gentlemen: As Commissioner in charge of the Iowa Exhibit of Live 
Stock, I beg to submit the following report:</p> 

<p>The Live Stock Exhibit opened September 19 and closed October 20. Division P, the Exhibit of Poultry, opened September 19 and closed September 30; division A, Exhibit of Cattle; B, Horses, Jacks, Jennets and Mules; C, 
Sheep; D, Swine, opened October 3, closed October 20. Division E, Fat Stock, 
opened October 13, closed October 20. Entries were advertised to close 
August 10, except Fat Stock, Avhich closed August 15. The time of closing 
of entries was extended in some cases to a later date.</p> 

<p>The determination of the Exposition Management to pay no cash prizes 
was so generally disapproved and caused such wide dissatisfaction among 
the intending exhibitors that for a time it seemed that the Exhibition would 
prove a failure. The premium lists were not issued pending this period of 
uncertainty. Finally, the Exposition Management authorized cash premiums 
to the amount of about thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00), and soon 
thereafter issued premium lists, when the condition changed and the work 
of preparation was actually begun by the owners of live stock.</p> 

<p>A catalogue of the entries was prepared and issued, sold at twenty-flve 
cents per copy, upon the opening of the exhibit, showing two thousand 
three hundred and fifty (2,350) animals, occupying fifty barns, which were 
found generally satisfactory for the sheltering of the stock, an ampitheater 
was built surrounding a spacious ring for judging the cattle and horses 
and providing comfortable seats for visitors to witness the placing of the 
ribbons. The barns were built facing two main streets running east and 
west. The horse barns were 36x100 feet; the cattle barns 34x100 feet; the 
sheep and swine barns 30x100 feet, with seven feet posts at the walls, with 
broad passageways through the center for the use of visitors. There was 
a charge of five dollars per stall (double) for cattle; three dollars per stall 
(single) for hoi-ses; and two dollars and forty cents per pen for swine and 
sheep—horse stalls six feet in width, cattle stalls ten feet, and pens seven 
by eight feet. Exhibitors and caretakers had to pay for a season pass for 
each person two dollars. Forage, grain and bedding was furnished at market prices. A switching or terminal charge of five dollars per car for bringing the car in and the same amount for taking the car out was charged by 
the Exposition. It may be presumed that a trifle of this amount went to 
the railways, which had tracks to the Exposition Grounds. It will thus be 
seen that an exhibitor was well taxed for the opportunity to show his 
stock and to try to win some of the premiums offered.</p> 

<p>Stock was exhibited from states as far east as New York, west to Colorado, north to Canada and south to Kentucky, but Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas.: Illinois and Wisconsin were the principal states that made 
the exhibit.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.046.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.046.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.046.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>The Exhibit of Poultry was small, and few people found the place wherethe birds were shown. Nebraska provided an exhibit on the main thoroughfare (not for premiums) which was generally regarded by the public as the 
Exposition Exhibit, but this exhibit was in a distant part of the grounds in 
one of the stock barns.</p> 

<p>This report will be confined to the record of Iowa in the exhibits, but 
the number of competing herds, flocks, etc., from other states will be noted 
in connection with the awards. There were exhibits of some breeds of

<p>The Exhibit of Cattle at the Exposition was a record breaker. The Herefords, leading with an exhibit the equal of which was never seen in this 
country, and probably never in England, with an entry list of nineteen 
herds, the display in all classes was one long to be remembered by those 
present. Two of the herds were from Iowa, as noted.</p>

<p>IOWA RECORD.</p> 

<p>The best of the cattle of beef breeds exhibited from Iowa were in the 
Short Horn and Aberdeen Angus classes Six herds of Short Horns were 
from Iowa, one each from Nebraska, Minnesota and Missouri, while the show 
of "doddies" included four Iowa herds and one each from Illinois and Nebraska.</p> 

<p>THE OFFICIALS.</p> 

<p>The Superintendent of the Live Slock Exhibit was J. B. Dinsmore of 
Sutton, Neb., and assistant, C. H. Elmendorf, Nebraska men with experience. Mr. Dinsmore having occupied the same post at the Chicago World's 
Fair.</p> 

<p>JUDGING.</p> 

<p>Mr. Dinsmore selected Mr. Richard Gibson of Canada as judge in the 
Short Horn classes. This selection met with a determined protest from Mr. 
G. E. Ward, Hawarden, Iowa. Mr. Ward, at great expense, secured and fitted a herd of Short Horns, which warranted his expectations of winning the blue ribbon throughout the circuit of 1898. His principal competitor was the 
Minnesota herd owned by H. F. Brown. The first battle was fought in the 
aged bull class at the Minnesota State Fair, where the two judges, one 
from Iowa and the other from Minnesota, "tied," each favoring the representative of his State, and a Minnesota umpire awarded first to Mr. Brown's bull nominee, and second to St. Valentine," Mr. Ward's bull. This decision, while not satisfactory, was abided by with the best grace possible, with the expectation that at the Indiana and Illinois State fairs other influence would give fair play. Mr. Ward made the circuit with his herd. While at Indianapolis and Springfield his St. Valentine won, but did not encounter the Minnesota herd till reaching Omaha. There Mr. Ward felt that since Mr. Gibson was reported to be the brother-in-law of the man who had raised Mr. Brown's bull, "Nominee," and was said to have figured in 
his purchase for use in the Brown herd, and would not be sufficiently impartial to be placed as judge </p>

<p>PROTEST.</p> 

<p>In protesting to Mr. Dinsmore against having Mr. Gibson act as judge, 
these reports were given as a resaon why a change should be made. This 
brought out the suggestion from the superintendent that if the judge was 
unsatisfactory he (Ward) need not bring his herd to the Exposition. On reflection, and on the advice of prominent owners of Short Horn cattle who were much interested in having a good exhibit of the breed and that the 
absence of the herd would leave the way open without embarrassment for 
the honors to go to the Minnesota herd, Mr. Ward's herd was taken to 
Omaha, notwithstanding the apparent lack of fair play promised. The selection of Mr. Gibson as one of the judges to award the sweepstakes was also met with a firm protest by the Short Horn and Hereford Exhibitors, 
and upon the refusal to substitute some other person, the Hereford and 
Short Horn breeders, with the single exception of the Minnesota herd of 
Short Horns and the "cross" herd of Hereford, were not led into the ring.</p> 

<p>AWARDS IN CLASSES.</p> 

<p>The award of first place to "Nominee," the Minnesota bull, over St. Valentine the Iowa bull, by the judge was received by the onlookers with hisses. In the herd contest of this breed the award of first to the Minnesota 
herd over the Ward Iowa herd by the same judge was received with even a 
more marked disapproval by the grand stand and the exhibitors about the 
ring. While Iowa had, except in the Hereford classes, the best exhibit of 
cattle of any State, she certainly, without representation in the management 
was entitled to fair play in the judging: ribbons won otherwise only emphasizes the lack of superiority and wilely advertises that fact at the same 
time.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.050.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.050.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.050.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>In some cases animals are so nearly equal in merit that a fancy or bias 
of a type or quality can honestly be shown by a judge without prejudice, 
and in such a contest it is always considered no discredit to an owner when 
good judges concede that of two animals either can be put first according 
to one's fancy without discrediting the second.</p> 

<p>It is not, however, considered good form for an owner to give more attention to the selection of the judge than is consistent in getting fair play.</p>

<p>JERSEY CATTLE.</p>

<p>The Jersey ring was the best show of Jerseys that has been seen since 
the Worlds Fair at Chicago.</p> 

<p>There were two herds from Nebraska and one each from New York, Indiana, Missouri and Iowa, represented by L. E. Williams, of Glenwood. None 
of the Iowa herd caught the eye of the judge for a cash prize. The same was 
true of the two Iowa herds of Hereford cattle, but this fact does not prove 
the lack of merit of the Jersey or Hereford Iowa herds, but only emphasizes 
the superior quality of these two breeds exhibited, the equal of which may 
not be seen in the near future.</p>

<p>Mr. Z. T. Kinsell, of Mt. Ayr, with his young herd of Herefords, stood 
sixth, but could have been placed higher with no injustice to those taking 
ribbons in this ring of eight herds.</p> 

<p>Division E, Fat Stock, attracted very little interest, though there was a 
small but very high class showing of steers in fat stock and car lot classes.</p> 

<p>The State Agricultural College exhibited some pure bred Short Horn 
steers and grades in car lot classes, as follows:</p>

<p>HORSES.</p> 

<p>The exhibit of horses was not conspicuously large in numbers nor complete in number of breeds, though high class, yet it lacked in competition.</p> 

<p>Iowa had two first-class stables beside a good specimen sent from the Iowa Agricultural College, which took third premium in a good ring of 2-year-old Percherons, as follows:</p>

<p>This Exhibit was generally conceded to have been the best ever seen in 
the Western country, showing that the owners of the stout boned red hogs 
are meeting with great success for their favorite breed.</p> 

<p>Six herds were shown from Nebraska, two from Iowa and one from Illinois, and one from Ohio, but the honors were largely taken by the veteran breeder from Iowa, to whom great credit is due. His score is as follows:</p>

<p>REPORT OF THE Department of Agriculture, Dairy and Apiary.</p> 

<p>At the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, Omaha, June to November, 1898.</p> 

<p>Report of the Department of Agriculture.</p> 

<p>To the President and Members of the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission: </p>

<p>In submitting this report I desire to state that at the second session of 
the Iowa Commission, held in Council Bluffs, July 1, 1897, the following resolution was presented by Commissioner Packard:</p> 

<p>"Resolved, That for the purpose of securing the necessary grains, grasses, 
straw and other material from the growing crops when in proper condition 
for exhibition and for decorative purposes, also such fruits and other products of the soil as may be obtained from the crop of 1897,to be used as part 
of the Iowa State Exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha in 1898, the secretary is hereby instructed to collect, prepare and preserve, at the expense of the Commission, the foregoing 
products at an expense not to exceed the sum of eight hundred dollars ($800), 
and this sum, or such part thereof as may be necessary, is hereby set apart 
for that purpose, and the president and secretary are hereby authorized 
to draw warrants upun the Treasurer of tlie Commission -for the same, upon 
proper vouchers." Resolution adopted.</p> 

<p>During the same session of the Commission, plans were discussed for 
making exhibits of the industries of Iowa in the various departments at 
the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. It was hoped at that 
time that sufficient appropriation would be made by the Twenty-seventh 
General Assembly to enable the Commission to make a creditable exhibit of 
all the varied industries of our State, and departments were assigned to the 
different members of the Commission, and, on motion of Commission Cook, 
I was appointed as Commissioner to take charge of the Agricultural, Dairy 
and Apiary Departments.</p> 

<p>In order to secure the best results, I found it necessary to commence 
promptly the work of securing specimens from the growing crops, and immediately after the adjournment of the Commission, acting under the resolution above written, I secured the services of some well known experts in 
different parts of the state, giving them minute instructions as to the material desired for making a creditable exhibit, and for decorative purposes. 
I secured cold storage for fruit and a suitable warehouse at Council 
Bluffs for* storing the material for the Agricultural Exhibit, and all grains, 
grasses and other material, whenever it was sufficiently cured, was properly 
boxed and sent to this warehouse for storage until it was needed the following spring.</p> 

<p>So far as the exhibit of agricultural and farm products was concerned, 
I deemed it best to make that exhibit as permanent as possible before the 
opening of the Exposition, not only In the interest of economy, but with two 
special objects in view:</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.072.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.072.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.072.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.073.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.073.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.073.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>First—To install an artistic exhibit and make a pleasing decorative display of natural products, making corn in all the many varieties and colors 
a leading feature, introducing grains, grasses, seeds, plants and herbs in the 
most attractive forms.</p>

<p>Second—to show in the exhibit the best specimens not only of the products of our soil, but the soil itself, knowing that an exhibit of this kind 
properly installed required but little replenishing during the entire term of 
the Exposition. </p>

<p>At a subsequent session of the Commission and after an additional appropriation had been made by the General Assembly, it was decided by the 
Commission to make no exhibit in any of the departments of the Exposition unless space should be granted free in the various exhibition buildings 
for the purpose of installing the Iowa exhibits. Only a limited amount of 
free space was granted, and it was decided to allot that space in the Agricultural and Horticultural Buildings and make the best possible exhibits 
thereon. The sum of Ave thousand five hundred dollars ($5,500.00) was set 
apart to install and maintain an exhibit in the Agricultural Department, and 
L. G. Clute, of Greeley, Delaware County, Iowa, was nominated superintendent, and his nomination confirmed by the Commission.</p> 

<p>Twelve hundred (1,200) square feet of space was secured in the center of 
the Agricultural building; the location was one of the most desirable and 
prominent in the building; drawing for platform and superstructures were 
made by Josselyn &amp; Taylor Co., architects, contract for construction was 
let to P. H. Wind of Council Bluffs, and the Commission secured the services 
of the well known decorator, D. E. Milward, to do the decorative work and 
assist in the installation of the exhibit. In addition to the decorative work, 
twenty-five hundred (2,500) inverted glass show bottles and tubes were filled 
Avith grain and seeds and helped to complete the installation of the most attractive exhibit in the entire building.</p> 

<p>As proof of the excellence of the work, the quality of the material and 
the artistic design, the state of Iowa was awarded a diploma and gold 
medal for its collective state exhibit.</p> 

<p>The flax industry of northern and western Iowa was represented by some very fine samples of flax, flax seed and flax spinning fiber. These specimens were, at my request, secured by Hon. Jasper Thompson of Forest City. </p>

<p>A prominent feature of the Iowa Agricultural Exhibit was the samples of 
Iowa soil which was shown in glass cylinders six inches in diameter and six 
eet in length. These samples were especially attractive and received favorable comment.</p> 

<p>During the Exposition arrangement.-, were made with the officers of the 
Iowa State Agricultural College and Experiment Station to make a special 
exhibit of farm products, and a location was assigned them on the space allotted to Iowa in the Agricultural Building, and a most creditable exhibit 
was installed by Mr. James Atkinson, asistant in agriculture, under the direction of President Beardshear of the College and Director C. P. Curtis 
of the Experiment Station. After the installation of this exhibit was completed, it became a part of our State Exhibit and was cared for by our superintendent in charge.</p> 

<p>During the months of August and September some very fine specimens 
of corn were placed on exhibition by Iowa farmers interested in the success 
of our State Exhibit. Some of these spscimens, I feel sure, were the finest 
ever produced, and I wish to extend my thanks to the parties contributing 
these specimens, and also the thanks of the Commission. I think every one 
of these specimens entered in the competitive contest was awarded a diploma or medal.</p> 

<p>In this connection I desire to mention the eflkient and faithful services 
performed by L. G. Clute. superintendent, during the entire term 
of the Exposition he was in charge, and with the exception of a few days 
during his illness he performed all the duties, and the Commission was at no 
expense for other assistants in that dejiartment.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable feature in the State Agricultural Exhibit was 
the magnificent showing made of Iowa's principal product. I refer to the display and quality of Indian Corn, of which we exhibited over one hundred 
varieties, and we can state, without fear of successful contradiction, that the 
corn exhibit not only equaled, but was superior to that of any other state.</p>

<p>DAIRY DEPARTMENT.</p> 

<p>It was the desire of youi" Commissioner in cliarge of the Dairy Department of the Iowa Exliibit, and of all the members of the Commission, to 
have Iowa malce a creditable exhibit in this Department. The dairy industry has grown to be one of the most important and profitable industries of 
our great commonwealth. The product of our creameries sells on its merit 
everywhere, and the attention of the world has been drawn to our state on 
account of the exhibits that have been made at previous great expositions, 
and on account of the large number of premiums awarded to Iowa for the 
very high score that had been made at those expositions by the butter exhibited from the creameries and dairies of our state. The magnificent record made at the Worlds Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, winning, 
as we did, one hundred and twenty awards on butter sent from creameries 
and dairies has added thousands if not millions of dollars to the wealth of 
our state. </p>

<p>Our first visit to Omaha, in company with Chairman Packard of our Executive Committee, and acting as sub-cnmmittee for securing free space for 
Iowa Exhibits, we had several interviews with the Commissioner in charge 
of the dairy department of the Exposition, also with the Board of Management, in order that we might, if possible, secure free space in the dairy 
building for an exhibit of butter from the Iowa creameries. We were unable 
to secure any space except upon payment in compliance with their rules. At 
the next session of the Executive Committe I brought the matter to their 
attention, and it was fully discussed, but as the rules for making exhibits in 
that department had not yet been pu'jlished, no definite action was taken. 
At a late date, however, the rules were published, requiring every exhibitor to make five exhibits, one during each month of the Exposition.</p> 

<p>After sending copies of the rules to the leading creamery men of the state 
and to the dairy commissioner and president of the State Dairy Association, 
I visited the commissioner, and it was his opinion, and his views were endorsed by many of the buttermakers of the State, that it would be unwise 
to try to exhibit under the rules, and be obliged to submit to five tests, as it 
must necessarily lower the record of the best buttermakers if they were 
obliged to make butter and ship it to the Exposition during the months of 
July and August. I at once corresponded with superintendents in charge of 
the Dairy Department of some other states that were interested, and all 
joined in asking the Board of Management to change their rules and have 
three tests instead of five, thereby materially reducing the expense to states 
and individuals and also giving opportunity to obtain a better record. These 
efforts, however, failed, and it was deemed best to give up that part of our 
State Exhibit, as we feared conditions would be such that Iowa would gain 
nothing under existing circumstances.</p> 

<p>Another difficulty was in the fact that refrigeration in the dairy building was not perfect until the last of July or early in August. Later some 
changes were made in the rules by the manager of the dairy department, allowing each exhibit to be tested and award made for that exhibit without 
reference to the tests that might be made in any other month. We immediately corresponded with our creamery men, and many individual exhibits 
were made, and in almost every instance the score was equal to the best, 
and in one or two instances we scored higher on creamery butter than any 
other State. John M. Turnbull of Atlantic, having scored the highest number of points in any one test, was awarded a gold medal.</p> 

<p>After the close of the Exposition, I received notice from the Department 
of Exhibits that a bronze medal had been awarded to Iowa for her State Exhibit in the dairy department. I immediately replied that the State of Iowa 
through its Commission, had made no State Exhibit, and had not entered 
into competition with other States in that department during the Exposition, and made a vigorous protest against having the matter published in 
their official report in that way, and stated that all the exhibits that had

at the Exposition in October. State Dairy Commissioner Gates died very 
suddenly while delivering an address before the assembled dairymen of the 
west.</p> 

<p>APIARY DEPARTMENT.</p> 

<p>A large and commodious building was erected on the northwest part of 
the Exposition Grounds for the installation of exhibits in the Apiary Department. Here was ample room for the largest exhibits that could possibly 
have been made by the States interested in an Exhibit of Comb and Extracted Honey, Bees and Apiary Implements, Appliances and Machinery.</p> 

<p>We secured space and glass cases and installed a very fine exhibit of 
both comb and extracted honey, and showed not only the crop of 189S, but 
also several hundred pounds of very fine comb honey, perfectly preserved, 
from the crop of 1897. This was secured during the summer of 1897, when 
we were engaged in gathering material for exhibit in the Agricultural and 
Horticultural Departments. The exhibit from the crop of 1898 was largely 
made up from the Apiary of L. G. Clute. of Delaware County, and was 
furnished at his own expense with the exception of transportation and 
local charges.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.082.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.082.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.082.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>Mr. E. Kretchmer of Red Oak also made a very large exhibit of Apiary 
implements and appliances. This exhibit, he maintained during the entire 
Exposition.</p> 

<p>I am glad to be able to furnish the very high score made by the Iowa 
honey on exhibition as reported by Hon. Eugene Secor, Judge.</p> 

<p>The following entries were made by L. G. Clute. To illustrate, I give 
one score in full (a score of one hundred points was perfect). Comb 
Honey; variety, White Clover; Score, as follows: </p>

<p>Points.

<p>Report of the Department of Horticulture.</p> 

<p>S. H. MALLORY.</p> 

<p>Commissioner in Charge.</p>

<p>To the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission:—</p>

<p>Having been placed in charge of the Horticultural Department of the 
Iowa Exihibit, I beg to present the following report:</p> 

 
<p>At the second session of the Iowa Commission held at Council Bluffs, 
June 29-30, July 1st, 1897, for the better performance of its duties, and 
anticipating an additional appropriation sufficient to make a creditable exhibit of all the varied industries of Iowa, the work was divided into departments and a member of the Commission was assigned to take charge 
of each. At this session I was, by vote of the Commission, placed in 
charge of this department.</p>

<p>At a subsequent session, when it was known that the limited amount appropriated would not admit of expenditures for an exhibit in all departments it was decided to make exhibit only where free space was granted, 
namely: in the Agricultural and Horticultural Exposition Buildings, and 
revised schedule of estimates was prepared by a sub-committee of the 
Executive Committee, setting apart the sum of $1,500.00 for an exhibit of 
Iowa Horticulture, it being understood and expected that this amount 
would be supplemented by financial aid and co-operation from the State 
Horticultural Society.</p> 

<p>Hon. A. F. Collman, of Corning, was named as Superintendent, believing that his appointment would be satisfactory to the State Horticultural 
Society as well as to the Iowa Commission. His appointment was confirmed by the Commission.</p> 

<p>SPACE.</p> 

<p>Twelve hundred (1,200) square feet of space was secured in the center of 
the Horticultural Building. This was considered one of the best locations in the building.</p> 

<p>INSTALLATION.</p> 

<p>Plans for suitable structures for this space and for an artistic installation were submitted by D. E. Mil ward and were approved by Superintendent Taylor, in charge of the Horticultural Building. Contract was entered into with Mr. Mil ward for erecting the superstructures and decorating the space, with a view of making the installation as artistic as possible and to harmonize with the floral and pomological exhibits to be 
shown thereon.</p> 

<p>EXHIBIT.</p> 

<p>Contract was also made with J. F. Wilcox. Florist, of Council Bluffs, 
Iowa to install on one of the pagodas a floral exhibit and maintain the 
same during the Exposition. This he did with credit to himself and the 
State.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.088.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.088.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.088.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>Superintendent Collman secured from the crop of 1897 a large quantity 
and quite a number of varieties of apples, which were placed in cold storage until the opening of the Exposition, when they were placed on exhibition, and in addition thereto a large assortment of small fruits in their season were received almost daily, filling over one thousand plates, and keeping up a fairly creditable exhibit during the summer months. Possibly, 
the showing was not what it might have been, but the season of 1898 was 
very disastrous to fruit, especially the apple crop, and the total failure of 
this crop in some sections of the State and partial failure in other parts 
necessarily crippled the exhibit to some extent.</p> 

<p>In September, Superintendent Collman resigned and the Commission appointed Mr. J. W. Murphy of Glenwood as his successor. He remained in 
charge until the close of the Exposition. Mr. Murphy being from Mills 
County, which is doubtless the banner apple County in the State, his 
friends took special interest and contributed largely to the exhibit during September and October, thus enabling the Commission to make a very 
creditable showing of the fall and winter varieties of apples. Many very 
fine specimens were shown from nearly every section of the States during 
the months above named.</p> 

<p>The display of grapes was undoubtedly the best ever shown by Iowa.</p> 

<p>In addition to the exhibit made by the Iowa Commission in this department in competition with other states, the citizens of Council Bluffs and 
Pottawattamie County made an exhibit of grapes and small fruits in the 
Wigwam that was erected by the Exposition Association of Council Bluffs 
which attracted the attention of many thousands of visitors.</p> 

<p>No funds were received from the State Horticultural Society or other 
organizations, and the sum of fifteen hundred dollars previously set apart 
by the Commission was not sufficient to maintain the exhibit during the entire term of the Exposition, the total expenses for this department being 
about $2,300.00 as shown by the financial statement and report of the 
Auditing Committee. The deficit was supplied from the funds set apart 
for the Agricultural Department.</p> 

<p>AWARDS.</p> 

<p>That the Jury of Awards found much in the Iowa display of real merit 
is shown by the following list of Medals and Diplomas awarded to the 
State of Iowa and to Iowa exhibitors:</p>

<p>Report of Comittee on Ceremonies </p>

<p>By J. E. E. MARKLEY, Chairman.</p> 

<p>To the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission:</p> 

<p>Your Committee have the honor to report as follows:</p> 

<p>The Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission in 
session at Des Moines, April 5, 1S98, adopted the following:</p> 

<p>"On motion, Commissioners Packard and Markley were appointed to act 
in conjunction with the Secretary in pieparing a program for the dedication of the Iowa Building."</p> 

<p>The following motion was also adopted:</p> 

<p>"That Commissioner Packard be appointed a committee of one to correspond with Hon. R. G. Cousins with reference to delivering the oration at 
the Exposition on Iowa State Day."</p> 

<p>At the fifth session of the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Enposition Commission, held in Council Eluffs, May 30, the following motion was adopted:</p>

<p>"That Commissioners Markley and Packard and Secretary Chase be appointed a Committee to select a band for Iowa Dedication Day, and that 
they be continued as a Permanent Committee on Ceremonies, with full 
power to act."</p>

<p>The more important duties to be performed by your Committee were to 
make arrangements for appropriate ceremonies for the Dedication of the 
Iowa State Building, and to plan and carry out a program for the celebration of Iowa State Day.</p> 

<p>The date for the Dedicatory Ceremonies could not then be fixed, as it 
was not known when the Building would be completed.</p> 

<p>The date for the celebration of Iowa State Day had been arranged by a 
Sub-Committeee composed of Chairman Packard and Secretary Chase, who, 
in conference with President Wattles, of the Exposition Board, set aside 
September 20 and 21 as Iowa State Days. When the time came to make the 
arrangements, your Committee decided to have but one day's celebration, 
and fixed the date as September 21, and so reported to the Executive Committee. There were a number of requests to have the date changed, and efforts were made by your Committee to secure some other date, but without success.</p> 

<p>Your Committee had several meetings for conference, and selected June 
23 as the day for dedicating and formally opening the Iowa Building, and 
September 21 for Iowa Day. This action was approved by the Executive 
Committee. Chairman Markley secured music for Dedication Day, and it 
was arranged to meet Governor Shaw and the State officers, the President 
and other officers of the Exposition at the Murray Hotel. The procession 
was formed at 1:00 p. m. and proceeded to the Iowa State Building, where 
the following program was successfully carried out:</p>

<p>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT MALLORY.</p> 

<p>Read by Chairman Packard.</p> 

<p>DEDICATION lOAVA BUILDING JUNE 23, 1898.</p> 

<p>YOUR EXCELLENCY:</p>

<p>Looking through the vista of the ages past, one fails to see any such 
gathering of the people as we witness here at this grand Exposition 
today. Instead, we see the people meeting in vast concourse to rejoice with 
and crown the returning victorious general, whose armies have spread 
death and devastation amongst their enemies; the trophies exhibited to the 
admiring crowd are not such exhibits as we have before us today, but men 
of note, princes and generals, led as captives in the triumphal procession 
and forced to do homage to the victorious leader. The righteousness of the 
cause that had triumphed they did not proclaim; only the number and rank 
of the captives, the value of the plunder, the number of the enemy slain, 
and the devastation wrought; and these were amply sufficient to cause their 
rejoicing.</p> 

<p>As the years roll on, we see that the arts of peace become of more importance to the people, if not to their rulers, than the arts of war, and men 
strive to subjugate the forces of nature, rather than subjugate their fellow men, and so civilization advances.</p> 

<p>That man has not degenerated in his physical powers by the growth and 
enlargement of his moral faculties and perception, or become enervated by 
the luxuries obtained and enjoyed through victories of the brain, or lost 
his manhood and courage in his greed and struggle for the possession of 
wealth, that he might obtain these enjoyments, is made patent to all the 
world today by the glorious uprising of the people of this our land to relieve the distressed and succor the oppressed of downtrodden Cuba, struggling for freedom; not merely with words of encouragement, but with heroic deeds that speak far louder than words—and Dewey, Sampson, Powell,

and Hobson with his immortal crew of seven, are types of manhood under 
the civilization and liberty enjoyed by us who live under the folds of these 
glorious Stars and Stripes.</p> 

<p>The alchemist of old searching after the philosopher's stone secreted 
himself in the dark recesses of some gloomy cavern, far away from the 
eyes of man, that his researches might not be made known. The first national industrial exhibition of which we have any record, held in England 
by and under the auspices of the Society of Arts in the year 1761, offered 
valuable prizes as an inducement for the display of miscellaneous and agricultural machinery. So jealous then were the inventors and patentees of 
their invention and improvements that none would make an exhibit unless 
special guards were employed and placed around their exhibits, whose duty 
it should be to keep all foreigners at a distance and prevent any one from 
making drawings of their machinery, for in those days the leading nations 
of Europe—England, Germany, Holland and France—had their secret agents, 
scientists, scholars and artizans, employes of their respective governments

who traveled in disguise through foreign countries endeavoring to pry out 
the secrets held by the industrial classes of other nations and communicate 
them to their home government. Hard, indeed, oftimes was the task of 
these secret agents, with such jealous care were these secrets hidden. France 
for centuries defied their efforts to discover certain industrial secrets she 
held, and they were only finally made known to other nations through the 
emigration of the Hugenots, who carried the secrets with them.</p> 

<p>Unlike these, we today in the broad glare of the noonday sun display 
before the world at large the results of our improvements and the advancements made in Arts, Science, Mechanics, Manufacture and Agriculture, all 
that conduces to our welfare, comfort and prosperity that all men may be 
benefitted through the results obtained by us.</p> 

<p>Had we been permitted to view the display at the first national exposition in London in 1761 and compare it with the display here in Omaha today, 
we no doubt would have pronounced it exceedingly limited, meager and 
crude, and seeing the guards at their posts watching for foreigners and

strangers would have deemed it very exclusive, and yet it was the com-
mencement of a movement to foster taste for invention and mechanics, which 
improvement soon spread throughout continental Europe. In the year 1798, 
soon after the revolution by which Napoleon was made Emperor, a national 
exposition was held in Paris. The grand results arising from this first 
French Exposition were so marked in the advancement of mechanics and art 
that through the urgency of Napoleon, who was quick to see their importance and value, frequent displays of like character followed in all parts of the Empire, and Tallyrand declared that in their encouragement lay the hidden and future glory of the French people. The advanced position France took as a nation in Art, Manufactures and Commerce in the years following these expositions proved the truth of his prophecy. These freciuent expositions served as schools in which 
the people received their education and acquired that taste for the arts 
which has since made France so famous.</p> 

<p>The evolution of national expositions in the United States was first the 
town hall, the county fair, two or more counties uniting, the state fair, 
and the group of states uniting. With such favor have they been received 
that each year we have one or more national expositions. Iowa, the beautiful land, the garden of agriculture, with its fifty-five thousand square 
miles of rich, fertile, tillable land, traversed with clear running streams, a 
veritable paradise, was, less than one hundred years ago, untrodden by the 
foot of the white man, its ownership resting in Spain, its beauties unknown 
its boundaries not established until 1S20. Born into the family of states less 
than fifty-two years ago, or about thirteen years after the first cabin was 
built by a white man in its borders, Iowa now has its whole area dotted 
with Colleges. Academies, Schools and Churches; a population of over two 
million, and is bound together by 8,500 miles of steel, its railroads touching the capital of every county in its domain but one, and serving, with the 
wide rivers on its eastern and western borders, to carry its vast productions 
to the markets of the world.</p> 

<p>IOWA, with a soil producing all standard grains, grasses, vegetables, 
and fruits in abundance, is an agricultural state, standing first in the union 
of states with its crop of corn, and fourth in the production of all agricultural products, yet with her inexhaustible deposits of coal, her metallic ores 
of lead, zinc and iron, she offei's large opportunities and possibilities for 
prominence as a manufacturing State—thus Iowa comes in company with 
her sister states, not with a spirit of envy, but of friendly emulation, with 
her quota of exhibits. Her people, by and through Legislative enactment, 
appropriated the sum of $35,000.00 to aid in furnishing an exhibit of her varied industries and resources, worthy of the State at this Trans-Mississippi 
Exposition, and this Building erected under the supervision of the Commission appointed by the Governor of the State in furtherance of the object 
sought by the people of the State, I, as Chairman of the Commission, now 
tender to you Governor Shaw, that you may dedicate it to the use and purpose for which it was designed.</p> 

<p>The contract for the construction of this beautiful home of the people 
of Iowa and their neighbors and friends of sister States, was awarded to 
Mr. P. H. Wind, of Council Bluffs, for the sum of $7,795.00, sixty-three days 
ago. A few years since, six months would have been considered a short 
time to erect such a structure. Mr. Wind is entitled to great credit for the 
energy displayed in rushing the work to completion in spite of the elements.</p> 

<p>The plans for the building were prepared by the Josselyn &amp; Taylor Co., 
of Cedar Rapids.</p> 

<p>The Commission desire to express their many obligations to President 
Wattles for the many courtesies shown them and assistance rendered in 
prosecution of their work. President Wattles and his able corps of assistants are entitled to great praise for the conception, planning and con;struction of this beautiful city, and wc predict it will be the most successful Exposition yet held.</p>

<p>CHAIRMAN PACKARD THEN SPOKE AS FOLLOWS:—</p>

<p>As Chairman of, and in behalf of the Committee that has had charge 
of the erection of the Building, the preparation and installation of the Exhibits which may be seen in the Agricultural and Horticultural Buildings, 
it becomes the duty, and it is a pleasure, to record the distinguished and 
loyal service which has been rendered to the people of the State by those 
to whom this special work has been entrusted. The di-awings of our Exhibits in the Agricultural and Horticultural Buildings w-ere made by D. E. 
Milward, formerly residing at Sioux City. Detailed plans and specifications 
of the structure in the Agricultural Building were prepared by our architects, and the structure was put in plar-e by our builder, Mr. P. H. Wind, 
of Council Bluffs. Upon this structure Mr. Milward has worked out, in 
natural product decorations, an Exhibit of our farm products, which we now 
offer in competition with the other States.</p> 

<p>While admiring the picture which Mr. Milward has so well executed in 
that display, the visitor must not overlook the excellence of the grains, 
grasses and other products which have thus been put on exhibition, but 
should minutely examine the specimens that have been selected by some of 
our best farmers, and it will not be invidious to name in this connection 
Mr. L. G. Clute, of Delaware County, to whom the Committee feels indebted 
for his services, both in the selection and the arrangement of the materials, and the assistance which he has given Mr. Milward in placing the 
specimens on exhibition. Mr. Milward was also given the contract to decorate the walls and ceilings of our State Building, and provide a structure 
for and to decorate our space in the Horticultural Building. The display of 
Orchard and Garden Fruits has been put in place under the immediate superintendence of Mr. A. F. Collman, wth an able corps of assistants.</p> 

<p>It has taken but a little over two months to install the Agricultural 
and Horticultural Exhibits.</p> 

<p>All the members of the Iowa Commission, in this public way, wish to 
express to our Superintendent and Secretary, F. N. Chase, their entire confidence in his judgment, their admiration for the judicious care with which 
lie has superintended the work entrusted to the Commission by the Legislature of our State. The oversight of the execution of the builders contract 
for this Building and the structure in the Agricultural Building, also the installation of the two exhibits before mentioned, and all the minute details 
involved in the economical expenditure of this money has taxed the strength
but never the genial nature of our dear friend, whom it gives us pleasure 
to cordially thank for his great success in bringing to completion, in so 
brief a time, this important public enterprise.</p> 

<p>To Mr. Wilcox, the florist of Council Bluffs, who produced the cornucopra, 
this floral horn of plenty, which is at our door, and a display of the florists art that may be seen on the Iowa space in the Horticultural Building, 
we commend, though not as effectually in words as his own work would 
serve to do.</p> 

<p>To the staff of Secretary Chase, we express our pleasurable anticipation 
of their loyal service in making the Iowa Building a home indeed to our 
people as well as those visitors whom we expect to see resting in and about 
the portals of our Building.</p> 

<p>To the Governor and his associates of the Executive Council, who are 
"by law required to, and have advised and approved the plans of the Commission and the expenditure i-esulting, in thus bringing to the Exposition 
this testimonial of the love our State bears to her sister State of Nebraska, 
where so many of our former citizens have found a home, the Commission desires to tender their thanks for the confidence which you have given us. 
Every voucher of expenditure which we send for your approval is laden with 
our reciprocal confidence and esteem.</p> 

<p>To President Wattles and the others associated with him in the manage-ment of the Exposition, the Commission tender their thanks. We shall aid 
in promoting the music "now so dear to your hearts—the click of the turnstile. Iowa will pour her thousands through your gates and they will en-

joy
a study of the great problem you have prepared for them, this Exhibition of the boundless resources of the West.</p>

<p>It only remains for me to now tender to you, Governor Shaw, in the 
name of the Commission, this Building for dedication.</p> 

<p>DEDICATED BY HON. LESLIE M. SHAAV, GOVERNOR.</p> 

<p>Governor Shaw accepted the Building in the name of the State and 
turned it over to the Exposition in the following brief address:</p> 

<p>"The State of Iowa, through its representative, accepts at the hands of 
the Iowa Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Commission this 
Building designed by its direction and erected under its supervision. It may 
not be inappropriate to tarry in this presence to make public acknowledgment of the faithful and expeditious services thus far rendered by the members of this Commission; services sure to be appreciated by those at whose 
behest they were performed. And now as the representative of the people 
of the State of Iowa, I hereby dedicate this edifice to the purposes for 
which it was designed, and commit the same to the care, custody and use 
of the* President and Management of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition in the hope that it may add somewhat to the interest 
and comfort of those who may visit these spacious grounds and enjoy the 
trophies of State and national prosperity and greatness."</p> 

<p>ACCEPTANCE BY HON. CURDON W. WATTLES, PRESIDENT TRANS-
MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION.</p> 

<p>President Wattles responded on behalf of the Exposition Management. 
He spoke as follows:</p> 

<p>"During the last ten days it has been my official duty and pleasure to 
speak of the resources, progress and splendid achievements of a number of 
Western States at the dedicatory exercises of the buildings they have 
erected on these grounds. I may be pardoned for the sentiments of pride 
and gratification I feel today and for the expression of these sentiments 
in the few words I shall say regarding the State in which twenty-five years 
of my life wei'e spent, and in the acknowledgment I desire to make of the 
assistance of this State to the great enterprise I have the honor to represent. During the early history of this Exposition, when doubt still lingered 
in the minds of many as to its advantages and possibilities, and while the 
dark clouds of financial embarrassment and the devastating effects of drouth 
still hung over the West, casting their gloom over all new enterprises, and 
for the time obscuring the sunlight of hope and prosperity, at this time when 
many of our own citizens discouraged and disheartened, were ready to 
abandon this enterprise, when our nation was borrowing gold from Europe 
to protect its credit and when the evil influences of inflation and speculation had destroyed for the time the financial reputation of the West, then 
it was that the Legislature of the great State of Iowa, the first of all the 
Trans-Mississippi States to act, by joint resolution asked the Congress of 
the United States to recognize this Exposition and make an appropriation 
for a Government Building and an exhibit here. To this act of the General Assembly of Iowa, supplemented by the efficient work of your Representatives and Senators in Congress, must be given the credit of having extended this Exposition a helping hand in its greatest need.</p> 

<p>"The Commission appointed to represent the State of Iowa here has done 
its work with credit to itself and the State. This magnificent Building with 
its broad verandas, artistic design and complete appointments, speaks 
louder than words in praise of their work. It will furnish a home for the 
weary, a meeting place for friends, and will return to the State a thousand fold its cost in promoting the interests of the State and advertising the 
enterprise and hospitality of its people throughout the land. I commend 
its design, the completeness of its appointments, the wisdom of its conception, and for the Management of this Exposition I accept and dedicate 
It to the purposes for which it has been erected."</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.097.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.097.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.097.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>"We naturally expect from such a State eloquence like that of Cousins 
and Dolliver, statesmanship like that of Allison and Gear, philanthropy like 
that of Drake, leadership like that of the Clarksons, and executive ability 
like that of Kirkwood, Boies and Shaw; and while in the history of the 
State of Iowa there are no Lincolns, Grants or Shermans, its history is replete with the names of many whose wisdom and statesmanship in times of 
peace, and courage and leadership in times of war, have re-ndered to the nation services invaluable. During the late Rebellion her soldiers were distinguished for their bravery and endurance. These men were gathered from the 
farms of this then pioneer State, and they were endowed with the splendid 
physique and the intelligence and morality which pioneer life in the broad 
prairies of the West inspires. Their bravery in battle, their endurance and 
the ability of their leaders was second to that of no other Northern State. 
And so we are not surprised when we read that among the gallant crew 
that w-ent down with the battleship, the Maine, the names of several men 
from Iowa are found; nor are we surprised that when from 4,000 brave soldiers a crew was selected to man a ship which was to sail into the harbor 
of Santiago, to face the fire of Spanish guns and meet almost certain 
death, one of Iowa's sons was chosen.</p> 

<p>"It might be said that a State with such magnificent resources, with 
such a history and with such a people, there would be no need to advertise to the world at an Exposition of this character; but when we consider 
that with the same density of population as the State of Massachusetts, 
Iowa can provide homes for 15,000,000 inhabitants and when we consider that 
but a small percentage of the manufactures consumed in the State are 
manufactured there, that with the increase of wealth and population, a 
higher civilization than has ever been known in the world will come from 
the environments of citizenship under the advantages which already exist 
within this State, we can realize the importance and necessity of promoting 
and developing these resources to the fullest extent."</p> 

<p>After a selection by the chorus, Major S. H. M. Byers read an Exposition Ode, composed by himself, for the occasion.</p>

<p>ADDRESS BY HON. JOHN N. BALDWIN.</p> 

<p>Hon. John N. Baldwin, of Council Bluffs, the orator of the day, was introduced and delivered an eloquent ad Iress. Among other things, he said:</p> 

<p>"As I wandered through the Exposition buildings and strolled over these 
Grotmds I heard orators proclaiming from the exedra, the Plaza and rostrums in State buildings the glories and triumphs of their respective States. One evening after a storm I stood on the bridge of the lagoon but a few feet 
distant from the spot where only a year ago we laid the cornerstone of this 
great enterprise, and beholding this mighty monument to the skill, courage 
and enterprise of the men of Nebraska ,I thought what has Iowa, or what 
has Iowa done to compare with this?</p> 

<p>"I came Nebraska Day and heard that distinguished citizen of the republic, whose heart in love and tongue tipped with silver eloquently presented 
the record of the resources and progress of Nebraska; I came Illinois Day 
and heard the representatives of that great commonwealth give their report 
of the work and worth of Illinois, concluding with the claim to the undisputed title to the possession of the third greatest commercial center of the 
world; I imagined that on New York Day Bourke Cochran would so portray 
the history and glories of the great State of New York that we should all 
seem to hear the Siblys chanting the springtime of the greatest empire on 
earth. Again I thought, what has Iowa, or what has Iowa done, to compare 
with all these?</p> 

<p>"Reflecting on all that I had seen a.id heard and imagined, I venerated 
my office and would have despaired of my performance had not the power 
of my subject made me bold in such a presence to plead my thotights. It 
would be the drivel of idiocy, unbecoming a gentleman and unworthy of 
the States, should I on this occasion make any statement not based upon 
careful investigation and not founded upon incontrovertible facts. I now and 
here assert, my heart beating with pride at the utterance, that, measured 
by the standard of religion, education, prosperity, patriotism, liberty, or 
any great principle or idea that makes men better, nobler and happier, Iowa, 
in the union of States, is the peer of all, superior to many and excelled

the younger and present generation. It belongs to us to protect, preserve 
and improve. We must take up the work where the pioneers were compelled 
to let it go. They placed high the standard. Let us never lower it. Let us 
look up and listen; look forward and move. Let our every action be 
prompted and performed in accordance with that design created by one of 
the greatest philosophers and poets,</p>

<p>"I propose this sentiment: The State of Iowa, with a people possessing affections deeper even than her soil; actuated by purposes broader even 
than her prairies, and inspired by aims loftier even than her hills, she 
stands today first in the union of States in general contentment, in more 
evenly distributed wealth, and in universal prosperity."</p> 

<p>"The Battle Hymn of the Republic" was sung by the chorus, and Governor Holcomb was introduced by Chairman Packard. His remarks were general in their nature and application, and the conclusion was warmly applauded. After the conclusion of the exercises the speakers, the members of 
the Iowa Commission and the guests of the occasion were entertained at 
luncheon at the viaduct cafe, after which the visitors inspected the exhibits of Iowa products in the Agriculture and Horticulture Buildings.</p> 

<p>At 5:30 p. m. a reception in honor of Governor and Mrs. Shaw was held 
in the Iowa Building, during which hundreds of people shook the hand of 
Iowa's Chief Executive and his wife, bringing to a close a day which was 
universally voted to be a great success in every respect.</p> 

<p>The weather was delightful and Iowa gave the Exposition a larger attendance than had been on the grounds since the opening day of the Exposition.</p>

<p>DEDICATION OF THE WIGWAM.</p> 

<p>Pottawattamie County Adds Its Big Tepee to the Exposition.</p> 

<p>The dedication of the Wigwam erected by the Council Bluffs and Pottawattamie County Exposition Association near the Iowa Building took 
place at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon in order to allow the visitors to attend 
this ceremony as weCl as the dedication of the State Buildings. The tall 
yellow Wigwam was crowded with people from Council Bluffs, Pottawattamie 
County and other Iowa points when President A. C. Graham called the assemblage to order and introduced Rev. G. W. Snyder of the English Lutheran Church of Council Bluffs, who delivered the invocation. President 
Graham then expressed the thanks of the Pottawattamie County Committee for the assistance which had been rendered the committee by the people 
of Pottawattamie County and Council Bluffs in the way of money and in 
other substantial ways. Mayor Victor Jennings of Council Bluffs was the 
first speaker. He said:</p> 

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: We have met here today to dedicate to the uses 
of this great and grand Exposition this contribution from Pottawattamie 
County and the City of Council Bluffs. As the head of the municipal organization of that city it becomes my duty, as it is my pleasure, to speak for 
her on this occasion.</p> 

<p>To those familiar with the beauties of Coimcil Bluffs, who know of its 
enterprise and thrift, who are proud to claim a place in its citizenship, it is 
unnecessary for me to enter into detais. To those, however, who simply
know that there is a city called Council Bluffs, but who have not tested its 
hospitalities nor witnessed the unfolding of its many and varied industries, 
it affords me gratification to say that within gunshot of this spot, yet hidden almost compDetely by "the eternal hills," lies a city of 30,000 intelligent, 
industrious, contented and happy people. It is the capital city of the 
largest county in the state, a county containing 582,1.56 acres of the richest 
land on the face of the globe. It is second, if, indeed, it is not the first city 
in the world in the magnitude of its agricultural implement trade. "Implement Row," comprising blocks upon blocks of mammoth warehouses into 
which the roads from the east pour trainloads of implements dai!Iy, and out 
of which these same goods go daily by the dozen lines of railroads to almost every quarter section of this great Trans-Mississippi territory. It is 
a city of schools and churches, and its educational and moral tone is second to that of no city of its size in tie United States. It is a city of fair 
women and brave men, as attested by the avidity with which its daughters 
are taken from the homes of their parents to homes of which they are the 
inspiration and the head, and by the number of soldier boys it has contributed to Uncle Sam's armies.</p> 

<p>This city of Council Bluffs, anxious to contribute in material way to 
the success of this Trans-Mississippi Exposition, and, because of its nearness, feeling an almost proprietary interest in it, unanimously determined 
at the very inception of this great undertaking—the fruition of which we are 
witnessing today—to be fittingly represented here. This determination led 
to the purchase of stock of the exposition, to the calling of public meetings 
and the or.e-anization of an association whose duty it should be to see to it 
that Council Bluffs should be seen and known by all who came within 
these enchanted grounds during the period of the Exposition. It was a 
difficult task assigned to these men. but nobly have they discharged it.</p> 

<p>The Wigwam tells better than can words of mine the wonderful, the 
miraculous development of this Trans-Mississippi country. The footfall 
of the red man, following his well known trails, has given place to the 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.103.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.103.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.103.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

whirl of the electric motor as it moves along the glistening lines of steel.. 
The smoke of the "Wigwam" has faded away before the smoke from factory and force. The silence of natural peace has gone forever, succeeded 
by the never-ending hum of industry. Ihe plains and valleys are no longer 
the waste places of the earth, but have been made the garden spots and 
graneries of the world.</p> 

<p>To the purposes of this Exposition this "Wigwam is to day given. To 
the city which gives it in part I cordially invite you. The trails are 
plainer than they were a half century ago and the hearts of our people, 
like the doors of their "Wigwams," are ever open to you. We want you 
to come and break bread with us, smoke with us the pipe of peace, rest 
body and mind in the prettiest parks between the two ranges of mountains, and, going back over the y-ars, find a new meaning in Longfellow's lines:</p>

<span class="lg poem"><span class="l">Very spacious was the Wigwam,</span> 
<span class="l">Made of deerskin dressed and whitened.</span> 
<span class="l">With the gods of the Dakotas.</span> 
<span class="l">Drawn and painted on its curtains.</span></span> 

<p>Spencer Smith, one of the pioneer lawyers of Council Bluffs, spoke at 
length of the hardships and experiences of the pioneer of the prairie. 
Judge Walter I. Smith, a member of the district bench of Pottawattamie 
County, was the next speaker. He spoke rapidly, sketching the history 
of Pottawattamie County and passing quickly to the present status of affairs in the county, referring to the mortality statistics as showing that 
the average life of the man who takes up his residence in Council Bluffs 
is 150 years. In closing he welcomed the people to the Wigwam and invited them to make it their home. The music for the occasion was furnished by the Apollo Mandolin Club of Council Bluffs, an organization of 
young men, who delighted the audience with the excellence of their playing.</p> 

<p>ASSOCIATION MEETINGS.</p> 

<p>During the term of the Exposition there were a number of conventions 
and reunions of Iowa Organizations and Societies held in the Press room 
and in the Commissioners' room of the Iowa Building, and at different times 
the use of the building was tendered to the representatives of other States 
who had no State Building on the Exposition Grounds.</p> 

<p>Your Committee commenced early to make their plans for the Iowa 
Celebration which was to occur on the 21st of September. They planned 
to make it an ideal Iowa demonstration. Your Committee planned to 
have a large number of the bands from different counties in the state in 
attendance at that time and opened correspondence with the County Auditors and Mayors of the principal cities with this end in view. They also 
entered into negotiations with the railroads of the State of Iowa with request to transport all uniformed bands to the Exposition for that occasion 
free of charge.</p> 

<p>Your Committee also requested a uniform rate over the entire state of one 
cent per mile and a six days limit. The railroad companies at a late date 
made rates nearly as I'equested by your committee and granted the limit 
asked for, but they declined to transport the bands free.</p> 

<p>The press of the State heartily responded to calls made up on them for 
advertising Iowa State Day Ceremonies.</p> 

<p>A. brief synopsis of the plan of the Committee was submitted to the 
Executive Committee for their approval and was adopted.</p> 

<p>The exercises of the Celebration Day were preceded on the evening of 
the 20th by a dinner given by the Iowa Commission in honor of Governor 
Shaw, the Iowa State Officers, our Senators and Representatives in Congress, the President and Board of Management of the Exposition, the Commissioners of the several states and territories participating 
in the Exposition, and others.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.104.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.104.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.104.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>At this dinner, (the President being absent), Chairman Packard presided and the following addresses were made, which were highly complimentary to our State and Nation.</p> 

<p>SPEECHES.</p> 

<p>Omaha Club Room, Tuesday evening, September 20, 1898. 
The following is a stenographic report of the proceedings: 
In the opening post-prandial exercises Hon. S. B. Packard, toastmaster, bade the guests w^elcome, an announced that the banquet was given 
by the Iowa Commission in honor of Governor Leslie M. Shaw and State 
Officers, the President and other officers of the Exposition and the Commissioners of the several States and Territories.</p> 

<p>The Male Quartet from Council Bluffs sang, "Comrades in Arms, Win 
the Fight."</p> 

<p>When the cigars were lighted Toastmaster Packard called on the male 
Quartette.</p>

<p>Toastmaster Packard introduced Senator Allen as follows:</p> 

<p>Gentlemen: The story is too long to tell all at once, the way in which 
Iowa started to come lo the Exposition, but with your patience we will 
gradually unroll, so that you will see how it came about.</p> 

<p>One of the first things in a matter of this sort is to know how this 
great Exposition got its start, and we are fortunate in having with us tonight the gentleman who originated and offei'ed the bill which finally 
passed, asking Congress to make an appropriation for ihis great International Exposition. And we are fortunate again that this is an Iowa gentleman that w-e loaned to Nebraska. I have gi-eat pleasure in introducing Senator Allen, to respond to the toast, "Congress and the Exposition."</p> 

<p>SENATOR WILIAM V. ALLEN.</p> 

<p>Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: My life has been a life of surprises.</p> 

<p>I came here this forenoon for the express purpose of doing what I could 
to entertain 5'ou gentlemen from Iowa, assisting our friends from Omaha, 
as far as I had the capacity to do so, but with not the slightest idea of 
having anything to say, notwithstanding it is charged against me that I 
hold the Avorld's record for long distance heel and toe talking. (Applause 
and laughter.)</p> 

<p>The origin of this bill is not a matter of very great importance.</p> 

<p>Nebraska, as you know, has been suffering, or had suffered somewhat from an unhappy concatination of circumstances, not necessary now 
to be mentioned, for we are a young and struggling commonwealth, we did 
not have the age that Iowa has, and age counts for much in the experience of a State. It was deemed by us, at a meeting of the TransMississippi Congress, held in November, 1895, I think, that a TransMississippi and International Exposition should be held in Omaha. I do 
not think any of us had a clear conception of the magnitude of the enterprise at that time. It had been agitated some time before that by the 
newspapers of this city, and by prominent citizens, and, finally, it took 
definite shape. An organization was formed, the stockholders of which 
resided in Omaha.</p> 

<p>The President of the company will be able to tell you more about that 
than I can. And we then made an appeal to Congress to give it national 
recognition and an appropriation.</p> 

<p>I had the honor of drafting the bill, a very simple affair, and introducing it in the senate, and we were fortunate in having my distinguished 
colleague as the chairman of the committee to which it was referred.</p> 

<p>You can very well see, then, the first step in the programme.</p> 

<p>It was reported favorably and, with some amendments, placed on it 
by your distinguished senior Senator, it passed the Senate and went to the 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.105.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.105.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.105.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

House of Representatives, where, after a time, and a great deal of labor, 
it passed, and was signed, a few hours before the adjournment of Congress, by Mr. Cleveland.</p>

<p>The history of this enterprise is better known by President Wattles, 
and those more intimately connected with it. than I could possibly know.</p> 

<p>I may say to you gentlemen, that this enterprise is not only a pet of 
Omaha, it is a pet of Nebraska, and it is a pet, I believe and favorite of the 
entire Mississippi and Missouri basin.</p> 

<p>I am frank to say that I did not have myself a clear conception of the 
possible magnitude of this enterprise, and I never had a clear conception 
of it until today, and I have not been through it yet. My colleague here 
toted me off down the Midway, and kept me almost all the afternoon, and 
I did not see all that was to be seen.</p> 

<p>Senator Thurston—I never had a better stayer.</p> 

<p>Senator Allen—The history of this bill. I believe, or, from the passage 
of this bill, dates a new era in the history, not only of the State of Nebraska, but in the history of the State of Iowa.</p> 

<p>I may say to you gentlemen from Iowa that I first set my foot on Iowa 
soil forty-two years ago. It was a new State at that time, and I have not 
lost my affection for Iowa, by any means although I am frank to say toyou, if I were compelled to make a choice between Iowa and that younger 
and, in some respects, brighter Commonwealth of Nebraska, I would 
cling to Nebraska soil. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>It is the beginning of a new era of prosperity, in my judgment. I 
mean general prosperity. Not the kind we were talking about a couple of 
years ago. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>It brings the people of these great Western States more closely in contact with one another than they have been before. Much of the trouble, 
much of the difficulty that has come to the people of the United States, 
has been in consequence of their hitherto isolated positions.</p> 

<p>I frankly believe, if I may be permitted to refer to the fact, that if we 
had had the close communication with the South, thirty years ago, we 
would not have had the great struggle through which we passed, and 
if all the people of this country were to be brought more closely in contact 
with one another, and this great enterprise is not only bringing people 
from Iowa here, who are our neighbors and great friends, but it is 
bringing people from all sections of the Union, from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific and fi'om Canada to the Gulf. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>That it is educational, no one can deny.</p> 

<p>A person would have to be extremely stupid that would visit this 
great White City located at Omaha and make a study of the Expositionand the articles put upon exhibition there, that did not learn many valuable lessons from what he saw. It is educational not only for the generation to which you and I belong, but it is supremely educational to the impressionable youth of this country that may attend it. And whatever I 
may have done, which is little, in making it a success, I shall always regard, with some degree of pride, the fact that I was, in some measure, 
connected with its inception and its success.</p> 

<p>You must understand, gentlemen from Iowa, that out here in Nebraska 
we are in love with one another. All sections of this state are in perfect 
accord with all other sections in the state. We have our political battles. 
We have our contentions. We have our struggles among ourselves. But 
when it touches, when anything affects the welfare of Nebraska, its 
commercial or its agricultural or its educational advantages, we are all one. 
There is no Populism then, no Republicanism, no Democracy. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>And those of us who reside in the interior of the State, and I speak as one 
who lives in the interior of this state, those of us who reside in the in

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.106.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.106.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.106.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

terior of Nebraska are in love with the progress and the enterprise of this 
commercial city and center of our State. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>In this center is poured much of the wealth produced from the soil of 
Nebraska, and as long as the merchants and the business men of Omaha 
are as .iust and generous to our people as they have been, in the laps will 
be poured the wealth of this commonwealth in the years that are to come.</p> 

<p>Now, I do not desire to take any more of your attention. I enjoy 
myself best, strange as it may seem, when I talk least.</p> 

<p>I am glad to see you here.</p> 

<p>As a citizen of this state I desire to extend you a hearty welcome to 
Omaha. The doors of Omaha and the doors of Nebraska are open to you. 
You are our friends and our brethren. You are here as our guest, to 
enable us to make this enterprise more successful than it has been heretofore, though it has been a great success, and as such we appreciate your 
visit, and we will do all we can to make your stay among us a pleasant 
and profitable stay. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>Toastmaster Packard—I cannot say, like the. Senator, that I am not prepared. I cannot make that excuse, because I have got it all in my pocket, 
and the excuse would not be correct, and when I fire a shot, etc. In other 
words, I give every man a change to enjoy his dinner without any fear that 
he is going to be called out.</p> 

<p>I suppose the next subject on the programme should be the one to bring 
us down to the main work and to an understanding of the great task that 
has been accomplished, in raising the money, in preparing this grand Exposition, and to do that*there is one man with us here tonight who can tell 
us all about how this was done. And I want you all to stand and drink 
to the health of President Wattles, who will respond to the toast, "Omaha 
and the Exposition."</p> 

<p>The male quarete from Council Bluffs sang "For He Is a Jolly Good Fellow."</p> 

<p>MR. GURDON W. WATTLES.</p> 

<p>I had hoped and had asked to to be excusd from making any remarks 
this evening, and had supposed, until I was just notified a few moments ago 
that my request had been granted. I am not an extemporaneous speaker 
and until connected with this Exposition, for fifteen years, had not attempted to make a public address.</p> 

<p>However, as I feel that I am among my friends tonight, I do not feel 
that hesitation that I sometimes do a nong strangers.</p> 

<p>Twenty-five years of the best years of my life were spent in Iowa. To 
the public schools and colleges of that State I owe my education. To the 
splendid advantages and resources and opportunities offered by that State, 
I owe whatever success I may have attained in business. In that State are 
many of my old acquaintances and many of my nearest relatives, and in 
the soil of the State of Iowa lies my only child.</p> 

<p>I therefore feel a fellow feeling today, and as the Iowa Day approaches 
a pleasure that I have not felt in anticipating any other State day celebration at this Exposition.</p> 

<p>But I am to talk of Omaha and tha Exposition. The history is so old 
and has been so often told that it seems almost treadbare.</p> 

<p>The year 1892 was a year of panic throughout the land.</p> 

<p>It was followed in Nebraska by failure of crops, by a drouth such as 
had never been known before, business failures throughout the State and 
in this city had reached their maximum in 1895, and business men were 
discouraged and disheartened. And whan the proposition was made by the 
Commercial Congress that met in this State to hold here in 1898 a great 
Exposition of the resources and wealth and progress of the Trans-Mississippi States and Territories, it was thought by many of our most conservative men that the task was too great and that the time was not opportune. 
The resolution passed the Commercial Congress to hold this Exposition. 
This Congress was composed of all the States and Territories West of the 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.107.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.107.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.107.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Mississippi, but the Immediate ^vork of this Exposition devolved upon the 
citizens of Omaha. An organization was perfected. Officers were elected. 
But the discouragements were so great that even the officers, at first composed of the Board of Directors of this Exposition, were almost ready to 
give up the enterprise. Our business men, many of them, advised against 
it, and we finally agreed among ourselves that we would go on with the 
preliminary organization, and if we could secure national aid and a national appropriation we would carry the work forward to completion.</p> 

<p>How this aid was secured has just been told by Senator Alien. 
After a fight in Congress, such as had never been seen before, on a measure of this kind, after efforts, which Speaker Reed acknowledged, after the 
bill passed, had never been equaled, in the passage, and in the requests, in 
the number of requests for the passage of the measure, the bill, finally, on 
the last day of Congress, became a law, and a great jubilee was celebrated 
in this city immediately thereafter, and from that day really began this 
great work of building this great enterprise.</p> 

<p>When I returned from Washington, where I went to do what little I could 
in assistance to our worthy Congressman, to secure a favorable report on this 
bill from the Ways and Means Committee in the House, when I returned and 
told our people that a condition had been added, by the Chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee, providing that we must raise two hundred 
and fifty thousand dollars, in stock subscriptions, before the Government appropriation would be available, many were disheartened and discouraged, 
said it never could be done. But many of our business men felt that when the 
night was darkest and when the skies were overhung with clouds was the 
time for the most supreme effort. They felt that by gathering here the resources and the wealth and the produce of this Western country, and inviting the people of the East to come and see what the West really was and 
what it could produce, we would correct many of the false impressions and 
reports that gone out regarding this State and regarding the other Western 
States. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>They were, therefore, spurred on to action, and, after a long and hard 
canvass among the business men of this city, our committees met and compared notes, and we found that instead of two hundred and fifty thousand 
dollars, required by Congress, that we had already subscribed more than 
four hundred thousand dollars. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>Those of us who were most intimately connected with the plans of this 
enterprise well knew that two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and 
even four hundred thousand dollars, would, in no wise, build an Exposition 
worthy of the West. The work went on. the railroads were solicited. They 
came to our aid in the most generous manner. The Burlington road was 
the first, and it subscribed thirty thou'^and dollars; this was followed by an 
equal amount by the Northwestern, annd the other roads leading to this 
city all subscribed in a most liberal manner, until we finally raised by stock 
subscriptions and donations in this community alone about six hundred 
thousand dollars. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>The plans of the Exposition Buildings were drawn and the work began. 
We did not know where the remainder of the money was to come from, but 
we went on as best we could, and carried out the plans that have been consummated in the beautiful design which has been the pleasure and the admiration of all visitors, until today, the corporation, organized in this city, 
and upon whose shoulders the active work has been placed, has raised and 
expended one million and three hundred thousand dollars, in round figures. 
They do not owe a dollar. The corporation is practically out of debt. The 
Exposition was in bond for a time. It has been built by Omaha capital, 
by Omaha labor, supplemented, of course, by the work that has been done 
In outside States. All appropriations of States and Territories, the general 
Government, and of foreign nations, has gone to build the buildings of these 
municipalities and States and countries, and not into the general fund. Even 
our own State, that appropriated one hundred thousand dollars, has expended every dollar of it through a commission appointed by the Governor of 
this State. The active work has been done by Omaha people, and to the

generosity and labor and brain and architectural designing we can credit 
forever the great success that this enterprise has achieved.</p> 

<p>It may be out of place, at a meeting of this kind, where people from an, 
outside State are the principal guests of the occasion, to speak in this manner of the people of the city in which I live. But I want to say that to the 
pc-ople of this city will forever stand the credit of not only showing to theworld that in a time of trouble and discouragement we were brave enough, 
and strong enough to come forward to the rescue of our own city, but thejr 
were brave enough and strong enough and willing to put up the money necessary to protect the credit and to forvrard the interests of the entire West, 
(Applause.)</p> 

<p>The Chairman—We will call upon the quartet. It is an Iowa quartet.</p> 

<p>The quartet responded to the request of the Chairman with this song:: 
"Still and Lonely Must I Go; O, Star, Thy Loving Smile Bestow."</p> 

<p>Chairman Packard—I am going to give you something now to awaken 
the pride which every one has in the toast of "Our Nation." And we haveT/ith us here tonight a most eminent statesman of this country, whom we 
are fortunate in having, and whom I now call upon to respond. I refer toSenator Thurston, senior Senator of Nebraska. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>SENATOR JOHN M. THURSTON</p> 

<p>The Toastmaster and Gentlemen of Iowa: It is with great pleasure that 
I meet you here tonight from our neighboring State.</p> 

<p>You have already noticed that most of our eminent citizens originally 
came from Iowa. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>It may not be out of place to suggest that they appeared here almost 
simultaneously with the passage of the prohibitory law. (Applause and laughter.)</p> 

<p>We are very familiar with most of your citizens who live within a radius of one hundred miles from Omaha. They are frequent and welcome visitors.</p> 

<p>I am faced tonight with a sentiment that would appal any one called 
upon to respond to it, "Our Nation." Why, gentlemen, we do not even know 
the boundaries of the United States today. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>The last few months we have leapad the seas, and our flag flies on twocontinents, instead of one, and if Dewey had one more Spanish fleet to follow. God knows how far our dominion might have been extended. (Applause.)</p>

<p>We are not a people of conquest. The words dominion and conquest have 
not been known in our national vocabulary. And, yet, from the beginning 
of the Republic up to the present time, what wonderful strides we have 
made, not only in civilization and general advancement, but in the scope of 
territory that the American people have from time to time added to the 
original thirteen colonies and the adjacent territory. Here, even, where you 
and I both live, was not a part of the United States at the beginning of 
the nineteenth century. For, by one grand acquisition, in 1804, we brought 
under the Stars and Stripes over two-thirds of the area of the United States 
the area that today has placed in tha diadem of the nation's banner almost one-third of its glittering stars. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>Our present position as a nation, in the extension of our boundaries 
and of our jurisdiction, has not been one of our own seeking. Whatever we 
may add to the domain of the United States, the world will acquit us of 
any seeking for territory. The great struggle, which is now so fortunately 
and happily and gloriously closed, was not undertaken to acquire foreign 
lands, to take in the islands of the Gulf or of the further seas, but it waff 
done in response to the resistless demand of the consciences of the American people that humanity should be relieved from the burdens and the oppressions of tyranny of a foreign government upon the Western Hemisphere. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>And today, whatever will come to us of this great struggle, in the 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.109.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.109.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.109.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

way of territory, it will not come to us of our seeking-, but as the inevitable logic of the situation, and the responsibility that will attach to the 
American people will come to them unsought.</p> 

<p>I don't know what may be the policy of this Government in its settlement of the g-reat issue with the country of Spain.</p> 

<p>I do know that we have secured, because we could not prevent it, and I 
don't think we would have cared to prevent it if we could, the splendid 
island of Porto Rico.</p> 

<p>I do not know what the policy of this Government will be as to the extension of our domain in the Pacific seas.</p> 

<p>I do know this, that it was no part of the purpose of the United States to 
seek dominion there.</p> 

<p>Dewey's fleet sailed into the harbor of Manila, not seeking land, not seekacquisition, but simply as an inevitable result of the war that was upon us, to put an end to the fleet that threatened the interests of our beloved country </p>

<p>For my part. I have been most cautioun ar.d cor.servative in thought 
and action. I confess that I have looked with apprehension upon a departure from the old established theories of our Government. I have viewed 
with concern and I have hesitatingly cast my influence and my vote in favor of any proposition for an acquisition of foreign territory.</p> 

<p>But new responsibilities have come to us as a people.</p> 

<p>Sometimes when I look back upon the history of this country, bounding 
up, as it does, the mag^nificent progress of this world of ours, I have been 
inclined to believe that the guiding finger of Providence may have directed 
the fleets of the United States in the foreign seas, and that it is God's will 
and God's doing that the flag of the United States floats over more people, 
for their salvation and their uplifting, than we ever expected it would. 
(Applause.)</p> 

<p>I do know this, that whatever we may retain in our neighboring gulf; 
whatever our administration may retain in the further seas; I do know 
Ihis, that there are no people on the face of the earth to whom the responsibility of the government of new lands can be entrusted than to the American people. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>I do know this, too, that as a nation we have grown before the world. 
I do know that we stand today, with more power and more dignity and 
more grandeur and more respect than we have stood before. I know that 
that dear old flag of our means more to the world than it ever meant before. That flag that like our country has been a growth, a good growth, a healthy growth, a splendid growth. Why, we remember that at Yorktown, when it first became the flag of an independent people, it stood as the flag that relieved us from the dominion of kings, and for a Government of the people, by the people and for the people.</p> 

<p>We know how the dear old flag grew out at Appomattox until it became in the sky one of human liberty, and we know, too, that in this later 
growth that dear old flag at Santiago, when almost a quarter of a million 
soldiers surrendered to twenty-three thousand troops of the United States, 
that flag became something that it had never been in the sky of nations, 
"the flag of man's humanity for man. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>It waves in all its splendor on land and sea, in both hemispheres, silvering and sparkling on the empyrean blue, kissed by the sun of day and 
?wooed by the stars at night, feared by tyrants, beloved by mankind, our 
triumphant flag, the flag of the greatest nation on earth. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>God's providence is in it all, and has been from the beginning. No man 
can read the history of the world without reaching the belief that this providence reserved this new land through all the sufferings and early struggles 
of the human race, reserved it until, in the fullness of time, a people should 
come to live upon it, fitted and strengthened by great long ages of combat 
and of progress to people it in a better way and for better purposes than 
anv other land had ever been peopled before.</p>

<p>The ancients believed in an Arcadian realm toward which those be more 
less favored of the Gods might sail o.i golden seas, and where the sun 
set beneath old ocean's wave they saw its shining strand. This is that 
land. The centuries have given it to the human race; have given it that 
those oppressed in other climes may here be free; have given it that on its 
peaceful shores earth's toiling millions may find hope and rest; have given 
it that its peaceful valleys may abound in pleasant hopes and its eternal 
hill tops glorify the goodness of all America. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>The Chairman—Gentlemen, we will now come to the State we came 
from, Iowa. We have Avith us tonight an eminent citizen of Nebraska, who 
also, was a former citizen of Iowa. How numerous they are. And this 
gentleman can give reminiscences for us. He is one of the old-timers, and 
I am going to ask him to tell us of these early days in Iowa, and I ask to 
respond to "Early Days in Iowa" Ex-Governor Saunders, of Nebraska.</p> 

<p>EX-GOVERNOR ALVIN SAUNDERS.</p> 

<p>Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen—Probably I should be able to talk of the 
early days, for I have not had so much to do with these latter days. 
(Laughter.)</p> 

<p>I went into what is called Iowa now when it was Michigan. Probably there is not any one here who was there at that time. I think probably I know more than most of you of the early settlement of that country. It was Michigan then. On the Fourth of July, I think, Michigan was 
admitted, and I was there in that territory. I was ten years in that territory before it was admitted. And I was there six or seven years after it was 
admitted, so I ought to know something of the history of that country.</p> 

<p>I assisted as a clerk to take a census in your State when it took in territory north of you up as far as St. Paul, when there was forty-one thousand people in it.</p> 

<p>Now, this country that is right across here now we did not think was 
worth anything here at that time.</p> 

<p>Now there was some land down in here called Black Hawk, Avhere the 
Black Hawk war was fought, and in 1833 it was taken and called the Black 
Hawk purchase. That is all we knew about it when we went there. I don't 
know what name it would have except that name. But finally the Indian 
Territory was extended, and in that way we kept the people going out a 
little further, and a little further afttr there was some value to it.</p> 

<p>But, gentlemen, I might state right to you here now, the first thing that 
induced me to take a hand in politics was to make the fine map that you have 
in your State. You have as good a map as there is in the whole history.</p> 

<p>But I was over at a convention that made the constitution for that 
State, that made one State here with a line that would run right between 
the two rivers here, and the two States was divided so as to make this 
State a little longer than that and that run up towards St. Paul. And I 
took a hand as a youngster. I was then postmaster at Mount Pleasant in 
Iowa, with a great many others, to try to defeat that constitution. I 
wanted it to come just where it comes now, right down to the center of 
the river on the west and to the river on the east, and we had a hard fight 
to bring- that State more than half way throug-h, but we beat it, and I 
thing by about four hundred votes only. But we beat it. And at that time 
we defeated this constitution. Up to that time I never had any thing to do
with politic at all. And they said I ought to go and help make a constitution instead of defeating it. So I was sent by the people of my county to 
help make the constitution that gives you your map as you have it today,, 
and I am a little proud of that whether you are for me or not. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>Now, gentlemen, I am not going to detain you. I am not much of a 
talker these days, and never was a very good talker, but could talk a little 
better sometimes than I could since I have had this long spell of keeping quiet.</p> 

<p>This Exposition that has been spoken of here.</p> 

<p>Our people, you have learned tonigl t who they were, have taken hold

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.111.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.111.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.111.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span> 

of this matter, and we have been backed by my people in Iowa. 
I feel a great affection for the people of Iowa.</p> 

<p>I made my first dollar, after I had left my father's home, there. I cast 
my first vote in that State that I eyer cast. I found my wife in that country, my children were born ther?, and why shouldn't I have a love for that country.</p> 

<p>Now, gentlemen, I could go on, but I do not want to do it now. I only 
want you to know that I am very glad that our Iowa people have given us 
this banquet tonight.</p> 

<p>They have done well. We have tried to do our duty at home, as you have 
learned tonight, and I feel that there is no people outside of my own State 
that are nearer to me than the Iowa people are today, and I thank you very 
kindly for this opportunity that we should have to express to you our appreciation of what you have done, and let us get together, as we have here tonight, and talk the same things and do the same things and act the same 
things and we shall be neighbors all our time and that you will be proud of 
us as we are proud of you. Applause.)</p> 

<p>The quartet sang "You Ask What Land I Love the Best."</p> 

<p>Time, 10:40 p. m.</p> 

<p>The Chairman said: We have with us tonight an eminent representative of our Supreme Court of Iowa, and in order to get you introduced to these gentlemen, I am going to give you the toast, "The Iowa Judiciary," 
and ask Judge Deemer, of the Supreme Court, to respond.</p> 

<p>JUDGE H. E. DEEMER—</p>

<p>Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen:</p> 

<p>Although it is currently reported that the Judiciary is standing sponsor for the "Midways," this is the first time, I believe, that that co-ordinate branch of Government which I have the honor to represent has had 
recognition upon any of the regular programmes.</p> 

<p>We have been so concerned with the evidences of material prosperity 
about us and with the wonderful achievements of this Western people before 
us that we have not had time to consider the social, political and judicial 
conditions which lie at the bottom of all progress.</p> 

<p>But so it has ever been. Courts come and go unheralded. They work so 
quietly, enunciate their doctrines so calmly, and proceed so deliberately 
that their influence is hardly felt; and yet I venture the assertion that had 
it not been for Judge Marshall, this Grand Exposition would have been but 
a dream.</p> 

<p>This department of Government has no patronage at its disposal, no favors to bestow, no friends to reward, and no enemies to punish—save the 
enemies of all mankind. It is at once the most potent and the most impotent branch of Government. It has mind to declare but no hand to enforce. 
It may command but it cannot compel. It may interpret but it cannot 
coerce. Its weapons are time honored precedent and inexorable logic. Its 
aim justice and truth. It never guesses more than two ways on the same 
proposition; and over in our State they say it is right about half of the 
time—and this compliment is usually bestowed by the successful litigant.</p> 

<p>It is looked upon as the impregnable bulwark of our liberties, and yet it 
is most unmercifully and unjustly criticised. I speak now of the system, and 
.not of particular courts or individual judges—and I may say parenthetically 
that I have no patience with a court that will make men work against their 
will; nor faith in an institution that will compel men to conduct their business or employ their capital at a loss. Neither have I regard for a court 
that will interfere with men in the performance of any lawful avocation; nor 
belief in a judicial system which cannot or will not protect property rights. 
I have no respect for that argument which gives to government the powerto create something out of nothing, and yet takes away from it the right toprotect that which one enjoys.</p> 

<p>But to return from my digression. From Marshall to Miller marks the

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.112.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.112.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.112.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

distance from Virginia to Iowa. From Virginia to Iowa measures the interval between the original thirteen colonies, and the fully developed nation. 
From the Alleghanies to the Louisiana purchase measures in kind the true 
limits of territorial expansion.</p> 

<p>I have chosen Marshall and Miller not simply for this figure of speech, 
but to illustrate in a measure the influence of the judiciary upon our social 
system. Marshall was the constructor, Miller the reconstructor. Marshall 
laid the foundation, Miller builded and cemented the arch. Marshall gathered up the thirteen colonies which has crystallized around the sword of 
Washington and wound about them the red and white bars typical of the 
valor of our soldiers and the purity of our intentions.</p> 

<p>Miller followed the sword of Grant and gave permanent setting to that 
ever increasing galaxy of stars which are destined to shine from the blue field 
of justice</p> 

<p>Marshall gave vigor and vitality to the young nation; Miller bound up 
its wounds, and nur.^ed it to young manhood. As you wend your way out to 
the "New White City" and pass under that magnificent Arch of States. I 
ask you to remember that but for the creative genius of Marshall and the 
constructive ability of Miller, no such triumphant memorial would have 
been possible.</p> 

<p>I have also selcted these two names because of the fact that as Marshall 
came from the old home of statesmen. Miller was appointed from the new. 
Marshall represents Virginia; Miller stands for Iowa.</p> 

<p>While it is generally conceded that Justice Miller stands at the head of 
our illustrious jurists, w'e yet have others, and have made large loans to our 
sister States. New York, Chicago and Omaha have made large drafts upon 
us, which have always been duly honored.</p> 

<p>I must not tire you with the mention of the names of all. To do so would 
unduly trench upon the exercises for the morrow and I forbear.</p> 

<p>Not only is the nation indebted to Iowa for the able jurists she has furnished, but the influence of her sons upon the growth and development of her 
sister States is beyond computation.</p> 

<p>It would not become me to speak of our present court. We frequently 
say at home that were it not for the bad precedents established by our predecessors we would have no trouble and there would be very little litigation. Over here in Nebraska, and in this exclusive company, I want to confidentially confess that we never had a better court that when Dillon, Wright 
and Cole were upon our bench. I believe, too, that the whole West has profited from their labors.</p> 

<p>We take laudable pride in the fact that we furnished Nebraska with a 
Post, not to mention the district judges of Omaha, who sat at the feet of the 
illustrious trio that I have mentioned.</p> 

<p>I know it is quite the custom to decry the courts, and to criticise opinions. The latter is perfectly proper, provided the critic has an intelligent 
conception of what he is talking about. But the statesman or politician, 
anarchist or socialist who strikes at the former has for his mark the foundation stones of our republic, and should he succeed in undermining the institution our priceless liberties are gone. The courts are the nation's safeguard.</p> 

<p>The Chairman—I am going to give you the next toast, "The Iowa Press," 
and we are fortunate in having my townsman, S. C. McFarland, editor 
and proprietor of the Times-Republican of Marshalltown, whom I shall 
ask to respond.</p> 

<p>S. C. McFARLAND.</p> 

<p>In Response to the "Iowa Press,"</p> 

<p>Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen:</p> 

<p>Coming from Iowa it is Impossible for me to say that I am entirely unprepared—this with deference to the explanations that have preceded mine. 
I did receive vague word by wire that I would be called upon to respond to a 
proposition that long range rendered more or less indefinite, and now find 
that my notes are worthless for the purpose for which they were intended. 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.113.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.113.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.113.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

The situation is pregnant with embarrassment. Within sound of the eloquence of Senator Thurston and Senator Allen, within touch of the practical enthusiasm of President Wattles, and having been endowed by nature 
with long legs, I feel like emulating the example of your native jack rabbit 
and taking to the cornfields of Nebraska.</p> 

<p>It might be taken that this toast is merely the usual and stereotyped 
acknowledgment of the power and influence of the newspaper—that most appreciated and oftimes the most discredited of all human productions. It 
might be a deference to that ancient remark of Thomas Jefferson: "I would 
rather live in a country with newspapers and without a government than in 
a country with government but without newspapers." Or it might be an 
unconscious tribute to the bitter-sweet of Wendell Phillips: "The newspaper is the parent, school, college, pulpit, theater, example and counsellor 
—all in one. Every drop of our blood is colored by it. Let me make the 
newspapers, and I care not who makes the religion and the laws." 
But it is not too much to presume, in this instance, that it is merely the recognition of the fact that, but for her newspapers Iowa would not have been 
represented at this splendid show of her sister State, nor would this banquet 
have been held tonight.</p> 

<p>It is difficult, in our personal affairs, to always adjust rightly the niceties of investment and expenditure; it is more difficult in public affairs, 
enmeshed, as they frequently are, with questions that should be entirely 
foreign—but tonight there is cause for congratulation throughout all Iowa 
that, to her credit, as a State, and to the just pride of every citizens, past 
and present, her newspapers brushed aside all selfish sophistries, and reaching across the Big Muddy, grasped the hand of Omaha, of Wattles, of Rosewater, of Saunders, of Montgomery and all those kindred spirits who looked 
failure in the face and calmly told her that she lied </p>

<p>In 1840 Iowa had but four weekly newspapers, strong and crude creations 
they would seem today. In 1850 she had twenty-seven, but still no dailies. 
Today there are published, in round numbers, 950 weeklies and 70 dailies. 
Within half a century of time no more marvelous tale has ever been told 
than the history of Iowa journalism. Its weeklies are the best and strongest 
in the nation; its dailies have long since trespassed upon the future. Within the brief scope of this response there is no time for historical analysis, 
and if there were, there are others who alone are competent to put into 
words a proper tribute to Iowa journalism—to the brain and brawn of its 
pioneers, to the enterprise and sacrifices of their successors.</p> 

<p>The modern Iowa daily is the evolution of but a very few years. Only 
yesterday perfecting machinery and type-casting and stereotyping processes 
were unknown outside the very largest cities. Today it is a poor town of 
12,000 people that hasn't a substantial, satisfying newspaper. The ponderous 
metropolitan has become almost a memory. The metropolitan daily finds 
its erstwhile undisputed field becoming more and more circumscribed. The 
processes of invention and competition have educated a new clientele; the 
development of the American idea has created new conditions of locality 
and environment, and, to meet them, out of rough experience, the inland 
daily, as we call it, has been evolved, and when you have found, behind its 
modern plant, that combination of resource and enterprise, that mental 
and moral balance, and that practical and executive ability required of the . 
successful publisher in all his acute relations to the public and to individuals, then, in my humble judgment, you have found the genius of the most 
exacting journalism that is known today.</p> 

<p>The fecundity of Iowa is not measured by her cornfields. When the 
genius of creation called into existence the two great rivers of this northern continent it was decreed that, enclosed within their borders and nestled 
between the rigors of Minnesota on the north and the miasma of Missouri 
on the south there should be spread a garden of the Gods—not a fantastic 
dream of dead volcanos and the wash of centuries, but an empire of rolling prairie and gentle stream, whose influence should be an inspiration for all 
her children, stamping them with the broad character of her own topography 
and endowing them with the vigor of her own soil. And her children have

been inspired. The pioneer press of Iowa preached the gospel of education. 
It took the boulders from the pathways of forgotten glaciers and built the 
foundation of the school house. That Iowa school house has developed 
new states, and, as you have heard so eloquently acknowledged tonight, 
its influence may be traced to the enterprise that lies beneath and the 
beauty that blossoms within Omaha's White City. It has invaded and invigorated the old commonwealth. Its .-scholars have taken, as their natural 
levitage, the most commanding places in every avocation of the nation's life,, 
and, Mr. Toastmaster, not content with producing—I was going to say the 
best, but with consideration for the feelings of Mr. Rosewater, I shall say the 
most wholesome, newspapers in the world, it has challenged the country by 
sending to and retaining in congress a delegation whose practical statesmanship dominates its councils, whose eloquence compels the world to stand still 
for a moment that it may listen, and whose membership, officially and personally, is the satisfaction and the glory of every true son who dwells 
within that charmed ground preserved, as we have heard by Ex-Governor 
Saunders, and Avhose motto, crystallizing the splendid sentiment uttered 
by Senator Thurston and coined long ago by our war Lieutenant Governor, 
Enoch Eastman, is inscribed upon that shaft of all the States at W^ashington—"Iowa, the affections of her people, like the rivers of her borders, flow 
to an inseparable union."</p> 

<p>The Chairman—Gentlemen, if mine eyes do not deceive me, far away to 
the south, in the back part of this room, we have a late arrival from Santiago de Cuba, and in order to get him out of the rear, I am going to propose a toast, "Iowa at Santiago de Cuba," and I will call on Mr. Lafaj-ette 
Young to respond.</p> 

<p>MR. LAFAYETTE YOUNG.</p> 

<p>Editor of the Iowa Capital.</p> 

<p>Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen—I arrived somewhat unexpectedly, and ani 
not in the humor that grows upon one after sitting for some time and 
partaking of the good things at the banqueting board. I still have with me 
the dust and discomfort of an overcrowded Rock Island train, and am a 
living evidence of the inefficiency of the commissary department of Cuba. 
(Laughter.)</p> 

<p>It was my good fortune, as a newspaper man, to be with the Fifth 
Army Corps, under William R. Shatter, almost from the beginning of hostilities until within a few days of their suspension.</p> 

<p>It is difficult, at this time, to recount the results of the war. The war 
began and ended unexpectedly, and events followed one another with such 
rapidity and so much history was crowded into such a short space of time 
that it is, as I say, at this time, difficult to estimate the results of the war.</p> 

<p>We are today a greater citizenship than on the first of May when George 
Dewey sailed up Manila bay and introduced Uncle Sam to the leading 
powers of the world, as a cosmopolitan, world-wide citizen, a cross between 
Buff-ilo Bill and Simon LeGris, to be taken into the reckoning hereafter if 
trouble is to be avoided. (Applause and laughter.)</p> 

<p>It is much easier to enthuse over the liberation of an oppressed and 
down-trodden people around the banquet board than it is on the deck of an 
overcrowded transport troop ship, or amidst the hardships of camp life</p> 

<p>I accompanied Shaffer's army from Tampa to Cuba, and it was an interesting experience and one not to be forgotten. The spectacle of twenty 
thousand men being landed on a hostile shore, with bayonets and bullets—
not a committee of reception and badges—to receive them, was an interesting and inspiring sight.</p> 

<p>Leaving Tampa, we sailed down through the various bodies of water, 
down the Florida coast, out to Dry Tortugas, then the full length of the island and around the bend of the eastward point, then eastwardly 75 miles, 
until you come within sight of Morro Castle at the entrance to the harbor 
of Santiago de Cuba; laying there on the troop ship at night, wrapped 
in a blanket, and tossed by the sea, gazing up at the blue firmament above, 
the tropical conditions disclose many stars never seen in our northern latitudes.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.115.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.115.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.115.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span> 

<p>To while away the long hot nights we would look out upon the water, 
in the darkness and blackness of the night; the only lights were the single lights of these 39 wooden vessels, as helpless in the presence of modern 
guns as Paul Jones' fleet if we had it today. Stern wheelers, side wheelers, 
ocean propellers, screw propellers, ships of every variety of form and every 
conceivable shape that Uncle Sam was able to get together in a hurry, 
and looking out on that procession, with eleven fighting ships at the side, 
and the great battle ship Indiana in front, with its upper rigging and turrets towering above the water like towers of an old mediaeval castle, it 
was an impressive scene. Looking out at the little solitary lights in each 
of these ships, in their silent procession, in the darkness of the night, you 
might imagine they were the lights along the principal streets of a country 
town. Here was the corner drug store, there the postofflce, over yonder 
the corner grocery, with its cracker boxes and tallow barrels and free American citizens discussing the silver problem; over on the right you might 
imagine that small lonely light was the school house light and you were 
hurrying across the prairie to fill a night appointment, and were somewhat 
late; and this other light was at the farm house of the leading citizen, the 
man who looked after the delegations, and you would expect the dog to 
come out barking to receive you.</p> 

<p>These thoughts might pass through the mind while sailing down in the 
darkness of the night through these various bodies of water, when the 
lights were out and the newspaper men could not play poker to kill time: 
when our thirty-five newspaper intellects would be at parade rest for want 
of something entertaining, and we had to think, and thinking is a last resort.</p> 

<p>Then, when you arrived, after these days and nights of trials and tribulations, and after the morning round ups when they would bring the sick 
men on the ships, with the newspaper representatives, and the foreign 
army and navy representatives of the world, bring the boys to spread the 
various diseases throughout the various other parts of the ship, day after 
day, bringing them on a little more thickly, until all the state rooms were 
crowded and you did not know whether you were going to have typhoid fever the measles or what, and finally, after that had gone on six days and 
nights and the water was gone out of the tanks, and the ginger ale from 
the bar, and the boys were out of cigars and cigarettes, and swapping tobacco and chewing brown paper and other make-shifts to supply the tobacco 
that was gone, and you arrive and see Morro Castle, and the ships, and 
Sampson and Schley, and everybody else, and the ambitious young lieutenants of the navy who were eager to emulate Dewey</p> 

<p>Then to follow the fleet around the corner where you bombard Daquiri with eleven fighting ships, throwing all sizes and shapes of shot and 
shell on shore, and then landing and sleeping on shore for the first night, 
in the midst of a great army, and hear the outposts all up through the 
glens of the little mountains, saying halt, who goes there, and the neighing 
of the artillery horses all around you, and you begin to wonder if God Almighty is going to smile on an enterprise of the kind, when you are taking possession of land that belongs to somebody else for four hundred 
years, and to seek your berth and your bed, and other creeping things seek 
your berth and your bed, without any particular introduction, introduce 
you to the ways of the tropics, and you hear the bands play, after a while, 
the old "Star Spangled Banner," the first time, possibly, in that country, 
and "America," and then, the only survivor of the civil war, that seems to 
suit both sides, "Dixie," and invariably wind up with the new battle hymn 
of the republic, "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight." I will 
never forget that night. I was thinking, as I said, it is a last resort, I 
wondered if God Almighty had any partnership in that enterprise, or 
whether it was going to be well with us, and that is a rather singular thing 
to be passing through the mind of a newspaper man, and only passes 
through in extreme cases.</p> 

<p>Finally, the Ninth Infantry Band, not far away, every man as black as 
night, and each man a giant, wound up the concert with "Nearer My God 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.116.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.116.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.116.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

to Thee." Then an unrepentant newspaper man did think of the circumstances that surrounded him, and then the rain began to pour, and it 
found all the American citizens that were there. It found fifty hostlers in 
charge of the artillery back of our camp, and they had been told that if 
you got wet and cold at night that you must keep moving, so they built an 
enormous bonfire when the rain began and formed in procession around 
that bonfire and tramped a^?ound it throughout the entire night, singing 
everything from gospel hymns down, and invariably wound up with a "Hot 
Time," and they kept that up until the first rays of dawn, and we were 
engaged in raising the flag of liberty in Cuba. (Applause.) And then the 
boys would gather around the campfires at night with their gums bleeding and their mouths dry and lips blistered, and the blood fevered in the 
veins, and you have got to pass through the fever before you are fit to live 
in that country and get the northern instincts out of you, before you are 
prepared to do business, sit around the campfire instead and talk of the 
good things to be had up in God's country. I remember an Irishman in our 
camp. "Young," he says, "when you go back to America, you are going 
back sooner than we are, because we are working by the day and we have 
to stay, go into the first saloon that you come to tljat looks respectable, 
get a "tin bucket full of beer and a chunk of ice in it the size of your head 
and a low stool, spread yourself out, and bury your face in the beer and 
think of me." (Laughter.) He says: "Don't take your face away or wipe 
off your chin, it would be greater than the crime of seventy-three."</p> 

<p>You can judge by my emaciated appearance whether I followed directions or not.</p> 

<p>There were many instances, and I tell you if the American republic endures a thousand years, they will never realize the singleness of purpose 
and the heroism of the soldiers of the United States army, after they have 
been waiting for thirty .years to put into practice what for thirty years 
they had been learning. (Applause.) Every man came off those vessels 
with a Krag-Jorgensen by his side and his blanket rolled over his shoulders, three days rations and one hundred cartridges in his belt, with as 
fixed a determination to start toward the proposed firing line of 
Santiago as if he already had had orders and his position been designated. 
There will never be greater deeds of heroism and there never has been by 
American soldiers since Washington's men left the bloody imprints of their 
feet in the snows of Valley Forge. (Applause.) The first battles of the republic fought by the regular soldiers cf the United States army since Scott 
and Taylor captured the City of Mexico, more than fifty years before, and 
one-fourth of all that number were black men and all under the command of 
General Joseph Wheeler of the South.</p> 

<p>Indeed we might say when we see these Southern men saying forward 
to the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry and the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth 
Infantry, "now let the thy servant depart in peace as in the fulfillment of 
the law." If there is a preacher here I would thank him to correct my 
scripture.</p> 

<p>There is much to be said about this great campaign in Cuba, and this first 
ought to be said, that that battle could not have been better fought by living 
men than it was fought under the command of Shafter. (Applause.) The 
greatest criticism that could be said would be that a man, that no man 
weighing three hundred and twenty-fivb pounds had any business in that 
climate under any circumstances, and the only marvel is that he lived; with 
fever, with rheumatism, with every known ailment, that man directed the 
fight,' but the God's truth is it did not need anybody to direct it. There 
was Chaffee and Hawkins and Kent and Betts and Sumner, and Capron's 
battery and Grimes' battery, and the coolness and the determination of the 
men, and they would have taken Santiago or died in the attempt, but if 
Shafter and every other commander there had been in the bottom of the 
Caribbean sea it would have been fought just the same, because of the indomitable heroism of the men.</p> 

<p>War was a new enterprise with me, and I remember the first news of 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.117.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.117.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.117.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the battle. Myself and an old friend, who accompanied me on the way 
down and who had been all through the civil war and had been in the 
army forty years and was then on the retired list, were sitting in a va 
cant bungalow not far from Daquiri, where we landed, for the name is Daquiri and not Baquiri, as Uncle Sam's maps have it; it is owned by the 
Spanish-American Iron Company, and the name is Daquiri. We were there 
when Cal Brice and a captain whose name I have forgotten, came riding 
out with horses covered with foam and perspiration and all having the appearance of excitement, and we went out, and they told us that harrowing 
tale of the fight back in the woods where the Spanish had been driven 
away from our landing place and had attacked Roosevelt's Rough Riders 
and the First cavalry and others under the command of Colonel Wood in 
one column and General Wheeler in the other, and had surprised them 
and they had literally slaughtered the entire command, or the heads of 
their columns. Although depressed with heat, we started pell mell for that 
battlefield as you would go to a fire in Omaha, out of curiosity; we forgot 
being tired, and we got up there and found the place strewn with dead and 
Avounded men. Myself and others propped Marshall of the New York Journal up, had a bullet through him, while he dictated a last letter to his wife 
and made his will. We assisted the wounded down to Sibonev and the 
next morning we gathered there and buried the dead. Sixteen Americans 
were laid in that grave, one grave, on which we laid this tall guana grass 
to make it soft and gentler for the boys in their last sleep, rolling them 
first m their blankets and then we covered them over with guana gra=s 
and then with a foot of black loam, the richest soil in the world to protect them from the ever present buzzard, and then Chaplain Vanderwater 
of the Seventy-first New York took his place at the head of the grave and 
read a chapter from the New Testament, and the newspaper men and soldiers gathered there started "Nearer My God to Thee," while we stood 
with bared heads in the tropical sun. It was the first tragic touch of war 
and It was new to most of us, we knew nothing about it, and during these 
solemn proceedings I wondered if it was right to invade an alien shore 
even in the name of better things and better promises and better hopes' 
I need not go further. I believe the war has been worth all it cost. It has 
placed the old flag on every court house of the South; it has placed a little flag on the lappels of all the summer girls and the matrons of the 
South, and for the first time since I860 it has placed the old star spangled 
banner on the capitol at Richmond. It has bridged the bloody chasm that 
stood open for thirty-five years. It has sent the sons of Lee and Grant 
into the same conflict and on the same side. It has made' us a united republic, and if we go and extend the helping hand of friendship and morality and education and religion to the black people of Cuba and Porto Rico 
and the Philippines and bring them up to a higher standard of civilization 
is it not possible that we are doing more for these people than we are for 
ourselves?</p> 

<p>And where we are standing around our own street corners quarre'ing 
as to whether we are to have dollars of a certain weight or a certain other 
weight. Is it not better then and is it not just at the time when America's hands were empty and we had conquered our own wildernesses, and 
bridged our own streams and tunnelled our own mountains, and there was 
no further progress in our own land unless we countermarched and looked 
by the right and by the left to see if we had omitted anything in our former 
march. (Applause.) Has it not come about in God's Providence that these 
new fields for the resistless, immeasurably restless energy of the American 
people to reach out in other lands and do other things for humanity. And 
what are we here for? When we are uplifting other men are we not at 
the same time uplifting ourselves. God is smiling on" this great conquest, 
and has smiled on it from Dewey's first shot until the last, in front of Santiago and back of it. Never such a war fought at so little cost; never an 
accident happened that has not been on our side. Every unexpected thing 
has been in favor of Uncle Sam. The?e things do not happen by accident. 
They are intentional. It is the purpose of the pbwer that rules all things 
to give this great people these new o pportunities in these different parts 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.118.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.118.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.118.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

of the world. And if I should live a thousand years I will never forget 
when we laid off the harbor of Daquiri after the bombai'dment at a quarter after five on the 21st day of June, after the landing had begun and 
seventeen thousand had been put on shore, we noticed on the precipitous 
mountain in full view of all, three American soldiers climbing up there 
through that dense menagua, to place the old flag on that height, and in 
less than ten minutes the old Star Spangled Banner was waving from the 
flagstaff that had been erected by Spain; then all the ships that had guns 
fired, and all the young soldiers that had not landed were up in the rigging, 
and wherever they could get a foothold and hanging by spars and ropes, 
and the cheering was taken up from ship to ship, and then the bands took 
a turn, and the old "Star Spangled Banner" and "America" and "Dixie" 
struck up, and the enthusiasm reached ninety degrees in the shade, and 
the blood coursed through the veins with irresistible energy, when all of the 
bands by common consent played "There Will Be a Hot Time in the Old 
Town Tonight." (Applause.)</p> 

<p>This great enterprise is but characteristic of the American people, and 
also emphasizes the fact that the American hands are nearly out of something to do, otherwise we would not devote ourselves to bickerings and 
quarreling about this thing and that, and these other enterprises come in in 
time to meet this universal demand, and it has been a wonderful war, for 
a great purpose. It has accomplished great things, and it has caused 
great sufferings, as all wars must do, but it has placed Uncle Sam and 
John Bull arm in arm, and the two great English speaking nations are 
one in heart and sentiment, and when they start out on a great enterprise 
there is scarcely any other great combination that dare tread upon the 
tails of their coats.</p> 

<p>Uncle Sam and John Bull, two great civilizers of the world to be, the 
great promoters of commerce, and as a consequence all other good things 
that follow along with it. Long may they reign, and long may our mutual 
enterprises progress. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>The Chairman—This is the last time I shall call upon the quartet. I 
hope they will indulge us once more. If they happen to have a patriotic 
air in the number, that they can give us, we will be obliged.</p> 

<p>The quartet sang "Oh, Say, Can You See by the Dawn's Early Light."</p> 

<p>The Chairman—Gentlemen, with one more toast we will bring the exercises to a close. Before doing that I want to return the thanks of the 
Iowa Commission to President Wattles and to each member of the Board 
of Directory for the very fine way in which you have handled all the difficult things that we have brought before you, without any complaint, and 
with uniform good feeling. You have made us feel at all times perfectly 
at home in this enterprise. To the other gentlemen that have come here tonight, and especially to those that have favored us with most interesting remarks, the Commission also desires to return their warmest thanks; and to 
those other gentlemen here who could have responded most gracefully 
and earnestly and patriotically, had we only a little more time to have 
given them also, we return the thanks of our Commission. I will give you 
now, in closing, this wi'l be the last, a toast to those that are not here, "The 
Blessed Ones, the Ladies," and will call on Congressman Mercer to respond.</p> 

<p>CONGRESSMAN DAVID H. MERCER.</p> 

<p>Mr Toastmaster and Gent'emen—A few years ago I stood on Tenth 
street, in this city, it was a summer evening, the merchants were standing 
out in front looking for a'r and looking for trade. A man, minus a leg, 
came hobbling up Tenth street. He was on crutches; he came to a clothing store, and he says: "Have you any one legged pants." And the man 
says: "No, sir; we do not keep anything of the sort in our store." The man 
next door, who was also in the clothing business, heard the inquiry, rushed to the rear end of his store, took down a pair of pantaloons, which he 
thought would fit the man on crutches. He took back a pair of shears and 
cut off one leg from the pantaloones. Ihen he put them back on the counter 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.119.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.119.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.119.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

and he rushed to the front door. The cripple by that time had got in 
front of his place, and he says: "How do you do, sir; have you any one 
leg-ged pants?" "Yes," he said; I always keep in stock everything- my customers ask for." The one legged man went into the store, went back to 
the rear end, and the merchant, in all confidence, took down the pair of 
pantaloons and shook them out and immediately saw that he had cut off 
the wrong leg. Now, I think Governor Packard, in assigning me to this 
loast has cut off the wrong leg. There was a time in my experience when, 
so far as ladies are concerned, I dealt in the plural, but I am married 
now, and j'ou know what that mears.</p> 

<p>After listening to the remarkable address by our friend and everybody's friend, Mr. Lafe Young of Iowa, we are more thankful than ever 
that we have ladies on earth, because were it not for a lady, he would 
not have been here, and he could not have given us that remarkable address. Were it not for the ladies none of us would be here and have the 
pleasure of being the guests of such hospitable men as those who come 
from Iowa to visit us in Nebraska. Were it not for the ladies we would not 
have had the p'.easure of listening to all the remarkable speeches made here 
this evening, or listening to the splendid music or partaken of this excellent food.</p> 

<p>And your toastmaster would have shown wisdom in the assignment of 
this toast if he had called upon Mr. Rosewater of the Bee, or Mr. Dawson 
of the Des Moines Leader, or my friend Judge Wright of Council Bluffs, 
for they are all ladies' men; they could give you pointers that I know little about in reference to the ladies. Even my friend Senator Allen might 
have discoursed a little bit when he took the floor and talked to you and devoted part of his time to the subject of ladies, because he and my friend 
Thurston this afternoon were enjoying the inidway, and had it not been for 
the ladies they could not have had any fun in the streets of Cairo and the 
Streets of all Nations.</p> 

<p>I remember, some years ago, in Massachusetts, a lady sitting in a coach 
Across the way a gentleman who kept looking at that lady time and time 
again, and, finally, he got up and went over to her and says: "I beg your 
pardon, madam, but I think I know you: your name, please." She says: 
"Lydia Pinkham is my name." He had seen the cut in the newspapers so 
often that he thought he knew the lady.</p> 

<p>Two ladies sitting in a Pullman car. One complained that the car was 
close; the other lady complained there was too much draft in the Pullman. 
Finally, the lady who did not have air, not finding the porter, pushed up 
the inside window, and she sat back and breathed the air. The lady, 
across from her, who complained there Avas a draft, said: "I wish you 
would put that window down, because I am catching cold from the draft." 
And the altercation grew and attracted the attention of the conductor who 
came to see what the difficulty was. And the lady looking for air said: "I 
opened the window to get air because it is too close in here." And the lady 
across from her says: "I wish she would put it down; I am catching 
cold." The conductor says: "Those are double windows in this car, and 
neither one is relieved and neither ore has any complaint." If it were not 
for the ladies we would not have such pleasantries as this upon the railroads of this country.</p> 

<p>Mr. Toastmaster, if it were not for the ladies some of us would stay 
out a good deal later than we do. If it were not for the ladies civilization 
would be a good deal worse off than it is today, and in nine cases out of 
ten if mankind will confine itself to the sociable and its associations to 
places where ladies are the world will be all the better for it.</p> 

<p>It is a pleasant entertainment to meet around a banquet board like this, 
and it is fitting upon occasions of th"s kind that we should remember that 
we have intimate friends, that we have our wives and our sisters, and our 
daughters at home, and they are entitled to our thoughts, even in the 
highest moments of our hilarity. They are the corner stones of our up

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.120.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.120.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.120.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

building. To them are we anchored and in many cases whenever we meet 
with success in this life we can ascribe most of that success to the influence of ladies.</p> 

<p>Mr. Toastmaster, it was before the prohibition scare when I came to 
Nebraska. My father and mother stopped in Benton County, Iowa, long 
enough to let me see the first light of day, and it is not strange, Governor Saunders, that I have affection and friendship for the State of Iowa, 
and we in Nebraska admire that magnificent State, the great State University, her other great educational institutions, her remarkable newspapers, her big broad manhood, her statesmen and her splendid citizenship.</p> 

<p>And this Exposition, Mr. Toastmaster, is indebted to Iowa as much as 
to any other State, because Senator Allison and Senator Gear helped us in 
the Senate every day and hour when the bill was before Congress, and Congressman Dolliver, upon the Ways and Means Committee, never let an opportunity pass by but what he would give us his assistance and his counsel. This is our neighboring State, and I say, Mr. Toastmaster, it is well 
for us to be friendly in the years to come. When the people of Omaha 
started this Exposition Council Bluffs joined hands, and we had no more 
loyal friend, Mr. Wattles, than Council Bluffs in all the struggles, and the 
ladies of Council Bluffs joined with the ladies of Omaha to make this Exposition the great and grand success that it is. (Applause.)</p> 

<p>Mr. Toastmaster, it is late; we have had a splendid time, and I think 
any one who would attempt to command too much of your attention after listening to the splendid speeches we have had thus far this evening 
would be committing a crime. And I thank you very much, I assure you. 
(Applause.)</p> 

<p>On the morning of the 21st, a number of bands arrived, concerts were 
given at the Iowa Building during the entire day and evening.</p> 

<p>A procession was formed in the city, composed of Governor Leslie M. 
Shaw, mounted, attended by Adj. Gen. Melville H. Byers and members 
of the Governor's staff, and State Oflficers. Governor Holcomb of Nebraska 
and staff, President Wattles and members of the Executive Committee of 
the Board of Management of the Exposition, the orator of the day, Hon. 
Robert G. Cousins, Congressman Fifth Congressional District, of Iowa, 
and others that were to participate in the program, with numerous Iowa 
Bands of Music, followed by a large delegation from Council Bluffs, including companies of cadets. This splendid representation was escorted 
by the Iowa Agricultural College Cadets, Commanded by Col. Herman 
Knapp with Agricultural College Band acting as escort to the Governor.</p> 

<p>They proceeded to the main entrance of the Exposition Ground on the 
east side of Sherman Avenue, where they were met by Major Clarkson, 
General Manager of the Exposition, and were conducted by him to the 
Iowa State Building, thence through the Exposition Grounds to the Auditorium, where thousands of Iowa citizens had assembled awaiting the arrival of the distinguished party who were to take part in the program.</p> 

<p>Vice President Allan Dawson of the Iowa Commission, acted as Chairman, introduced the speakers and the following program was given: </p>

<p>ADDRESS, GOVERNOR LESLIE M. SHAW.</p> 

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens and Friends of Iowa:</p> 

<p>"Not many generations ago, in the place where you now sit, encircled 
by all that exalts and embellishes civilized life, the rank thistle nodded in 
the breeze, and the wild fox digged his hole unscared." So said Charles 
Sprague three-quarters of a century ago, and the utterance is as true when 
applied to the land of the Omahas as to the land of the Wampanoags.</p> 

<p>We meet this day as citizens of Iowa, on the soil of a sister State, for 
no idle purpose. The people of Iowa are not idlers, but the day will 
have been lost to us and to our children unless what is here said, and 
done, and witnessed, and enjoyed shall bring greater thoughtfulness and 
increased earnestness. The half century and two years since the admission of Iowa added the twenty-ninth star to the flag which has now become the protector of the world have wrought great changes. Most of 
the improvements of earth, most of the progress in the arts and sciences, 
most of the advance in civilization, have been wrought within the period of 
our State history. Time would not permit, if the inclination were present, 
to recount the achievements in the political, industrial, financial, agricultural, mechanical, scientific, educational, religious or moral world. Suffice 
it to say that in all of these Iowa has rendered her full share of service, and 
has reaped her full measure of blessing. We can well afford to leave to 
others the study of the past. Let it be ours manfully to face the future, 
now more than ever big with possibilities, and . with careful glance ahead 
improve the present.</p> 

<p>In all the grand exhibit of this remarkable Exposition there is not found 
that for which our State has greatest reason to rejoice. The product of the 
farm, of the orchard, of the garden, of the herd, of the dairy, of the factory, 
of the mine are here in great quantity and of superb quality. Truly Iowa is 
great in territory, great in resources, great in product, but she is greatest 
of all in her children. There is presented to my eye from th&gt;3 platform 
that which is infinitely more valuable than all herds and all harvests. 
I see scattered through this audience many of the youth of Iowa. They 
are from the city, from the town, from the hamlet, and from the Iowa 
farm. They are representatives of an aggregate of seven hundred thousand of school age, and of an equal number who have just passed from 
educational tuition to face the activities, the anxieties, and the achievements of manhood and womanhood. These all belong to a generation 
which will surely be heard from. Their fathers and mothers have been 
industrious, have been ambitious, have been hopeful, and have been successful. A generation thus circumstanced is always potential. Dr. Strong 
tells of a township in the western reserve which was settled with an 
energetic, liberty-loving, God-fearing, educationally-inclined people, and 
which in a limited period'furnlshed many members of the State Legislature. 
From that community of only a few hundred inhabitants men went forth to 
college professorships east and west, to the supreme bench of the State, 
and to the United States Congress. Northampton, Mass., has among its 
native and resident population over four hundred graduates from colleges 
and other educational institutions; it has furnished the world with one 
hundred and fourteen ministers, eighty-four ministers' wives, ten missionaries, twenty-five judges, one hundred and two lawyers, ninety-five physicians, seven college presidents, thirty professors, sixty-four other educa

tors, twenty-four editors, six historians, twenty-four authors, two governors, and thirty other State officers, twenty-five members of the State 
General Court, as the Legislature is styled, two generals, six colonels, 
thirteen other army officers, thirty-eight officers of the United States, 
among them a Secretary of the Navy, two Foreign Ministers, a Treasurer 
of the United States, five Senators of the United States, eight Members of 
Congress and one President. If a territory six miles square, under favorable conditions can make such a record, what may we not hopefully expect from a territory containing fifty-five thousand square miles, all of it 
similarly peopled, and with conditions more favorable than Massachusetts 
ever enjoyed or Ohio ever possessed.</p> 

<p>"Know thyself," said the Greek philosopher. "Know thine opportunity" 
has become a companion and equally important maxim.</p> 

<p>When you go home tonight tell the children that the world is big and 
constantly expanding; that this day's experience has broadened your 
vision; that life has become more real and hope more ardent; and that 
both j'ou and the world, and especially the States expect something of 
them. Wake the boy in the night, break in upon his dreams with stories 
of hopeful possibilities; watch the fire kindle in his eye; then let him 
dream again of greater things, of broader expanses, of higher altitudes, of 
nobler achievements. Neglect neither seed time nor harvest; watch the 
growing and maturing crops; succor and protect both flocks and herds; 
zealously guard the interests of the shop and the store and the ofl^ce; but, 
above all, look well to the youth of Iowa, and to all things that shall conserve the generation whose footsteps crowd the threshold of the world's activities.</p> 

<p>PRESIDENT WATTLES' WELCOME.</p> 

<p>In the welcome he extended on behalf of the Exposition Management 
President Wattles declared that Iowa is the finest agricultural State in 
the Union. It has a smaller percentage of untillable land than any 
other territory in the world. It has a smaller percentage of illiteracy 
and fewer criminals. This condition he charged to the fact that farming was the principal vocation of the State's people. Agriculture breeds 
virtue and contentment and this influence is apparent in the Hawkeye 
State. There are no large cities to draw the people into faster living 
and to inspire them with the greed for gain.</p> 

<p>There was a special reason, President Wattles said, why this occasion 
had more of pleasure for him than other events of like character, for he 
was extending a greeting to his old associates and neighbors. It was with 
pride that he referred to a residence in Iowa covering a period of his early 
manhood, and it was at that time that he came to know and love the people of Iowa. The population of the State was of a singularly sturdy, progressive and intelligent character and in respect to these qualities unsurpassed by the people of any other commonwealth.</p> 

<p>The chapters that Iowa has added to the growth and development of the 
west were among the most important and instructive in the annals of 
the whole Trans-Mississippi region. He cheerfully gave to Iowa the credit 
of being the first State to pass an appropriation for the Exposition and on 
behalf of the management he bore testimony to the support w^hich the 
State had from the first and constantly given to the great enterprise. He 
reminded the people of the State of the intelligent and effective administration of the Commission, and mentioned the handsome State Building 
and the splendid exhibits as affording ocular proof that this commendation was well deserved.</p> 

<p>Continuing the speaker dwelt on the hardships and difficulties that 
were encountered in the pioneer life of the State. Their struggles with 
these conditions left the people inured to hardship and able to fully ap-

 the luxuries and conveniences that came with civilization. How 
gladly the settlers who hauled their wheat 200 miles to market and then 
«old it for 40 cent-5 a bushel welcomed the scream of the engine and the 
approach of the railroads. It is no wonder, he declared, that the people 
of such a State should be intelligent, prosperous and happy.</p> 

<p>In conclusion he assured the visitors that they are equal partners in 
the enterprise and cordially urged them to make themselves at home m 
the magnificent White City that they had helped to build.</p> 

<p>ADDRESS BY ROBERT G. COUSINS, M. C, AT OMAHA.</p> 

<p>Delivered at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, 

Sept. 21.</p>

<p>IOWA DAY, 1898.</p> 

<p>The State of Iowa accepts with fraternal gladness the hospitable hand 
of greeting extended by Nebraska and our other sister States m this 
great empire of the pioneers and salutes with reverent patriotism the federal government of the United States.</p> 

<p>In the words of that original and poetic genius, "Ironquill," who has 
voiced so well the thought and feelings of our westland, and who has made 
the name of Kansas known forever in the world of letters:</p> 

<span class="lg poem"><span class="l">States are not great </span>
<span class="l">Except as men may make them.</span> 
<span class="l">Men are not great except they do and dare.</span> 
<div class="milestone section"> </div>
<span class="l">All mredit comes from braving the unequal.</span>
<span class="l">All glory comes from daring to begin.</span></span>

<p>I have asked five of the ablest and most noted Americans what they 
regard as the chief thing or leading feature of the Trans-Mississippi region and they have invariably answered, "Its men and women." The other day I met one of the oldest settlers of eastern Iowa—one of those original, 
rugged characters whose wit and wisdom has lightened the settlers' hearts 
and homes for many a toilsome year—one of those interesting characters 
who never bores you and whom one always likes to meet—a man whose 
head is silvered and whose countenance is kind—and I asked him what he 
regarded as the principal feature of our Trans-Mississippi country, and he 
replied: "Well, I'm no scholar, but I've been round here nigh onto sixty 
years and I reckon 'bout the most important thing is the folks and the 
farms."</p> 

<p>While you rest here a little while in this splendid auditorium before 
going to view the wonders and the beauties of the Exposition (and incidentally the Midway) I shall speak briefly of the folks and farms of my native State of Iowa and of this empire of the pioneers. In doing so, 
I have some hesitation, realizing as I do that there are doubtless those in 
this vast audience who were contemporaries with my grandfathers in the 
early settlement of Iowa away back In the thirties, and who are far better 
qualified to tell the tale of toil and triumph which is the glory and the 
honor of our birthland. In such a discussion, I feel as though I was 
standing on the bank of a magnificent stream in the hearing of patriarchs 
and pilgrims who have traveled from its source. I can look at its swift 
flowing current and think of the scenes by which it has swept in its lonely way from the wilds where it started; I can remember with you the roaming red man who watched with jealous eye the coming of this Anglo-Saxon stream of civilization; I can marvel with you at the vastness of the products of its soil, watered with the tears of happiness and toil; 
I can realize with you the ruggedness and patience of its manhood and 
the strength and gentleness of its womanhood, but of its landscape 
farther up, its tributaries and its cabins, its haunts and huts and won

ders, its picturesqueness of primeval life, the story is far better told by 
him whose tired feet have trudged along the way, whose hands have 
toiled and whose hair has turned to gray.</p> 

<p>Iowa became a separate territory, with the capital at Burlington, ia 
1838, and was admitted into the Union "in 1846, and has been in it ever 
since. It makes little difference whether it was first settled by the 
whites at Dubuque for mining purposes in 1788, or, for trading purposes, 
at Montrose, in 1799, or opposite Prairie du Chien, in 1804 or 5, or in Lee 
county at Sandusky in 1820, or on the lower rapids at what is now known, 
as Nashville, in 1829; or whether the first settlements for general purposes 
were made at Burlington and Davenport in 1832. The main facts is that 
it was well settled—not by dyspeptic tourists nor by invalids who had 
come west out of curiosity and New Jersey, nor by climate seeking dilettanti with two servants and one lung—but by the best bone and sinew 
of the Middle States, New England and the Old World. I do not know 
that there were any dukes or lords or marquises or duchesses, but there 
were Dutch and Irish and Scotch and Scotch-Irish and English and Americans and they had home rule right from the start—at least they had in 
the first school which I attended. The men and women who settled the 
Hawkeye State were not those who expected to go back "in the fall," or as 
soon as they could prove up on their claims. They were stayers. They 
were not men to be discouraged by winter or by work. They were men 
who knew that nobody ever amounted to much in this world unless he had 
to. Most of them began simply with the capital of honesty, good health 
and their inherent qualities of character. They built their cabins in the 
clearings and watching the smoke cuil up in the great wide sky, felt just 
as patriotic for their humble rustic homes as e'er did princes for their castles or millionaires for mansions grand.</p>

<p>To build a home is a great thing. It doesn't matter so much about the 
dimensions. "Kings have lived in cottages and pygmies dwelt in palaces," 
but the walls of a home always add something to inherent character. In 
the formation of character there are always two elements, the inherent and 
the adventitious—that which we bring with us into the world and that which 
our surroundings give us. Somebody said "There is only a small portion; 
of the earth that produces splendid people." Our pioneers got into a good 
place. They had left doubt sitting on a boulder in the east and packed 
their things and started for the west. Rivers had to be forded, trees to be 
felled: cabins had to be built—the rifle must be kept loaded—so much the 
better, there was self-reliance. Corn and coffee had to be ground, and' 
on the same mill—so much the better, there was ingenuity. Teeth had 
to be filled, and there was no painless dentistry. Disease and injury 
must be dealt with, and the doctor fifty miles away. Life must be 
lightened, lonely hearts must be cheered, and the old friends and comrades far back in the States or may b? away in the Fatherland, and the 
cheering letter tarrying with the belated stage coach—hold fast, thou 
sturdy denizen and gentle helpmate of the rich and wondrous empire, infinite goodness guards thee and the fertile fields are ready to reward!</p> 

<p>Ah, pampered people of the later generations, when you imagine modern hardships, think of the courage and the trials and the ingenuity of 
pioneers when there were no conveniences but the forest and the axe. the 
wide rolling prairie and the ox team, the great blue sky, the unsolved future and the annual ague! Complain of markets in these modern times 
and then think of your grandmother when she was a blooming bride, listening through the toilsome days and anxious nights for the wagon 
bringing home the husband from a distant market with calico and jeans 
purchased with dressed pork sold a dollar and a half a hundred, and' 
maybe bringing home a little money, worth far less per yard than either 
calico or jeans. Maybe it was all for the best, human character was 
being formed for the development of a great and loyal and progressive State 
to shine forever among the stars of the Federal Union.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.125.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.125.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.125.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span> 

<p>Probably the purest time in the history of grovernineuLs and of men is 
"When they are painfully intent upon the labor of their development and 
defense. Most all greatness and nearly every original idea has come out 
of some kind of trouble. Whoever gets to greatness or success without 
meeting opposition, goes in an air castle. Most of the flowers of genius 
have bloomed from bleeding hearts. There never was a strong and 
handsome face without some little line of care. And so every circumstance of those early, toilsome lives, every tedious trail, every tear, every 
home whose roof kept out the storm and whose walls contained their sorrows and their joys; all the gifts of a generous soil in return for careful 
cultivation; every irritating inconvenience which finally drove some questioned mind to ponder out improvements, all such experiences are as certain in their formation and development of character and mind as are 
inherent qualities that accompany the origin and mystery of life.</p> 

<p>Somewhere I have seen an etching of a face that was called Experience, and I have never forgotten it—one never does forget a face that has 
ideas in it. This one was the illustrated history of a life. There was 
Youth with all its hope, marked here and there with all the lines of 
strife and care and victory which middle life had placed upon it. And 
there was the mystic touch of later years, like autumn's pencil work in 
nature, all shaded with the mellow haze of time—a kind of soft and silvery veil with which deft nature covers up her glory—a picture penciled 
by an artist with an tinderstanding mind, who knew his subject had 
thought as he had thought, felt as he had felt, dreamed as he had dreamed 
—a kind of picture that one sees so very very seldom, only as often as one 
finds genius—the divine—and I thought there is the typical picture of a 
pioneer and well named "Experience."</p> 

<p>Civil government in Iowa proceeded with its rapid settlement. The pioneer became a model citizen. He knew the necessity for the laws that were 
enacted. He did not feel oppressed by government. He had experienced 
the losses of robbery and larceny and knew something of the embarrassment and inconvenience of being scalped. There was no hysteria about 
trusts and combines because they had practiced combinations themselves for 
mutual protection. If any one would learn the true genius and exemplification and philosophy of self-government^ government of and for and by 
the people, let him study the records of pioneer life, the institutional beginnings and the evolution of their laws. It would be worth our while 
on some suitable occasion when time permitted to talk over the interesting incidents attending the administration of justice in the early days 
of Iowa, the incidents of its territorial legislatures, the birth and growth of 
its Statehood and the characters of its officials. But the greatness of our 
State is not contained in any name. Its official history is the exponent of its industrial life and character. Its greatness is the sum total 
of its citizenship. In order to be just, John Jones, the average citizen, 
must be mentioned along with our most illustrious officials. Somebody said 
that the history of a nation is the history of its great men, but there is 
an unwritten history which that averment overlooks. The growth of a 
State is the progress of its average citizen. The credit of a commonwealth is the thrift of its John Jones and William Smith, and the character, prosperity and patriotism of the individual citizen is the history of 
Iowa.</p> 

<p>The population of 97,000 which she had when admitted into the Union 
had increased to 754,699 at the close of the Civil war. Of these about 70,000. almost one-tenth of the population, were in the war—a number equal 
to nearly one-half the voters of the State. Who made the history of Iowa 
during that great struggle of our nation's life? John Jones, the average 
citizen, whether he carried a musket helping to put the scattered stars of 
State back into the constellation of the Union, or whether he toiled from 
early dawn to lingering twilight in the fields or in the shop. The best 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.126.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.126.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.126.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

civilization is tliat which maintains the highest standard of life for its 
average citizen.</p> 

<p>Since the civil war the State of Iowa has increased in population to almost 2,225,000 of people, and most of the time has had the least illiteracy of 
any State in the Union. Doubtless for that we are indebted to many of 
the older States, whose enterprising and courageous citizens constitute solarge a portion of our population. With but half a century of statehood 
and with an area of but 55,475 square miles, the State of Iowa produces the 
greatest quantity of cereals of any State in the Union. As long ago as the 
last federal census, taken in 1890, it produced more corn, more oats, more 
beef, more pork than any State in the Union. Not long since I was introduced to a gentleman from New York City. He said: "Oh, from Iowa—
ah—let me see, that's out—ah—you see, I'm not very well posted on the 
geography of the West." "Yes," I said, "it's out there just across the Mississippi river. You can leave New York about noon and get your supper 
in Iowa the next evening. It might te worth your while to look it up. It's 
the State which produces more of the things which people eat than any 
other State in the Union. It has more miles of railroad than your State 
of New York, more than Mexico, more than Brazil and more than all the 
New England States combined."</p> 

<p>The value of Iowa's agricultural products and live stock in round numbers for the year 1892 was $407,000,000, to say nothing of her other great and 
various industries and enterprises. She produced that year 160,000,000 lbs. 
of the best butter on earth of the value of $32,000,000. The Hawkeye butter ladle has achieved a cunning that challenges all Columbia. The Iowa 
cow has slowly and painfully yet gradually and grandly worked her way 
upward to a shining eminence in the eyes of the world. The State of Iowa 
has on her soil today, if nothing ill befalls it, ninety million dollars' worth 
of corn. The permanent value of land is estimated by its corn-producing 
qualities. Of all the products of the earth, corn is king and it reigns in 
Iowa.</p> 

<p>Industry and natui'e have made the State of Iowa a creditor. Her soil 
has always been solvent and her system of farming does not tend to pauperize it. She is a constant seller, and therefore wants the evidence of the 
transaction to be unimpeachable. She has more school teachers than any 
other State except the Empire State and only three and six-tenths per 
cent of her population are illiterate. The State of Iowa has yielded the 
grandest dividends on her educational investments. She has become illustrious on account of her enlightenment. She has progressed further from 
"primitive indifferent tissue" than the land even of Darwin himself, and in 
her escape from protoplasm and prejudice she is practically out of danger. 
Marked out in the beginning by the hand of God, bounded on the east and 
west by the two great rivers of the continent, purified and stimulated by 
the snows of winter, blessed with copious rainfall in the growing season, 
with generous soil and stately forests interspersed, no wonder that the 
dusky aborigines exclaimed when they crossed the Father of Waters, 
"loAva; this is the place!" Not only did the red man give our State its 
beautiful and poetic name, but Indian nomenclature runs like a I'omance 
throughout the counties and communities. What infinite meaning, what 
tokens of joy and sadness, of triumph and of tears, of valor and of vanqulshment, of life and love and song there may be in these wierd, strange 
words that name today so many of our towns and streams and counties: 
Allamakee, Chickasaw, Dakota City, Sioux, Pocahontas, Winneshiek, Keo

rich and wonderous heritage of Iowa nativity, may sing the song of our le-

gends
 and traditions, may voice in verse the wondrous story of his illustrious State. Maybe somewhere among the humble homes where blood and 
bone and brain grow pure and strong; where simple food with frugal ways 
feeds wondering minds and drives them craving into nature's secrets and 
her songs—somewhere along the settler's pathway or by the Indian trail 
where now the country churchyards grown with uncut grasses hide the 
forms of sturdy ancestors sleeping all in peaceful ignorance of wayward 
sons or wondrous progeny—somewhere where rising sun beholds the peasantry at early toil and leaves them in the mystic twilight ere their tasks are 
done, where odors of the corn and new-mown hay and vine-clay hedges 
by the shadowy roadside linger long into the night-time, as a sweet and sacred balm for tired hearts—somewhere sometime the song of Iowa shall rise 
and live, and it will not omit the thought of that gifted son who said: 
"Iowa, the affections of her people, like the rivers of her borders, flow to 
an inseparable union."</p> 

<p>And now, my fellow citizens, a word about our great Trans-Mississippi 
region, the empire of the pioneers and of our country and its future.</p> 

<p>We have on this side of the Mississippi river an area of 2,143,155 square 
miles of land, two and a ciuarter times the area east of the Mississippi. 
You could put England, Ireland, Scotland, the German Empire, France, 
Austria, Hungary, Italy, Spain and all of the United States east of the 
Mississippi into this Trans-Mississippi territory without touching California or Hawaii, and Admiral Dewey Avould still have the Pacific ocean and 
Manila, with rope enough to lasso and hang the last enemy of the United 
States and civilization.</p> 

<p>The population east of the Mississippi in 1890 was 45,979,754, having increased eighteen per cent in the ten preceding years. The population west 
of the Mississippi in 1890 was 16,642,496, an increase of ninety-three per cent 
in the preceding decade. The wealth per capita east of the Mississippi increased twenty-two and three-quarters per cent from 1880 to 1890 and increased sixty-nine and one-half per cent west of the Mississippi in the samedecade.</p> 

<p>The State of Minnesota alone produces nearly one-eighth of the flour of 
the United States and Texas furnishes one-fifth of the cotton. Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri produce nearly half of the entire corn product 
of the country, over one-fourth of the beef and more than one-third of the 
pork. No other territory in the world of eciual area produces so much 
of the substantial food of life.</p> 

<p>Being a perpetual creditor, on account of its vast productions, the?western region and all its States have a common interest in the largest 
possible employment of people in other avocations than producing food, because employment not only creates appetite, but likewise the financial ability to satisfy it. The western region and its many States also have a common interest in honesty. Having given their labor for a large increase in 
wealth per capita—the largest of any section of the country—they are naturally interested in maintaining it. No one has a greater interest in the vested value of a dollar than he who has exchanged his labor and his products 
for it, or who has a constant surplus to be sold and registered as accumulated wealth. You labor today and accumulate thereby. You may want 
to rest tomorrow. Your accumulation should be secure. You have been 
selling all these years. You may wish to buy or build tomorrow. The 
credit registered by your toil, frugality and prudence should be forever 
sacred. The West should look to the future and think not only of its gains 
in one decade, but of the balance that will be to its credit in a hundred 
years from now. Do not forget that the world must eat and that mankind 
is multiplying by the millions, and that the Creator is not making any 
more land on this planet. Hold fast to the heritage which God and the 
pioneers have left you and to the standard of integrity and value by which 
it was earned. Let the future buy from you according to that same standard by which you have bought and by which your toil is measured in the 
present.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.128.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.128.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.128.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p>No one can foretell a limit of the possibilities of this great, producing, 
half-developed region for the future, with the United States forging to the 
front in the commerce of the world, claiming its harbors and its coaling 
stations along the lines of trade in the uttermost parts of the earth and realizing more than ever before that it is a joint proprietor with the older nations of the earth in the great high seas. Doubtless some people are overreckless for expansion and some are so conservative that their intellectual 
estates seem almost in probate. Douglas Jerrold used to say, "There are 
some people so conservative that they can never appreciate the new moon 
out of regard for that venerable institution, the old one," and Wendell 
Phillips added, "Some people are afraid to sweep off the cobwebs for fear 
the roof will come down!" But there is one thing reasonably certain: 
America will have a place to land and coal her ships in every quarter of 
the globe. There has been the age of marble and the age of bronze; ours 
is the age of commerce and of iron. Commerce will not stop, it undermines the mountains, lays its cables underneath the billows of the sea and scorns the fury of its crests. Commerce is a greedy, moiling, tireless 
spider catching all the world in a web of iron, and it will weave its wires 
wherever there is life. It has found the orient and the Occident and will 
never rest until it ties its cables to the poles.</p> 

<p>America will build a greater navy and will build the Nicaragua canal 
and her merchant ships will take her commerce into all the harbors of the 
world and our battleships shall protect our commerce in its legitimate and 
rightful course. The American flag shall be visible and revered away from 
home as it is loved and venerated here, and under it a free people shall 
thrive and multiply in peace.</p> 

<p>If one were to write a prophetic history of the next century and insist 
upon it with any degree of obstinancy, he would doubtless be deemed insane. If Washington, when he retired from public life, had uttered onehalf the truth of events that have since transpired, even Americans 
would have said that the pressure of official responsibility had rendered the 
Father of his Country a victim of dementia, and the world would have 
doubtless pronounced him crazy. If some optimist of New England had 
said a hundred years ago, as has transpired and been declared since 
then, that in the nineteenth century science would pierce through mountains that ancient poetry could never scale, whisper across the ocean, tame 
the lightning, annihilate space, explode superstition, create light, bottle up 
sound, he might have been arrected for witchcraft. If at the time when 
a hundred and eighty crimes were punishable with death, some judge or 
jurist had recognized the sunrise of civilization and had declared that the 
time would soon come when the greatest nation of the earth would inflict 
the death penalty for only two offenses, he might have been deposed for 
his opinion. If any one were to remina you now of one-half the century 
that is gone and foretell one-half the century to come he would be regarded 
as a dangerous man and rickety, and it would be used against him in the 
next campaign, no matter on what ticket he should run. The fact is that not 
many realize the rate at which the world is traveling. Time is so noiseless 
that it awakens very few. The Rip Van Winkles are as numerous as the 
Smiths and Browns and Joneses. Wh'le we are yet shaking hands with the 
events of yesterday genius taps us on the shoulder and introduces a stranger 
and we exclaim, "What impostor is this?" An impossibility, an event of the 
future.</p> 

<p>What shall be the events of the coming century? Probably with whatever degree of certainty we are able to comprehend the past and to understand the present, with that degree can we foretell the future. Yesterday 
and today are the premises of a syllogism whose conclusion is tomorrow. 
I believe there is a good reason for everything that happens in the universe. 
The indications are that the great events of the near future shall be in the 
line of commerce, as I have already indicated, of jurisprudence, of social 
economy, of science and of art. The teidency of the times is to get rid of 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.129.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.129.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.gov.iowa.1899.129.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

long-established humbugs as soon as their copyrights expire. The wisdom of 
the past shall be retained, but the wings of progress shall not be burdened 
by its evils and stupidity. So long as toil shall bend the back of man his 
brain shall question science for its mysteries, and so long as mystery remains to form the boundary line of knowledge the scientists will strive and 
climb and climb and reach beyond those bounds. They will make the electric current turn the wheels of all the world.</p> 

<p>And in our coming century there will be tumults, strife and riot, but 
there shall be no ruin. America shall be ruled by law. She will not forget 
the lessons that her patriots have taught. She will abide by the pilgrim covenant—the legally expressed will of the majority.</p> 

<p>And in the future, striving and contending with all its ceaseless, tireless 
energies, in that stately and majestic march of time and toil there will be 
success and failure, thrift and slothfulness, charity and meanness, hope and 
doubt, happiness and misery. And soma time it will lift up its voice and 
America shall hear great music—such as she has never known before—and 
there shall be great artists. Some one has said that America is too busy 
to make verses, too serious to sing songs; that all her ideas are marshal'ed 
up in battle array to solve the vital questions of self-government and that 
all her jewels are wrought into diadems to crown the kings of commerce 
and the lords of science, whilst poetry is swept away by the tide of activity that swells through every artery and vein of Columbia's land. And all 
that has been very true. But it shall not always be so. We shall not always take our melodies from old operas nor our designs from ancient frescoes. We shall not always dig our architecture from the ruins of the past 
nor get our fiction from the brains of dead men. The same conditions that 
bred the genius of dead empires shall find the muses and the artists for 
Columbia and a greater glory shall await them, for they shall all be born in 
freedom.</p> 

<p>By and by some millionaire, tired of killing pigs and packing pork, will 
see something beautiful or maybe something sad, and he will endow an Institution where poverty can come and dream and mark its pain and 
thought upon the canvas and the marble. And then some other hoarder of the 
millions shall grow weary cornering kerosene and corn, and he will hear 
some voice or see some fair young face with just a little line of care upon its 
arched and thoughtful brow, and he will add his charity to the goodness and 
the greatness of America and he wil say to genius, "Come, these walls shall 
keep the winds from shriveling up your tender wings on which you now 
may rise and soar and out of all your misery that is past make harmonies that will soften all the sorrows of mankind, revive the melodies that 
have been dying through all the centuries of time with the pain of silence 
and out of the inspiration that may come to you write rhapsodies that will 
lift and glorify the thoughts and minds of men and find the very throne 
of God." Emerson declared a little while before he died: "We think our 
civilization near its meridian, but we are yet only at the cock crowing and 
the morning star." The future will verify Emerson. The greatest alliance 
ever projected in history will be the alliance of American efforts and American interests. Into the opening gateway of the twentieth century, hand-inhand, shall spring our king of commerce and the queen of industry, the 
Sphinx-eyed scientist and his bride of art, the sturdy son of agriculture 
and the dreaming child of song, and their thought and toil and song shall 
honor and inspire the human race and make our country great—essentially, 
exquisitely, magnificiently great.</p> 

<p>At the close of this program a very pleasant reception was given by 
a committee of Iowa ladies to Mrs. Governor Shaw, Mrs. President Wattles 
and Mrs. Clement Chase, President of the Ladies' Board of Management 
of the Exposition. This was followed by illumination at the Iowa Building 
and grand concert by the Mexican band on the Plaza.</p> 

<p>After the concert, there was a magnificent display of fireworks given by 
the Board of Management in honor of Iowa Day. The illuminated motto 
over the arch of the Central Music Pavilion, also planned by the Board of 
Management, read as follows: "Who's all right?" "Iowa."</p>

<p>Thus closed the most successful State Day Celebration held during the 
Exposition.</p> 

<p>The attendance from Iowa during this celebration week was not less than 
one hundred and fifty thousand (150,000), the railroads being taxed to their 
utmost to provide transportation for the vast crowds going and coming daily.</p> 

<p>Your Committee regret exceedingly that they could not arrange the date 
for holding the celebration so as to accommodate somespecial organizations 
which were anxious to be present and participate in the celebration, but 
this could not be done, and in view of the fact that the Peace Jubilee was 
so soon to be held on the Exposition Grounds occupying the fu'l week, the 
date fixed, without doubt, proved to be the best possible time for holding the 
celebration.</p> 

<p>In closing the report, your Committee take this opportunity to return 
their thanks and the thanks of the Commission to all, to the Iowa bands for 
their splendid music, to the Dubuque Oratorio Society, and to all others for 
their aid and assistance in making these public exercises and celebrations 
the grand success they were, and to the thousands of intelligent citizens of 
Iowa who by their presence added greatly to the success of these public 
occasions, which were an honor and a credit to our great commonwealth.</p>
