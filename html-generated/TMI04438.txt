ROOSE, Supreme President, Omaha, Neb. THE SOD SHANDY: A Trans-Mississippi Souvenir. NEBRASKA BUILDING, TRANS-MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION, 1898.Published by Morte Parsons, 1810 St. Mary's Avenue, Omaha, Neb.THE LITTLE SOD SHANTY ON THE PLAINS.A TRANS-MISSISSIPPI SONG.Words and Music by MORTE PARSONS.Copyrighted 1898.Far away out west, upon Nebraska's prairies,We came nigh thirty happy years ago;Since then my wife and I have been a toilingFrom morn til night in summer and in snow.We've not been very stylish or progressive,Nor travelled much to spend our scanty gains;We have labored hard, yet lived in health and plentyIn our little old shanty on the plains.You may sing of love in bardic story, olden,Or the meadow's breath, sweet scented with the rains,But you ne'er can sweep the mem'ries sweet and golden,From the little old sod shanty on the plains.But...... now the times have changed out in Nebraska;That old shanty mouldered in the long ago;We have now a mansion large enough for twentyOf our relative and friends who come and go;And we're going to have the grandest ExpositionThat this busy, gay old world has ever seen,And they're coming, for we give to them a welcomeTo the gates of Omaha, Nebraska's Queen." You may sing and talk of fairs and expositions,Of the war and brutal conduct of old Spain,But the world had better look for transportationTo the Trans-Mississippi on the plains."</pre>
