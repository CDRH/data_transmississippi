<p>Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p> 

<p>ORIGIN AND GOVERNMENT.</p> 

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Commercial Congress in convention 
at Omaha in 1895, formulated the following declaration, which 
was introduced by its president, the Hon. W. J. Bryan:</p> 

<p>"WHEREAS, We believe that an exposition of all the products, 
industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi 
river, made at 30me central gateway where the world can behold 
the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth producing 
states, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi 
states, but to all the home seekers in the world; therefore,</p> 

<p><em class="hi">Resolved</em>, That the United States Congress be requested to 
take such steps as may he necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi 
Exposition at Omaha in the Near 1898, and that the representatives of such states and territories in Congress be requested to 
favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in 
carrying out this enterprise.</p> 

<p>The citizens of Omaha, thoroughly alive to the importance 
of this great undertaking, immediately took steps to carry out 
the ideas embodied in this resolution.</p> 

<p>A temporary organization was at once effected and in 
January of the following year articles of incorporation of the 
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Association, 
signed by one hundred of the substantial business and professional men of Omaha, were filed with the secretary of state. 
This corporation is capitalized at $1,000,000 and its government 
is vested in a board of fifty resident directors. Its officers con-

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.012.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.012.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.012.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

sist of a president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer, with 
an additional vice president for each Trans-Mississippi state 
and territory.</p> 

<p>For convenience in conducting - the immense amount of business which necessarily arises, the following- departments were 
formed : Ways and Means, Publicity and Promotion, Buildings 
and Grounds, Exhibits, Concessions and Privileges, and Transportation. The managers of these departments were chosen 
from and by the board of directors for especial fitness in their 
respective departments and they collectively form the executive 
committee.</p> 

<p>GOVERNMENT AND STATE PARTICIPATION.</p> 

<p>According to an act of Congress passed in 1896, the Trans- 
Mississippi and International Exposition was granted recognition as a national and international exhibition, with the 
attendant rights to import exhibits free of duty, to strike 
memorial medals through the mints, and to enjoy all privileges 
heretofore extended to international expositions. The bill carried an appropriation of $200,000 for the erection of a government building and the placing of a suitable government exhibit 
therein. By direction of the President, the State Department 
has extended invitations to all the governments in the civilized 
world, to prepare exhibits and take part in the Exposition. The 
Postoffice Department has authorized the issue of a new series of 
postage stamps of nine denominations in honor of the occasion 
and the designs are typical of the settlement and early history 
of the western country, which this Exposition is held to commemorate.</p> 

<p>Aside from the stock subscriptions and the government 
appropriation, vast sums will be expended by the various states 
of the Union, foreign governments, societies, and individual 
exhibitors. Nebraska has appropriated $100,000, Douglas County 
$100,000, and the City of Omaha through its park board will 
probably expend a like sum in improving and beautifying the 
Exposition grounds. Iowa made a preliminary appropriation of 
$10,000 in 1896, which will probably be increased to $50,000 within 
the next few weeks. Illinois appropriated $45,000, Montana will 
have $30,000 at its disposal; Missouri, while without a state 
appropriation, is through its commercial bodies and individual

citizens, making an active effort to eclipse all other states in its 
great display of products. Wisconsin, Georgia and other eastern 
and southern states will have large and handsome building's, 
wherein to the best advantage to display their manufacturing, 
agricultural and mineral resources, while South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, California, Texas, and in fact almost 
every single Trans-Mississippi state is making collections and 
preparing exhibits for the most extensive exhibition of minerals, 
live stock, fruit and agricultural products that was ever g-athered 
together in the history of the world.</p> 

<p>THE SITE.</p> 

<p>The main part of the Exposition lies slig-htly more than a 
mile north of the business center of the city. Three of the main 
street car lines go directly to one each of the three main 
entrances, while the Belt L,ine connects it with all of the railroads 
which enter Omaha. Kountze tract, 670 feet wide and about 
half a mile in length, is the site of the main group of building 
To the east and at right angles with the Kountze tract and connected with it by a viaduct, lies the bluff tract, about sixty 
acres in area, stretching along the bluffs and overlooking 
the Missouri river. This will be devoted to state buildings and 
concessions. The remainder of the Exposition grounds, consisting of about eighty acres, lies north of the Kountze tract and 
west of Sherman Avenue, and is connected with the bluff tract 
by a second viaduct. Here will be found the live stock exhibit, 
and the model irrigation and beet sugar fields, and here the 
amphitheatre, race course and atheletic fields will be located. 
At the south side of this division will be the space devoted to 
concessionaries, extending across the viaduct into the bluff tract 
on the east, and south from the western end to the grand court. 
The irregularity of the Exposition grounds presented opportunities for great variety in architectural and landscape gardening 
effects which add greatly to the beauty to the general plan.</p> 

<p>ARCHITECTURE.</p> 

<p>A fancy seems to be more or less prevalent, judging from 
some of the written and spoken comments on the Trans-Mississippi Exposition plan, that it largely drew its inspiration from 
the scheme employed at Chicago. "Influence of Chicago"— 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.015.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.015.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.015.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

"reminiscences of the White City"—"revival of the Columbian 
scheme"—and so on, have become rather tiresome phrases in 
connection with the coming- event. This, however, was bound 
to be the fate of every important exhibition since Chicago made 
her memorable display. </p>

<p>In certain particulars it is quite true that the Trans-Mississippi scheme recalls that of the World's Fair—such particulars 
as every exhibition of the kind must have in order to exist successfuly. That is, it includes buildings, staff-covered and filled 
with exhibits ; grounds, set forth with grass and trees, and 
further embellished by a sheet of water ; various provisions foi 
the comfort of visitors ; the whole enclosed by a fence, with turnstiles for entrance and exit. But here the likeness ends, 
comparison of Trans-Mississippi plans and views with those 
published in magazines, etc., during the development of the 
Columbian Exposition, shows to even an ordinal eye the entire 
dissimilarity of the two schemes, as well as of their individual 
buildings and features. It was not any lack of admiration for 
Chicago's splendid achievement that led the architects-in-chief
of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, Messrs. "Walker &amp; Kimball, 
to rely- on their own creative powers for the designing of this 
latest plan. There was really no reason why it should not be ai 
entirely original one, depending on no preceding- one whatever 
for its inspiration ; and this is precisely what has resulted.</p> 

<p>To begin with, our exposition is not on so large a scale as 
that of Chicago, though very much larger than those of Nashville and Atlanta. It is also far more symmetrical and has 
more of a "central idea" than an) r of its predecessors, as ; 
glance at its plan will show. The lagoon, of a beautiful and 
unique form, was evolved out of dry land by clever engineering, 
and is fed from an artesian well and the city water works. Its 
development at the western end into a broad clover-leaf shape, 
gracef ully suggests the place of honor for the United States 
Building, where that representative of our government finds th( 
best point of view as well as the site most appropriate to its 
official dignity. This, by the way, is the first instance where the 
government headquarters have been given their proper precedence over other buildings at an exposition.</p> 

<p>It may be said in passing that this building is far superior 
in design to the corresponding one at Chicago, which, it will be 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.017.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.017.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.017.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

remembered, failed to meet the expectations of connoisseurs in 
architecture. This end of the lagoon, called the Mirror, is the 
most important point on the grounds; and it is from this locality 
that the best view of the exposition is to be had.</p> 

<p>Looking from the Government front, the eye travels along 
the lagoon, about a half mile in length, between two rows of the 
majestic buildings, forming the main court, and finds a resting 
point on the flowered and pinnacled terraces at the opposite end 
before crossing the viaduct to the bluff, a picturesque bit of lane 
rich in festal attractions, with the Missouri lying between it anc 
sunrise.</p> 

<p>From that beautiful group of buildings clustered about the 
lagoon, it would be hard to single out any one for special praisi 
above its fellows. They are all correctly classic in design—a 
point of likeness to the Columbian plan ; but instead of the 
brilliant uniform whiteness of those structures, these are daintily 
decorated in color with occasional gleams of gold, the staff surface, even when plain, being given a warm creamy or ivory tint 
less trying to the eye than the dead white of marble or its imitation. To many tastes, the varied colorings of past Paris expositions, were much more gratifying than the snowy walls of the 
famous White City.</p> 

<p>The Agriculture Building is one which will draw great attention for the richness and originality of its ornament, no less than 
for its very beautiful proportions. The free use of common 
farm yard motives—turkeys, ducks, and the like,—in its ornamentation will prove most taking to the popular fancy, while 
this freedom has not interfered a whit with the closest adherence 
to the canons of classic architecture.</p> 

<p>The Fine Arts Building is distinguished by an open-air 
court, dividing the edifice into two sections—"Twin Buildings" 
so called ; and will be in its scholarly and graceful treatment, 
a fit setting for the collection of artistic gems that is now 
assured. The sculpture surmounting all the buildings is notable 
for its strength of conception and execution. A list of the 
architects for the several buildings comprising the main group, 
who were carefully chosen as representatives of the profession 
in different western cities by the architects-in-chief, include : 
Cass Gilbert, of St. Paul ; Eames &amp; Young, of St. Iyouis ; J. J. 
Humphreys, of Denver; S. S. Bemaii, of Chicago; Dwight

Perkins, of Chicago; Fisher &amp; Laurie, and. Charles F. Beindorf, of Omaha. The manner in which the)' have acquitted 
themselves, as shown in their buildings, makes comment on 
their choice superfluous.</p> 

<p>The two arches facing- each other across the lagoon are 
especially individual in their character, and yet wholly unlike 
each other. The Administration Arch, a building- to be used as 
headquarters for the Exposition officials, is perhaps the most 
striking- of the two, and more markedly foreign in its air, being 
akin to many European monuments of the arch form and having 
a certain Gallic grace about its airy headpiece of spires, that 
will appeal to the trained eye of travelers. The Arch of the 
States, not yet erected, will furnish the state entrance and be a 
permanent momento of 1898. This arch is simple and stately in 
outline, intended to be built from very light stone of uniform 
tint, with a frieze of enamels, showing the coats-of-arms of the 
Trans-Mississippi states in colors.</p> 

<p>It is safe to predict, that the exquisite Miniature City, with 
its display of curious and attractive exhibits gathered from both 
near and distant lands, will cause a thrill of delighted amazement to many thousands of people for whom this section of 
our continent has heretofore been the great unexplored American desert.</p> 

<p>DEPARTMENT OF EXHIBITS.</p> 

<p>This department is under the direction and control of Mr. E. 
E. Bruce as manager, with Mr. H. B. Hardt as assistant. Different 
divisions of its work are carried on by bureaus, independent one 
of another, but all subject to the jurisdiction of the department 
itself. The bureaus are: Fine Arts ; Education; Agriculture: 
Horticulture, Floriculture, Forestry and Irrigation ; Live Stock 
and Dairy ; Bee Industries ; Transportation ; Manufactures and 
Foreign Section ; Machinery ; Electricity ; Mines and Mining ; 
and Fisheries.</p> 

<p>EXHIBITORS' AGENCY.</p> 

<p>This agency has been organized with Mr. O. C. Holmes as 
manager, for the purpose of giving facilities to such exhibitors 
as do not wish to place special representatives in charge of their 
exhibits.</p>

<p>ART EXHIBIT.</p> 

<p>The collection of the Art Exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi 
and International Exposition has been placed in the hands of 
Mr. A. H. Griffith, now director of the Detroit Museum of Art. 
with an Advisory Board, consisting- of the directors of the Western 
Art Association, with Mr. Paul Charlton as its chairman.</p> 

<p>Active work has been going on in connection with it since 
the summer of 1897, and the results already secured, promise to 
carry out fully the idea with which it was begun, viz : That the 
collection of pictures should be thoroughly representative, wide 
in scope and of the highest excellence possible to be secured in 
the available collections, public and private, in this country, and 
from artists and collections abroad. Honorary commissioners 
have been appointed for most of the states and foreign countries, 
among them M. Ferd. Meyer, Paris; Rollsshoeven, England; De 
Groote for Holland and Belgium: General Crosby, Massachusetts; 
Cyrus J. Eawrence, Esq., for New York; Daniel Baugh, Esq., for 
Pennsylvania; R. Hall McCormick, Esq., for Illinois, and many 
others similarly well known in business and artistic circles. 
Provision has been made for the absolute protection of the more 
important pictures in fire and burglar proof vaults, and the twin 
buildings in which the collections will be housed, were designed 
by Messrs. Eames &amp; Young, of St. Louis, to give the most perfect fire protection and at the same time wall space and lighting 
far more adequate than has housed any recent permanent or 
temporary exhibit. Instead of medals and diplomas, usually so 
little desired by artists, there is a guarantee fund for the purchase of at least $5,000 worth of pictures shown at this exhibition, which meets the desires of exhibitors, both domestic and 
foreign. In addition to oil and water-color paintings, and 
pastels, there will be a large exhibit of old masters in the modern 
photographic reproductions; an important exhibit of the modern 
methods of fine art reproduction, and the exhibit of mural cartoons and paintings promises to be the most important yet shown 
in the United States. The cut of the building gives an adequate 
idea both of its architecture an extent.</p> 

<p>Communications in regard to the Fine Arts Exhibit should 
be addressed to Mr. A. H. Griffith, up to April 1, 1898, at Detroit, 
Mich.; after that date at Omaha, Nebraska.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF AGRICULTURE, HORTICULTURE, FLORICULTURE, FORESTRY AND IRRIGATION.</p> 

<p>Under the care of this bureau all sorts of modern appliances 
of agriculture will be exhibited, while agricultural products will 
be displayed in a way to demonstrate their respective values in 
the Trans-Mississippi region. In this connection, an irrigating 
exhibit in operation has been planned to cover ten acres. The 
Horticultural Building is one of the most beautiful and extensive 
on the grounds and will practically demonstrate the magnitude 
and promise of the fruit-growing industries of the Great "West. 
This bureau is collectively under the superintendency of Prof. 
F. W. Taylor.</p> 

<p>BUREAU OF LIVE STOCK AND DAIRY.</p> 

<p>Hon. J. B. Dinsmore is commissioner of this bureau, which 
has live stock and poultrj r exhibits so planned as to offer features 
of interest throughout the Exposition period. The relative 
values of different breeds of milch cows will be tested by the 
manufacture of butter and cheese in the Dairy Building. All 
live stock exhibits will be held in the months of September and 
October.</p> 

<p>BUREAU OF BEE INDUSTRIES.</p> 

<p>In the Apiary Building will be arranged exhibits of great 
value to bee keepers, from hive and flower to the honey ready for 
shipment. Its interest to the visitor is assured by the commissioner for this bureau, Hon. E. Whitcomb.</p> 

<p>BUREAU OF ELECTRICITY.</p> 

<p>This bureau is under the direction of Prof. R. B. Owens. 
Special exhibits of electrical interest in this section will be of 
electricity in agricultural work ; long distance power transmission ; Recent application of electricity in power distribution ; 
electricity in mining ; electro-metallurgical processes ; long 
distance telephony. Other features of interest will be search 
lights, high frequency and high potential apparatus, electricity 
for domestic use and the transmission of intelligence by Hertzen 
waves.</p>

<p>BUREAU OF MANUFACTURES AND FOREIGN SECTION.</p> 

<p>Over these two bureaus the department has retained exclusive 
control, both to preserve harmony in the classification and 
grouping of the immense variety of exhibits, and to insure 
foreign exhibits equal consideration with those of domestic 
origin.</p> 

<p>BUREAU OF MACHINERY.</p> 

<p>In the Machinery Building will be found all kinds of useful 
machinery, much of it in actual operation and driven by electricity transmitted by belt or wire from the Power Plant Annex, 
whose powerful engines constitute in themselves a wonderful 
exhibit. While there will be an extensive exhibit of mining and 
other machinery used in the Trans-Mississippi country, the display will by no means be confined to that class. All the recent 
inventions and improvements in machinery of all kinds will be 
in evidence. Prof. C. R. Richards is commissioner of the 
Machinery Bureau.</p> 

<p>BUREAU OF MINES AND MINING.</p> 

<p>This bureau has charge of the display of ores and minerals, 
of live exhibits illustrative of the process of metal-refining, etc. 
The Mines and Mining Building will far outrank in the size and 
variety of its exhibits anything of the kind heretofore seen in 
this or any other country, and will demonstrate the position of 
the Trans-Mississippi region among the foremost of mineral 
producing countries.</p> 

<p>BUREAU OF FISHERIES.</p> 

<p>Upon the recommendation of Hon. W. L,. May, U. S. fish 
commissioner for the Nebraska district, the United States Government has consented to take charge of the fisheries exhibits, 
and by a series of grottos and cases of glass will make a display 
which, for purposes of beauty as well as of instruction, has never 
been surpassed by any exposition of pisciculture.</p>

<p>MUSIC.</p> 

<p>The elaborate musical programs that are now being- prepared 
will insure the grandest musical, festival, continuing from the 
opening to the closing day, that was ever known in the West. 
It is intended to make this one of the strong points of the Exposition and it is certain from the proposals already received that 
this will be an occasion long to be remembered as the grandest 
musical entertainment that the highest talent of this and 
foreign countries can produce. While at this writing dates cannot be given it is an assured fact that the most noted bands and 
orchestras of Germany, France, England and other foreign 
countries will be present, among them the famous Mexican 
Military Band. The greatest soloists from all countries, including Italy, Austria, and Germany will participate while oratorios 
and grand operas will be presented on the most elaborate scale. 
There will be a vast assemblage of the Swedish singing societies 
of this country and choruses of thousands of voices will be given.</p> 

<p>WOMAN'S DEPARTMENT.</p> 

<p>The Woman's Department consists of two representatives 
from each of the six congressional districts of Nebraska, with 
eleven fiom Omaha, two from South Omaha, and two from 
Council Bluffs, Iowa. It has charge of the educational features 
of the Exposition both as to exhibits and congresses on educational, scientific, and philosophical subjects, and of various 
classes of woman's work.</p> 

<p>There is to be no woman's building, as the department is of 
the opinion that there is no occasion in this age of the world for 
separating the work of men and women, but there will be a 
building devoted to the use of girls and boys, and this will be 
under the jurisdiction of the Woman's Board.</p> 

<p>Although the funds for the erection of the Girls' and Boys' 
Building have been contributed by the children and young 
people of the Trans-Mississippi region, the work of collecting 
them has been accomplished by women to the number of several 
hundred, who have been associated with the Woman's Depart

ment as patronesses, and who have gathered the contributions 
from their respective neighborhoods.</p> 

<p>The building will contain a hall where lectures and addresses 
will be given, where children may be entertained, and where 
they will in turn entertain their friends, and where various new 
ideas in the line of school and class work will be elaborated 
through living exhibits. It will have a creche where young 
children may be cared for and a restaurant where wholesome 
food of a sort suitable to children will be provided. The building will also contain exhibits of interest not only to boys and 
girls, but to parents and teachers.</p> 

<p>The educational exhibits will be of two classes : Collective 
exhibits from schools, and individual competitions by enrolled 
pupils. Under the first-class some very interesting collections 
of school work will be shown. The Nebraska Exposition Commission has purchased space sufficient for the exhibit of the 
school resources of the state, and collegiate institutions, special, 
professional, and technical schools will be well represented.</p> 

<p>Under individual competitions a series of topics is suggested 
in six lines of work, viz: Histor3% composition, penmanship, 
drawing, manual training, and nature study. These have been 
arranged for all grades and ages, from the kindergarten to the 
universit)'. The exhibit is entered in the name of the pupil, 
upon an entrv fee of twent^vfive cents. When the competitions 
close, April 15th, the awards of gold, silver and bronze medals 
will be made, and exhibits winning prizes will be placed in the 
Exposition without further charge.</p> 

<p>The Congress Committee will endeavor to provide, through 
a series of programmes, for the discussion of some of the topics 
of public interest, which are not represented in the various conventions which are to be held in connection with the Exposition. 
Several days will be given to the consideration of art, subdivided 
as may seem feasible, but with sessions devoted especially to 
architecture and ceramics. Music will be given a congress of 
from three to five days. Literature will embrace an Authors' 
Congress and a Librarians' Conference. Public matters will be 
considered under at least two heads : Municipal Problems and 
Public Health. Philantropy will receive attention through a 
conference on charities and corrections and there will be a con-

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.031.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.031.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.031.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span> 

gress of Liberal Religions, as well as one for the consideration 
of all forms of Christian activity. The women will be associated 
in several conventions. The W. C. T. U. will have a programme. 
So will the General Federation of Women's Clnbs and the P.E.O. 
There will also be a Mothers' Congress.</p> 

<p>IRRIGATION.</p> 

<p>The irrigation exhibit will perhaps be of more actual value 
to the western states than any other feature of the Exposition. 
A field of ten acres, under the charge of the Department of 
Agriculture, will be operated as an irrigated farm. Here will be 
displayed the latest and most approved methods of irrigation and 
there will be shown the possibilities of diversified farming under 
this system. Irrigation has done much already toward reclaiming the arid lands of the west, and the extension of a perfected 
irrigation system will add millions of acres to the valuable farm 
lands of this country.</p> 

<p>TRANSPORTATION.</p> 

<p>This exhibit includes all articles designed for carrrying purposes from a cash carrier to an air ship, and from a baby carriage to a Pullman palace car or a powerful six drive wheel 
engine. It will show the gradual transformation of the Indian 
canoe into the modern man-of-war, the heavy lumbering- ox 
cart into the latest pneumatic tired horseless carriage, and the 
old-time coach into the modern vestibuled train which makes its 
run across the continent at the rate of a mile a minute. Here 
will be displayed the first railroad engine ever used in America, 
together with many others, which collectively illustrate the 
gradual improvements to the present time. In the Transportation Building, on steel tracks running through the main aisles, 
will be exhibits of the latest and most palatially equipped 
trains of cars, locomotives, day coaches and palace sleeping cars 
ever shown at any exposition.</p> 

<p>A special feature will be made of all kinds of vehicles and 
conveyances, resulting- from application of the principles 
employed in bicycle construction, together with new methods of 
producing- motive power. In the transportation of visitors about 
the grounds the horseless carriages will be found a great 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.032.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.032.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.032.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

improvement over the wheeling- chairs used at the World's Fair. 
All of the latest improvements in vehicles, such as the motorcycle intended to replace carriages, and farm and other heavy 
truck wagons operated by compressed air and electricity, will 
be displayed for the examination of visitors.</p> 

<p>The marine feature of the Exposition will be one of the most 
extensive ever prepared for public inspection. It will show the 
Roman and Viking g-alleys of ancient times as well as the latest 
improvements in the war and passenger ships of the present day.</p> 

<p>INDIAN EXHIBIT.</p> 

<p>An exhibit of extraordinary interest, both to the casual 
observer and the student of ethnology, will be the gathering of 
the representative types of all the different Indian tribes on the 
North American continent. This will show in the most graphic 
manner the progress of the Indian towards civilization. It will 
show tribes in the utmost state of savagery, with their appropriate abodes, dress, utensils, weapons, games and amusements, 
forms and ceremonies, ceremonial objects, burial structures, etc., 
and it will show the highly civilized tribes, with their modern 
dwellings, their printing- presses and their books in the Indian 
language. The civilized tribes of the Five Nations of the Indian 
Territory, living under their own form of government, will here 
show their traits, their peculiarities, their weakness, and on 
many points their superiority over their white brethren. Incident 
to the encampment will be exemplified the nrysterious side of the 
character of the red man. The folk lore of the Indian— rich in 
legends, the system of heraldry in use for ages with its sig-ns 
and symbols, mysterious sig-nincance and ceremonies, and the 
different kinds of decorations, the sig-nincance of the device, its 
origin and the ceremony accompanying* its consecration, will all 
illustrate a new departure in the line of ethnological research 
adopted by Mr. James Mooney, of the Bureau of Ethnology.</p> 

<p>There will be a reproduction, historically correct in all its 
details, of the last great council of the amalgamated tribes of 
the Kiowas and Apaches. This encampment will cover about 
four acres and consist of 250 tepees. This will be only a part, 
however, of the great Indian town, as it is intended to bring- at 
least twelve types of each of all the different tribes now livingin North America.</p>

<p>MILITARY ENCAMPMENT.</p> 

<p>The proposed mobilization of the troops of the regular army 
and the National Guard at Omaha during the Exposition, will 
be the largest military assemblage held in the United States 
since the mustering out of the troops at the close of the civil war, 
The greater portion of the troops of the regular army has each 
year been detailed into moving columns for the practice of 
tactical maneuvers, and the National Guard has held annual 
encampments in each state for the same purpose. It is thought 
that their formation into a great army would produce results in 
the form of field practice not attainable in any other way. It 
would at the same time be an object lesson to the vast crowd: 
assembled here of the military strength of this country not 
realized by the ordinary citizen in these days of peace.</p> 

<p>There will probably be a large encampment of veterans of 
the war at Omaha during the Exposition, as at the Buffalo 
encampment of the G. A. R. a movement was inaugurated to 
that end.</p> 

<p>AMUSEMENTS.</p> 

<p>That part of the Exposition devoted strictly to the amusement features of the great show is exceptionally strong. Applications have been made to the Department of Concessions for 
space, which would cover more than ten times as much ground 
as is at the disposal of that department. Consequently there has 
been abundant opportunity for careful selection, and onl) r those 
attractions which provide novel and interesting entertainment 
have been accepted. For each concession granted, the management has exacted guarantees that the execution of the design 
will follow the proposal in every respect. The active investigation which has been going on in the direction of mechanical and 
especially electrical novelties since the World's Fair, will insure 
the most striking display ever produced at any exposition. The 
following is a short description of a few of the many strong 
attractions which the Department of Concessions is considering:</p> 

<p><strong>Sherman's Umbrella</strong> is a stupenduous mechanical invention, 
which will stand 350 feet high and be anchored in a stone foundation 30 feet deep and 75 feet square. It will be 40 feet in diameter 
and consist of iron and steel. The ribs of this gigantic umbrella 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.035.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.035.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.035.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

are to be 110 feet in length, at the extremities of which the curs 
are to be suspended. There will be sixteen of these cars, with a 
carrying capacity of about forty each. The lower platform will 
also be used for passengers and will accommodate about 200. 
When the umbrella is closed these cars will touch the ground, 
uid when raided the passengers will enjoy a ride in a merry-goround at an elevation of 250 feet. As this will be constructed on 
me bluff many feet above the river, a splendid bird s eye-view 
may be had of the country for miles around, the city, and the 
entire Exposition grounds. At night the tower will be brilliantly 
illuminated by electricity, while at the apex a powerful search 
light will be placed. This stream of light may be seen at a distance of one hundred miles.</p> 

<p><strong>The Submarine Theatre</strong>. One proposition which has met 
with much favor by the Exposition authorities, is the proposal 
nstruct a lake with a correct representation of a Turkish 
harem on a Boating island in the center of the lake. The 
entrance to this harem will be by mean, of a diving car, which 
plunges beneath the surface oi the water and descends to a 
depth of thirty feet. During this submarine voyage the passengers are given a beautiful view of fish and plant life through 
the glass sides of the car. At the bottom of this lake the visitors 
find themselves in the mosl exclusive part of the harem. This is 
a beautiful, glittering grotto, in which the favorite beauties of 
me sultan's fairy land are grouped in artistic pictures, the 
whole being brilliantly Lighted by a submarine system of colored 
electric Lights.</p> 

<p><strong>Wild West Show</strong>. Daring feats of horsemanship, the pony 
express, the Indian attack on the old-time stage coach, skillful 
footing, cowboys, scouts, hunters and trappers, with representation of their daily life, a reproduction of the Custer massacre, 
and other historical incidents, will make up the continuous 
exhibition of the Wild West Show.</p> 

<p><strong>Cyclorama of the Battle of Lookout Mountain</strong>, will be an 
historically correct reproduction of this famous battle. This 
scene will vividly depict in life-sized figures the contending 
armies. In the foreground are seen heavy bodies of troops 
engaged and the artillery working their guns, supported by longlines of infantry in reserve, awaiting the coming charge. On

the flanks the cavalry appear cutting, slashing and hewing with 
their heavy sabers in their attempt to break the stubborn lines. [unclear] 
The field is strewn with the dead and dying, with dismoun [unclear]
cannon, and the discarded implements of war. Now and then
through the rising smoke may be seen the glare of the heavy  
guns as they belch their contents into the advancing ran 
The wonderful realism of this great spectacle will bring forcible 
to all minds the heroism, the grandeur, and the awful havoc 
one of the great battles of history.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado's Crystal Cave</strong> will occupy 3,000 feet of space. The exterior will represent a Colorado mountain, covered with rock [unclear] 
and the natural trees and shrubs. Visitors will enter through 
widening shafts, studded with electric lights into brilliant 
illuminated apartments, where the state's mineral resources will
be artistically displayed. In the center of the main chamber an 
elaborate fountain will discharge the different mineral water 
for which Colorado is noted, while from mysterious caverns which
echo the strains of soft, sweet music and add enchantment to
this beautiful fairyland.</p> 

<p><strong>Wine Cascade</strong>. The wine makers of California are preparing 
a minature reproduction of the great Niag-ara. The rocks and 
precipices at the falls will be represented in glass, while the 
water will be represented by the red wine of California. 100,000 
g-allons of wine will be used and after the torrent passes over 
the falls, it will be returned by hidden conduits to continue it 
ceaseless course.</p> 

<p><strong>The Electric Theatre</strong> is a handsome building, capable of 
seating 150 persons. The interior is tastefully fitted up, the 
walls being hung with painting-s, and together with the effects 
from the stained glass windows, the appearance is very beautiful 
Among the many novel scenes presented will be the different 
phases of day and night, such as "Midnight," "Dawn," "Day," 
"Sunrise," "Noon," "Approach of Storm." "Passing of Storm 
and Rainbow," "Sunset," "Moonlight," "Stars," etc. Night and 
the Thunderstorm are represented by Mephistopheles, who 
gives fantastic dances. Day and Dawn are portrayed by a 
beautiful young lady, who enlivens the scene by an artistic skirt 
dance. The Approach of Storm is heralded by heat and chain 
lightning which gives the most weird effect imaginable.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.037.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.037.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.037.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p><strong>Novel Electrical Displays</strong>. The recent inventions and 
pertinents in electricity by Edison, Lord Kelvin. Thomson, 
einmetz, Trask, Peabody and others, will be illustrated in 
endless ways. Mr. Stieringer, who designed the electrical fountain at the World's Fair, has been engaged as consulting 
eletrical engineer of the Exposition. The effects obtained in 
the night illumination of the Exposition grounds will be 
of iterest to scientists as well as a most delightful revelation to 
the great crowds of pleasure seekers. Among the many wonerful sights provided by this agency will be an electrical 
garden, showing the various hues and tints of the flowers by 
gleans of colored screens and powerful searchlights, and demontrations of searchlight effects on moving waters the Missouri 
river for a long distance and also the bluffs on either side, showing strange and wonderful effects developed by the aid of 
electrical science.</p> 

<p><strong>Shooting the Chutes</strong> is one of the most healthful, invigorating and joyous amusement in the list of outdoor sports. The plant 
to be erected at the Exposition will represent an outlay of about 
$25,000, and will be the largest in existence. It is built something after the fashion of a huge toboggan slide, starting from 
the top of which boats filled with passengers rush down the 
steep incline and bound over the water in the lake.</p> 

<p><strong>The Scenic Railway</strong>, about two-thirds of a mile in length, is operated by the force of gravity, aided at times by an endless 
cable. The train passes over a road showing some very beautiful scenery prepared for the purpose. Sometimes high in the 
air, again passing through tunnels illuminated by electrical 
flash lights in colors.</p> 

<p><strong>Moorish Village</strong>. This will be one of the largest and most 
pretentious of the amusement features of the Exposition. In the 
first building several optical illusions will beshown. Beyond the 
series of Moorish arches is a Large open air area, planted with 
trees and decorated with fountains, flowers and statuary, after 
the style of a Moorish court, where concert and regular highclass vaudeville will be given. The first of its buildings is a low 
structure, with two dome capped towers in staff gilded and made 
to resemble repousse gold. Towering above this building and 
forming the further side of an open court will be the palace, the 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.038.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.038.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.038.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

main feature of the group, in the form of a mosque with large 
central dome and corner spires. The intervening court, with its 
frivolous open air theatre, will be a veritable tropical garden, 
masked from the public street by a double colonnade of Moorish 
arches, roofed with tiles. Next beyond this green and gold 
creation will be a Moorish house, correct in all its details, and 
groups of shops, gay with eastern rugs and metal trinkets. The 
large central building, surmounted by a magnificent dome, will 
be the Moorish palace, and in it will be displayed an interesting 
series of tableaux and figures in wax, together with a Chamber 
of Horrors and a Devil's Cave. The costumes and swords alone 
for one of the large groups will cost $15,000, and more than 
$75,000 will be expended on the interior of the palace.</p> 

<p><strong>Moorish Mystic Maze</strong> consists of a labyrinth or maze of 
mirrors, unspeakably bewildering to the visitor. From the 
polished surface of the plate glass mirrors, placed at different 
angles, dozens of reflections transform yourself into a marching 
regiment and the slightest gesture is taken up and produces 
effects indescribably rediculous. From the moment of entrance 
all traces of entrance and exit disappear, and you have the novel 
experience of being lost, in company with a hundred reproductions of yourself. The effect of this scene is heightened by being 
brilliantly illuminated by electricity. </p>

<p><strong>Other Novelties</strong>. A miniature train, consisting of a locomotive, tender, four observation cars, one box car and caboose—in 
all twenty-nine feet long—will be operated daily for the transportation of children. The cars are forty-one inches long and 
fourteen inches wide, and two children can be comfortably 
seated in each car.</p> 

<p>An elevated railway will convey passengers to and from 
various points on the grounds on pedal propelled machines, 
operated on a double track of steel rails.</p> 

<p>A miniature Nicaragua canal will be produced by a representative of the Chilian government, showing the typography of the 
Isthmus and the engineering feats accomplished and necessary 
to be accomplished before the completion of the real canal. </p>

<p>The German, Irish, Chinese, Tyrolean, Moorish and other 
typical national villiages, will show the true home life, architecture, costumes, etc., of the people represented.</p>

performance, "Old Vienna," showing quaint types and customs

buildings, wonderful labyrinths, formed with mirrors and illuminated by electricity, an Old Plantation Scene, strange and wonderful water crafts and horseless carriages and numberless other 
attractions, new, beautiful, interesting and instructive—so far

<p>THE MILLARD.</p> 

<p>J. E. Markel &amp; Son. proprietors. Thirteenth and Douglas 
streets. Due largely to the liberality of the management, the 
excellence of the service and its unsurpassed table. The Millard 
is now considered not only the leading hotel of Omaha, but of 
the entire west. The building is a handsome five-story structure 
of brick, with 200 rooms and a frontage on two streets ; is convenient to business, and all street car lines pass the doors, and 
while practically tire proof, is provided with ample tiro escapes 
on every floor, and equipped with the celebrated Bon nor Stand 
pipe. Most extensive improvements have just been completed, 
and the hotel is now Lighted by electricity from a complete plant 
upon the premises. Freezing machines make all the ice used 
from pure boiled and filtered water. Sixty now bath rooms, 
with most modem sanitary plumbing, and perfect ventilation, 
have been added, and the kitchen equipped now entirely, including ranges and steam tables. We have no hesitancy in pronouncing the Millard one of the most modern hotels in the 
country, and visitors to the Trans-Mississippi and International 
Exposition will find their stay at this celebrated hostelry most 
congenial.</p> 

<p>THE HOTEL DELLONE,</p> 

<p>located at the corner of Fourteenth and Capitol Avenue, is the 
only fire proof hotel in the state, and with the new annex, is also 
the largest. The hotel is conducted on the European plan; prices 
ranging from $1.00 per day and upward, and has a capacity of 
caring for 700 to 800 people daily. Street cars for the Exposition, South Omaha, Council Bluffs, and all depots, pass the door. 
The hotel was opened in August. 1896, by W. W. Coates, who is 
still manager. Meals are served OH both the cafe and regular 
plan at reasonable prices.</p> 

<p>THE BRIDENBECKER RESTAURANT,</p> 

<p>Oyster and Fish House, established in May. 1888. It is now, 
and always has been, the leading medium-priced ladies and 
gentlemen restaurant in Omaha. A nice, large and ventilated 
room. Good home-like cooking, quick service. We make our own 
pastry. The best coffee in the city. Lunches put up to take out.

Everything served in season. Meals served at all hours. Onehalf block each from the Thirteenth and Fourteenth street car 
lines. Farnam street cars pass the door. Telephone 821. Open 
all night; 1312 Farnam street. Omaha. Neb.</p>

<p>THE NEW MERCER.</p> 

<p>The Exposition managers arc much pleased with the opening of this hotel to the public, which event was celebrated February 1. The Mercer is a seven-story brick structure, thoroughly 
fireproof and with its ISO rooms and 50 bath rooms was a welcome 
addition to the hotel accommodations of the Exposition City. 
The hotel will be under the management of Dick Smith, at one 
lime &gt;tate representative and later senator. F. J. Coates, 
proprietor of the Riley, is president of the company and is making a specialty of conventions.</p>

<p>Early History of Omaha.</p> 

<p>"The city is the nerve center of our civilization,' says Dr. 
Josiah Strong. This is demonstrated in "The Winning of the 
West," and the history of Omaha; its birth as a prairie hamlet 
and its magical growth into the splendid proportions of a commercial metropolis, is to some extent the history of the progress of 
civilization in the northwest. This marvelous growth has been 
attained within the memory and the span of life of the city's 
first settlers, who built their cabins on the west bank of the 
Missouri river in 1854. a succinct history of this nerve center of 
the Trans-Mississippi country has much of interest in it, even 
when limited to a general outline with detail- referred to their 
special departments.</p> 

<p>Its early history has the charm of romance. The Lewis and 
Clark expedition from St. Louis to the Pacific ocean encamped 
on a plateau now forming a northwestern part of Omaha. In 
1825 a J. B. Royce is said to have established an Indian trading post 
on the site of the present city of Omaha. But by tar the most 
important immigration of white men into Douglas canity was 
what is known in history as the "Mormon Advent," which 
occurred after the expulsion of the Mormons from Nauvoo, 
Ill., in 1844. After the departure of the Mormons, or from about 
1H47 until 1853, there is no authentic record of white- visiting this 
section either as prospectors or for pleasure. The honorof being 
the first permanent white settler to stake a claim within the 
limits of Omaha is conferred by some upon Mr. William D. 
Brown; but the statements made in this connection by Mr. A. D. 
Jones, who is still residing in this city, would indicate that he 
is rightly entitled to this distinction.</p> 

<p>In June. 1853 Dr. Enos Lowe Jesse Williams, Joseph Street. 
William D. Brown, and Jesse Lowe, of Council Bluffs, Iowa. 
organized a ferry and town company and determined on founding a town across the river.</p> 

<p>By the treaty promulgated June 24. 1854, the Indian title to 
the land in Douglas county was extinguished, or nearly half a

century after the consummate wisdom of Jefferson had acquired 
from France for the United States the title to the northwest 
territory. Early in the spring- of 1854 settlers commenced to 
locate upon the new purchase from the Omahas. Among the 
settlers during this first year of Omaha were A. D. Jones, J. Fv. 
Johnson, Robert B. Whitted, George Armstrong, O. D. Richardson, John Davis, Mr. Seelej', Wm. Clancey, Lyman Richardson, 
Thos. Swift, Jeffrey Brothers, Harrison Jonson, John M. Thayer, 
J. C. Reeves, Jos. Hickey, Ben Leonard, Samuel E. Rogers, Gen. 
K. Estabrook, C. A. Downs, Mr. Dodd, William Rogers, A. R. 
Gilmore, W. P. Snowden, O. B. Seldon, A. J. Hanscom. J. W. 
Paddock, William Gray, John Withnell, A. J. Poppleton, Dr. 
George L. Miller. Lorin Miller, J. G. Megeath, and some few 
others. From 1854 to 1859 the settlers came and located in 
Omaha, whose energy, liberality, persistency, judgment, public 
spirit and foresight became important factors in the development of the embryo city. It is the first settlers who impress 
themselves and their character on the future. Powerful influences may, in later years, produce important modifications ; but it 
is early influence which is farthest reaching, and is generalsdecisive. And the city reflects today the sterling character of 
the early settlers.</p> 

<p>The first survey of the city was made by the Council Bluffs 
&amp; Nebraska Ferry Company. When Nebraska was admitted as 
a territory on May 23, 1854. the gentlemen composing the company saw the importance of securing a town site on'the west bank 
of the Missouri. Mr. A. D. Jones was employed to make the survey, assisted by Captain C. H. Downs, who carried the chains 
and drove the stakes. Both these gentlemen are now living in 
Omaha, and they completed the work early in July. 1854. Mr. 
Jones laid out the town site so that it contained 320 blocks, each 
264 feet square, intersected by streets 100 feet wide except Capitol Avenue, which was made 120 feet wide. Alleys 20 feet wide 
run through the blocks, and the lots were made 66x132 feet 
except business lots, which were given a frontage of 22 feet. The 
base line of the survey was Davenport street. The city receives 
the name from the Omaha tribe of Indians, and it is said that 
Mr. Jesse Lowe, deceased, suggested '"Omaha" as the name for 
the new settlement. Two traditions are connected with the 
word, one as follows : The name "Omaha," by Indian tradition,

originated in something like the following manner: Two bands 
of Indians met in deadly battle on the Missouri river, in which 
all on one side were killed, except one Indian, who had been 
thrown into the river. Suddenly rising from what his enemies 
thought was a watery grave, he lifted his head above the surface 
of the water and pronounced the word "Omaha," which none 
had ever before heard. Its meaning was, therefore, thought to 
be, that the supposed drowning Indian was above the water and 
not, as his enemies and those who heard it, supposed under the 
water. The other origin attributed to the word is: That the 
Omaha Indians, until comparatively recent times, were called the 
Mahas. The signification of the name being said to be "Theup-river-people." It is properly pronounced O-maw-haw, with 
no accent at all upon any of the three syllables.</p> 

<p>It was not until the legislature of 1857 passed an act incorporating "The City of Omaha," and making "the middle of the 
main channel of the Missouri river" the east line of the city, 
that municipal government became a fact. On February 2, 1857, 
the new charter became a law. Prior to this the town had been 
Omaha City, but when the legal right to the pretentious suffix 
was bestowed, it was dropped and the town became simply 
"Omaha." Before this time the county officials had conducted 
the public business. The new law passed the business of "The 
City of Omaha" over to a mayor, nine aldermen, recorder, 
treasurer, assessor, and marshal. This was the genesis of our 
present government. The ma3'ors of the city have been: Jesse 
Lowe, 1857; A. J. Poppleton, March to September 1858; George 
Armstrong, Sept., 1858 to March, 1859; D. D. Belden, 1859; Clinton Briggs, 1860; George Armstrong, March, 1861, to Nov., 1862

<p>Two things materially aided the growth of Omaha and added 
their tribute of prosperity to crown with success the enterprise 
and sagacity of its founders. The first was the locating- of the 
territorial capitol at Omaha. Hon. Francis Burt, a native of 
South Carolina, was appointed the first governor of Nebraska 
after its organization as a territory, by act of Congress on May 
30, 1854. Before the meeting- of the first territorial legislature, 
and in just ten days from his arrival in the territory, Governor 
Burt died. His secretary, Hon. T. B. Cummings, became acting 
governor. Governor Cummings designated Omaha as the place 
where the first session of the legislature should be held, and this 
act gave the opportune prestage over other rival claimants. For 
thirteen years and until in 1867, an act of congtess, providing 
for the admission of Nebraska as a state, was ratified bv the 
legislature in session in this citv, Omaha was made the territorial 
capitol. Of this the Hon. James W. Savage says: ''Whatever 
the motive or reason, the action of Governor Cummings settled 
the question so far as the first assemblage of the legislature was 
concerned, and gave to the ambitious little City of Omaha that 
prestage which enabled her, not without importunity, lavish 
expenditure of money, great parliamentary shrewdness and even 
at times a resort to the powerful logic of fisticuffs, to retain its 
position as the metropolis for nearly thirteen years." This 
advantage in the cradle of her infancy was seized to extend the 
city westward from the dreary "bottoms" and to establish upon 
the plateau the imperial tent of a commercial metropolis, the 
pride of whose strength is not yet.</p> 

<p>The excitement connected with the "Pawnee war" broke the 
dull monotony of frontier life; and the rush for gold to Pike's 
Peak and the sands of Cherry creek made Omaha an outfitting 
and freighting point that filled our streets with life and caused 
business to thrive. While these added their tribute to our prosperity, they were not nearly so important to the cit3 r 's future 
welfare as the locating and building of the Union Pacific railroad, that was to touch the waste plains with governmental life 
for budding towns and fertile farms. As Dr. George L,. Miller, 
for many years the distinguished editor of "The Omaha Herald," 
so well phrases it: "Omaha was practically extinguished under 
the financial avalanche of 1857 and did not emerge from its 
effects until the advent of the railroads." With the approach of 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.055.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.055.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.055.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the spring of 1859, however, came the return of the tide of immigration, and as this city was not regarded with the least favor 
not a few came to remain and to identify themselves with the 
city and surrounding country.</p> 

<p>In 1860 Omaha had a population of 1861; in 1870, 16,083: in 
1880, 30,518, and in 1890. 140,452. In ten years, we have advanced 
from sixty-fourth to twenty-first place in the list of American 
cities. The increase both in population and commercial importance has been rapid, and the present growth of the city is all 
that could be desired. Today "it delights us to remember these 
things," and the history of the city's rise and progress clothes 
the naked truth with the charm of romance.</p> 

<p>NEBRASKA.</p> 

<p>Nebraska was included in the Louisiana purchase and for 
many years formed a part of the northwest territory. It was 
organized as a territory in 1854 under the Kansas and Nebraska 
bill. It extended wot to the Rocky Mountains and north to the 
British possessions, having an area of 351,558 square miles.</p> 

<p>The Dakotas, Colorado, and other states, were afterwards 
formed under separate territorial governments, and Nebraska 
consists at present of 77,510 square miles, the eleventh in area of 
the states of the Union. Nebraska was admitted as a state in 
1867. The surface of Nebraska is chiefly an elevated prairie, 
very level in the central and eastern portions, but growing 
broken towards the north and west. The atmosphere IS dry and 
Invigorating, and owing to the elevation the extremes of heat 
and cold are not so noticeable as in other parts of the country.</p> 

<p>The soil of Nebraska is mostly a rich mould, two to eight 
feet in depth. The staple crop is Indian corn, and on well conducted farms a yield of fifty to sixty bushels per acre is not 
unusual. Wheat, oats, barley, and all the crops common to the 
central west, are grown in enormous quantities. The soil of the 
state is particularly adapted to the cultivation of the sugar beet, 
and it promises soon to rank with corn as the staple product of 
the state. Several beet sug-ar factories have already been 
established, and others are in process of erection. Nebraska has 
always stood well as a stock raising- state, and large numbers of 
cattle and sheep are shipped in from surrounding states and fed

on Nebraska corn. Portions of the state, that have been subject 
to the drought, are being rapidly put under irrigation, and 
Nebraska is now capable of supporting an enormous population.</p> 

<p>THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI STATES</p> 

<p>and territories, under whose auspices the Exposition is held, was 
no part of the Federal Union before 1803. The Louisiana purchase of that year, the annexation of Texas in 1845, the division 
of the Oregon country in 1846, the Mexican cession in 1848, the 
further cession in 1853, and the Alaska purchase in 1867, makes 
up the whole of that vast scope of country which now has 
almost one-third of the population of the United States, which 
includes more than one-half of the units of the states and territories and which comprises more than two-thirds of the 
of the total area of the United States. This country, with a 
breadth of more than two thousand miles and extending 
almost from the torrid to the frigid zone, has every variety of 
climate, every grade of elevation and every advantag-e of geological formation which could make it great and prosperous. Its 
population has increased in the last generation from six to 
twenty millions, and its wealth has increased at a far greater 
ratio. It produces practically all of the precious minerals of the 
United States and the development of its coal, copper, lead and 
iron mines has just begun. It includes within its boundaries 
nearly all of the sugar producing lands of the United States, the 
greater portion of the cotton belt, great forests of valuable 
timber, the best of fruit producing lands, and is the greatest 
grain and live stock region in the world. Education has kept 
pace with material progress; the free school has followed every 
settler's camp, high schools and colleges have grown with the 
cities, great universities have been founded, and now taking the 
least per cent of illiteracy as a basis, this region is the most 
highly civilized portion of the globe.</p> 

<p>THE MISSOURI RIVER.</p> 

<p>The Missouri river drains a basin of 527,690 square miles. 
This, with the lower Mississippi, whose tributary it is, forms a 
river 4,200 miles in length, the longest river in the world. The 
Missouri river is formed by the confluence of the Jefferson, Gal

latin and Madison rivers at Gallatin City, Montana, 4,132 feet 
above the sea level. Of this river 2,682 feet are called navigable, 
but owing- to the shifting - sand bars, navigation is slow, and since 
the advent of the railroads, unprofitable. The river is of considerable historic interest, as it was up this waterway that the 
Lewis and Clark expedition reached the mountains, and later 
was the only means of transportation for the material and supplies for the building of the Union Pacific railroad. In 1865 
there were more than a hundred steamers in active service on 
the Missouri river, but now, in consequence of railroad competition, a steamboat plying the river past Omaha, would be looked 
upon as a curiosity.</p> 

<p>THE UNION PACIFIC IN NEBRASKA.</p> 

<p>The important part played by the Union Pacific in the 
development of the State of Nebraska cannot be estimated by any 
array of figures. The construction of the road, its rise and 
triumphs, are a part of the history of the state, and the record of 
the prosperity of the road also witnesses the growth and increasing wealth of this grand young commonwealth. Since that 
memorable day in July, 1865, when the first rail was laid, the 
Union Pacific has been a strong friend and helper to the state. 
Today the Nebraska division of -the road covers 1,245 miles of 
track—that is the main line, branches, and auxiliaries. Vast 
regions of fertile country have thus been opened up to settlers, 
and great areas of land brought by rail into close communion 
with the metropolitan centers and markets. Thriving cities, 
villages, towns and hamlets, have sprung up in every section 
traversed by the line; the state in twenty-three years has grown 
from 122,000 to over 1,250,000 inhabitants, and with a hundredfold increase in all the many sided phases of commercial, 
material, and intellectual prosperity. The beginning of this 
prosperity, this wonderful growth and progress, dates from the 
inception of the Union Pacific Railway. The men who made 
possible this work, who threw their fortunes, their health, their 
reputations into it, will one day stand in civil life like our great 
leaders in the war. Monuments to their enterprise dot the 
country between the Missouri river and the Rocky Mountains, 
between the Pacific and the Wasateh. They were the men who 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.059.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.059.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.059.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

had made possible a population within the next twenty years, 
between the Missouri river and the Pacific Coast, of fifty millions of people.</p> 

<p>The history of the Union Pacific in full would require a 
volume for the story, and in the brief -pace at our command, we 
can only outline a few of the salient features of this great 
system. Everyone knows something of its early history: how 
its construction was demonstrated to be a necessity as a war 
measure; the great achievement of the engineers who had it in 
charge, and the wonderful story of the patient, heroic effort 
which finally surmounted all obstacles and triumphed over all 
obstruction.</p> 

<p>For the building of a great railway develops incident as 
startling and romantic as can be found in the recorded pages oi 
history. The growth of the United State- west of the Alleghanies during the past fifty year.s, is due not SO much to free 
institutions, or climate, or the fertility of the soil, as to railways. 
If the institutions, and climate, and soil had not been favorable 
to the development of commonwealths, railways would not have 
been constructed: but if railways had not been invented, the 
freedom and natural advantages of our western states would 
have beckoned to human immigration and industry in vain, 
civilization would have crept slowly on in a toilsome march over 
the immense space that lie between the Appalachian ranges and 
the Pacific ocean: and what we now style the great West, would 
be, except in the valley of the Mississippi, an unknown and 
unproductive wilderness.</p> 

<p>COUNCIL BLUFFS,</p> 

<p>five miles east of Omaha, is a city of 30,000 inhabitants. While 
this city had a place on the maps since the Lewis and Clarke 
expedition, it was not until 1839 that it had a permanent population. It was in that year that a company of soldiers established 
a fort on the present site of the city. But it was not until the 
Mormons, after their expulsion from Illinois, made this thelr 
halting- place before their journey across the plains, that Council 
Bluffs became a place of importance. The emigration from the 
eastern states to the g"old fields of California added largely to

and was consequently an important outfitting point. The city

at present is one of the most beautiful in the state of Iowa. It 
has 745 acres in public parks, noted for their natural beauty and 
the additional charm of well directed and effective landscape 
gardening. Council Bluffs is also noted as a summer resort. 
Lake Manawa, the delightful haunt of pleasure seekers, enjoys 
the distinction of being the most beautiful body of water in the 
west. Grand Plaza and Manhatten Beach have become the 
resorts of outing- parties for hundreds of miles around. The 
ample hotel facilities and the hospitable spirit of its citizens have 
added greatly to its natural advantages, and its popularity in 
this respect is increasing- steadily. As a distributing point for 
agricultural implements it ranks second in the United States. It 
has a number of large manufacturing institutions, prominent 
among which are those which produce products useful for agricultural purposes. The near proximity of Council Bluffs to the 
Exposition Grounds will make it a popular stopping place for 
visitors, and will probably tax its resources to the utmost.</p> 

<p>CITY GOVERNMENT.</p> 

<p>By virtue of its population, Omaha is a City of the metropolitan class in accordance with a law passed by the last legislature. 
Under its charter of 1897 the city is divided into nine wards, from 
each of which a councilman is elected by the entire vote of the 
city by a plurality of votes. Under the same charter the following- city officers are elected to serve for three years at the specified annual salary:</p> 

<p>Mayor...$2,500</p>
<p>Police Judge...$1,200</p> 
<p>City Clerk...$1,800</p> 
<p>Treasurer...$4,000</p>
<p>Comptroller...$1,800</p> 
<p>Tax Commissioner...$2,500</p> 
<p>Nine Councilmen at...$900 each.</p> 

<p>Other city officers are appointed by the mayor and confirmed 
by the council. The revenue for meeting the expenses of the 
city is derived almost wholly from taxation. Last year the levy 
was 54 mills on an assessed valuation of $17,415,948. As the 
actual taxable property of the city is about $200,000,000. the real 
tax is less than 5 mills. </p>

<p><strong>The Police Force</strong> of the city consists at present of eightyeight men. As sixty members of the force are enrolled as patrolmen, with quick telephone connection with headquarters, so that 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.061.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.061.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.061.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the whole force can be concentrated in one place in a very short 
time, the number of men, though small, is more effective than a 
much larger body under the old methods. In the year 1896, 6,184 
arrests were made, of which 2,756 were convicted and 3,428 were 
dismissed.</p> 

<p><strong>The Fire Department</strong>, with headquarters in the City Hall, 
and with engine houses in the different portions of the city, has 
been very successful in keeping down Losses by fire. For the 
last three years the property destroyed by fire in this city has 
not averaged $100,000 per year. The department consists of the 
following companies: Pour engine companies, eight hose companies, three hook and ladder companies, and two chemical companies. This department is furnished with the most modern 
apparatus for the saving of life and preventing the destruction 
of property by fire.</p> 

<p>POPULATION.</p> 

<p>According to the United States census of 1890 the population of Omaha consisted of 140,452 souls. Of this population, 
105,413 were native bi rn and 35,039 were foreign born. The 
Caucasian race claimed 135,794, while 4,566 were colored, 89 were 
Chinese and 3 were civilized Indians. Of the foreign born the 
following countries furnished the specified numbers: Germany 
8,279, Sweden 6,265, Denmark 4.242. Ireland 4,067, Bohemia 2,675. 
England 2.455, Canada and Newfoundland 1,952, Scotland 892, 
Austria 834, Norway 624. Russia 613, Italy 536, Poland 526, 
France 244. Switzerland 208, Wales 141, Hungary 136, Holland 
125. China B9, Belgium 23, Australia 14, Turkey 13, Spain 10, 
West Indies 9, Luxemburg 8, South America 6, India 5, Greece 5, 
Pacific Islands 5. .Mexico 4, Portugal 4. Africa 5, Japan 2, Atlantic Islands 2, Central America 1. Of the 42 remaining 22 came 
from Europe and 7 from Asia—countries not specified: while 13 
were born at sea.</p> 

<p>PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.</p> 

<p>While the first settled portion of Omaha was an ideal site 
for a city, being - a gently .sloping plateau with hills in the background, the expansion of the city met with serious obstacles. 
The hills, which added so much to the beauty of the earlier city, 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.062.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.062.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.062.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

were very steep, broken and uneven, and it is impossible for the 
stranger to realize the millions of cubic yards of earth it was 
necessary to move from the hills into the ravines before the city 
was brought to its present condition. While private owners 
paid for the grading of their lots to the street level, an immense 
amount of money was expended out of the public treasury to 
bring the streets to the required grade. The site of the city hall 
was naturally forty-five feet higher than it is at present. The 
city now covers twenty-four and one-half square miles. There 
are 600 miles of streets, eighty miles of which are paved with 
stone, brick, asphalt, or cedar blocks. The blocks are now being 
replaced by other material. There is now 125 miles of sewer. 
The sewerage system is remarkable in that it is the only system 
of equal magnitude with ventilated untrapped sewers. This 
renders them free from sewer gas. Aside from the main sewers, 
about thirty miles of lateral sewers on the combination plan 
have been built. All have automatic flushing tanks at their 
terminal points and are kept constantly clear. The sewerage 
system of this city cost $1,750,000. The City Hall was completed 
a few years ago at a cost of $500,000. Aside from this the city 
has expended large sums of money on the public schools, the 
park system and the public library, each described elsewhere.</p> 

<p>WATER SUPPLY.</p> 

<p>The water furnished by the Omaha Water Company is taken 
from the Missouri river at two pumping stations, the principal 
one being located at Florence, about seven miles north of the 
city. This pumping station contains machinery capable of 
handling fifty-eight million gallons of water per twenty-four 
hours, and is divided between the high and low service. The 
low service pumps take the water from the river through intake 
pipes and deliver it into the first of a series of seven settling 
basins, having a combined storage capacity of over eighty 
million gallons. The water in passing through these basins is 
over a number of overflows so constructed as to select the upper 
and clearer film of water and repeatedly subject it to the purifying influence of aeration. The sediment contained in the river 
water, in consequence of its almost quiet state in the basins, 
settles to the bottom and is periodically discharged into the;

river through large pipes provided for that purpose. During 
this process, the basin from which the sediment is being drawn, 
is thrown out of service, emptied and thoroughly washed with 
streams of water under high pressure.</p> 

<p>From the last, and so-called clear water basin, the high service pumps take the water and force it into the distribution 
mains throughout the city, which system of pipes is in communication with a reservoir located on Walnut Hill, at an elevation of 
three hundred and seven feet above mean low water in the river, 
and having a storage capacity of eleven million gallons. The 
elevation of this reservoir, however, is not sufficiently high to 
furnish adequate pressure to the resident districts located on the 
higher portions of the bluffs, to provide which there are two 
pumping stations, with a combined pumping capacity of fourteen million gallons per twenty-four hours. One of these stations is placed at the reservoir on Walnut Hill, from which it 
receives the water and forces it to the required elevation. The 
second station, located on Twentieth street, near Poppleton 
avenue, performs a like service. Thus all the water furnished to 
the City of Omaha is pumped twice and a considerable portion of 
it three times.</p>

<p>In addition to the three pumping stations mentioned, there is 
a fourth, which is located at the river, within the city limits, at 
the foot of Burt street, and is used as an auxiliary supply station, 
ready at a moment's notice to go into operation, if required. 
This station is supplied with high and low service pumps, having 
an aggregate capacity of twenty-two million gallons for twentyfour hours, together with a system of settling basins similar in 
principle to the larger plant at Florence. It is estimated that 
the cost of this plant is approximately, five million dollars.</p> 

<p>LIBRARIES.</p> 

<p><strong>The Omaha Public Library</strong>, at the corner 19th and Harney 
streets, is one of the substantial buildings of Omaha. Architecturally speaking, the style is Italian renaissance, the superstructure is of straw colored brick, with trimmings of terra cotta of 
the same shade. The main floor is used as a stock room with 
a capacity for 130,000 volumes. The second floor contains the 
reading rooms and Byron Reed collection. The upper floor is 
arranged for an art gallery.</p>

<p>The land on which the building stands and the Reed collection of coins and manuscripts was a bequest of the late Byron 
Reed. The building- was erected at a cost of $100,000.</p> 

<p>The library was organized in 1872, with 2,600 volumes. In 
February 1878, under the law of the state, it was made a free 
public library and today numbers 53,857 volumes.</p> 

<p><strong>The New York Life Law Library</strong> occupies rooms in the Life 
buildings, corner 17th and Farnam streets. It was opened in 
October 1889 and contains 8,250 volumes.</p> 

<p><strong>The Omaha Law Library Association</strong> in the Paxton Block. 
16th and Farnam, contains 2,700 volumes.</p> 

<p><strong>Creighton College</strong>, 25th and California streets, has one of the finest college libraries in the state, having 1,600 volumes. The 
Professors' library has 7,000 volumes. To both of these libraries 
visitors will be admitted.</p> 

<p>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.</p> 

<p>It is greatly to the credit of Omaha, that during a period of 
unparalled material development, its educational institutions, in 
number and excellence, have kept equal pace. Thirty-eight 
public schools, twelve private schools and academies, and eleven 
colleges and universities, nearly all established within twenty 
years, is a record of which any community may well be proud.</p> 

<p>The foundation of this mag-nificent educational system is, of 
course, laid in the public schools of the city, which is controlled 
by a board of education of fifteen members, and enjoying the 
oversight of an active and scholarly superintendent, and conducted by a staff of devoted teachers, are maintained in the 
highest state of efficiency.</p> 

<p>In the city there are more than 30,000 school children; 17,000 
of whom were in attendance last year and 13,000 of whom were in 
attendance nearly every day during the school year. The proper 
instruction of these children requires the services of supervisors, 
principals and teachers to the number of 340. Children are 
received at the age of five years and usually spend the first year 
in the kinderg-artens, thence passing- into the regular primary 
schools. The schools are graded on the usual plan, and the child

usually passes through the grades below the High school in 
eight years. He has in this time acquired, a good common school 
education, the elements of science, of vocal music and drawing, 
and a general knowledge of English literature. After these 
grades the pupil enters the High school, where at the end of 
four years, and at an average age of 18 years, he is fitted for business life or for entrance to some college or university. The 
records of the board show that the board has in its employ more 
than 400 persons, and that it expends for their salaries and other 
purposes nearly $400,000 each year. This money comes into the 
school treasury from fines imposed and licenses granted by the 
city, from the distribution of state school funds and from local 
taxation. The amount derived from other sources has been sufficiently large so that taxation for school purposes in Omaha has 
been comparatively light. For years, as the number of pupils 
has constantly increased, the average cost of educating each 
child has as constantly decreased.</p> 

<p>The Omaha Woman's Club is a department club having a 
membership of between five and six hundred. Each of the thirteen departments has a leader, an assistant leader and a secretary, who conduct the work after the manner of advanced class 
work in school. Work in the form of topics is assigned beforehand and carefully prepared from the best sources, as in most of 
the departments no text books are used. There are departments 
for the following subjects: English history, education, art, 
domestic science, philosophy, social science, German history, 
current topics, current literature, parliamentary practice, oratory, English literature and music. The majority of these 
departments meet once in two weeks. They are subject to the 
government of the club; the various leaders with the executive 
officers making what is called the directory, which virtually 
manages the affairs of the club. It is the aim of the club, not 
only to stimulate study but as well to promote the social interests 
of its members, and further, makes it a point to identify itself 
with all advance and altruistic movements in the city. The 
general meetings of the club are held the first and second Mondays of each month from three to live o'clock. The programs 
occupying half of the time of these meetings are furnished by 
the respective departments, each department furnishing one 
program yearly. The remainder of the time is occupied by

business of a miscellaneous character. The officers for 1897 and 
1898 are: President, Mrs. W. P. Half ord; first vice president, 
Mrs. I. R. Andrews; second vice president, Mrs. W. "W. Keysor; 
treasurer, Mrs. C. Rosewater; recording- secretary, Mrs. George 
Hoobler; corresponding- secretary, Mrs. C. E. Hering. Beginning with October, the opening of the club year, the meetings 
will be held in the parlors and auditorium of the First Congregational church. Visitors are admitted in limited numbers on 
recommendation of members.</p> 

<p>Young Men's Christian Association, organized in 1868, 
erected their present building in 1887, at a cost of 5110,000. The 
membership at present numbers 1.250. The building is fitted up 
with a gymnasium, bath rooms, a library of 1,500 volumes, and 
a reading room, where may be found about 125 of the latest daily 
and weekly newspapers and magazines. There is also a room 
with implements for playing the most popular games. The 
gymnasium, containing the latest apparatus, is under the control of a physical director, who conducts his classes on scientific 
principles. Exercise is taken daily and the members are graded 
into classes according to their ability in gymnastics. The educational features of this institution are important, as its priveleges 
are not limited to members. Night schools are conducted from 
October to April and thorough courses are given in algebra, 
arithmetic, bookkeeping, parliamentary law and current topics, 
drawing, architectural, mechanical and freehand, electricity, 
elocution, English Bible, French, geography, geometry, German, Latin, penmanship, physics, political econom3', reading, 
spelling, grammar, shorthand, Spanish, steam engineering, 
t3'pewriting, telegraphy and vocal music. Men's religious 
meetings are held every Sunday at 4 p. m., and Bible classes at 
stated intervals. About 850 men make use of the privileges 
extended by this association every day. During the exposition 
open house will be kept for visiting members of all outside associations and all the privileges of the building will be extended, 
while the reading rooms will be open to all visitors whether 
members of the association or not. The building is open from 
8 a. M. to 10 P. M., and on Sunday from 1 P. M. to 6 P. M.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Hanchett's Class in History</strong>. Classes in history, 
American and foreign, have been conducted by Mrs. W. H. 
Hanchett for a number of years. Long and thorough courses 
have been given in American, English and German history, 
while three years ago Ancient Eg} r pt was taken up. The class is 
still devoting its energies to this subject. This class is open to 
any lady who wishes to take up the course of study.</p> 

<p><strong>Creighton University</strong>, founded and endowed in 1875 by 
Edward Creighton, and conducted by the order of the Jesuits, is 
entirely free. It is located on 25th and Calilornia streets and 
commands an excellent view of the surrounding country. The 
main building, a handsome brick with limestone trimmings, is 
devoted entirely to college purposes. It contains the professors' 
library, consisting of 7,000 volumes of rare and valuable books: 
the students' library of 1,600 volumes, selected for the students 
and entirely free; and a cabinet of physical apparatus, portions 
of which have been put on exhibition at various state and city 
exhibits. Aside from the main building there is an astronomical observatory, a chemical labratory, a photographic gallery, 
and a mechanical workshop.</p> 

<p><strong>John A. Creighton Medical College</strong> was founded in 1892. It 
occupies a handsome new building on the corner of 14th and 
Davenport streets, and will accommodate 400 students. The 
study of medicine in this institution consists of a four years' 
course of seven months each. The students have the benefit of 
the instruction and experience of a faculty of practical and 
experienced physicians and the advantage of attending the

<p><strong>Brownell Hall</strong>, 1512 So. Tenth street, under the control of 
the Episcopal church and. the immediate supervision of the 
bishop, and occupying- one of the pleasantest school sites in the 
city, is a boarding - school for young - ladies.</p> 

<p><strong>The Omaha Medical College</strong> was founded in 1881, and is the 
medical department of the University of Omaha. The attendance has gradually increased since its inception, and it has 
graduated many successful physicians, who are now practicing 
their profession in Omaha. The students have the advantag-e of 
attending - the hospitals in the city other than the Creighton 
Memorial St. Joseph's hospital.</p> 

<p><strong>The Academy of the Sacred Heart</strong>, located at 36th and Burt 
streets, is a boarding - school for young - ladies. While a Catholic 
school, differences of religion is no bar to admission. The 
ordinary branches are thoroughly taught, as well as long and 
complete courses in modern languages, music and painting. It 
has graduated a large number of students in the many successful years it has been in operation, and, together with the 
Brownell Hall, has drawn many young ladies from the eastern 
states to enjoy its educational advantages.</p> 

<p><strong>Belleview College</strong>, nine miles south of Omaha, and the theological seminary of this city; also parts of the University of 
Omaha are enjoying a large attendance.</p> 

<p>ART IN OMAHA.</p> 

<p>The period of greatest interest and activity in art in Omaha, 
when the art interests were united, and sincerely seeking a 
higher plan of knowledge and expression, were those years 
when the Western Art Association, under the able guidance of 
its president, Mr. G. W. Lininger, held its popular exhibitions 
and awarded its prizes and medals to the successful artists.</p> 

<p>The first fall exhibition of the association was held in 1888 
in the splendid gallery built by Mr. Ljninger, in connection with 
his residence at Eighteenth and Davenport streets, for the 
valuable collection of works of art he had secured in his travels 
around the world. This collection of paintings is on free exhibition to the public, and thousands of visitors avail themselves of 
the delightful privileges extended to them.</p>

<p>The gallery contains many choice and valuable pictures, 
representing both the modern men and the old masters. There 
are some marbles of purity and beauty, and rare antique vases 
and curios that it would be difficult to rival, and in many cases 
impossible to duplicate. In this lovely home of art, the Western 
Art Association held its monthly meetings, and listened to abie 
lectures by members of the association and invited guests from 
abroad.</p> 

<p>Previous to the organization of the Western Art Association, there had been several clubs formed for the advancement 
of art culture and feeling in Omaha. The first was twenty 
years ago, when art in Omaha was void and without form. It 
was in 1877 when Mrs. C. F. Catlin organized a sketch class, which 
did pioneer work, until the ladies of Trinity church formed 
another club in 1879. which was succeeded in 1881 by the "Social 
Art Club of Omaha."</p> 

<p>These were the first stars to shine in the firmament of art in 
Omaha, and they continued to illumine the art skies until the 
sun of the Western Art Association rose above the horizon.</p> 

<p>When the association was at its zenith, it started an art 
school with casts and models, a north light and all the equipments of modern times. This was under the direction of J. 
Laurie Wallace. The school was finally closed, owing to the 
business depression that made its financial success impossible.</p> 

<p>About this time the Omaha Sketch club was formed with a 
score of male artists and students enrolled as members. It also 
had a fine assortment of casts and bric-a-brac. Its evenings 
were spent in drawing from the living model. Its officers were: 
Albert Rothery, president; M. M. Henninger, vice president; 
Mark A. Pollock, treasurer, and J. W. Bennett, secretary.</p> 

<p>These men finally scattered to different parts of the world, 
in pursuit of further art knowledge, and the sketch club, after 
dividing its casts and bric-a-brac among the members, became 
a thing of the memory only.</p> 

<p>In addition to Mr. Laninger's gallery- of art, there are many 
fine private collections of art works, that are beautiful and 
costly.</p> 

<p>Judge J. M. Woolworth has a collection that contains works 
by Herring, Corot, Rousseau, and others.</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. N. Patrick also has a fine collection, which includes 
works by the Dupres, George Inness, William Hart, Bierstadt, 
and others.</p> 

<p>Herman Kountze, and many others of our wealthy citizens 
have private collections of paintings that are worth)- of extended 
mention.</p> 

<p>In the outskirts of the city, near Florence, Mr. Fred Parker 
has a large studio built for his private use, and also owns a collection of paintings. He is a man of wealth, and will undoubtedly 
add to those he now possesses.</p> 

<p>Among the Omaha artists who are meeting with deserved 
success, are J. Laurie Wallace, whose studio is in the Williams 
building, Fifteenth and Dodge; Albert Rothery, who was 
awarded the Western Art Association gold medal, whose studio 
is in the U. S. Bank building-, Twelfth and Farnam streets; J. K. 
O'Neill, who is in the Sheeley Block; Miss Fannie Snowden and 
Mrs. Francis Mumaugh, who make flowers and still life a 
specialty, and who, with Mrs. Fannie Bachman, china painter, 
are in the Paxton Block; Miss Melona Butterfield, ceramic painter, and who was awarded the g-old medal for the best china 
painting by the Western Art Association, also two World's Fair 
medals, and whose pleasant studio is in the New York Life 
building.</p> 

<p>This is a brief synopsis of the art of Omaha to date. The 
city is filled with amateurs and connoisseurs, and all are looking 
forward with joy and expectancy to the opening- of the Art 
Palace of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, which will be under 
the directorship of Mr. J. H. Griffith, of the Detroit Museum of 
Art, who is eminently fitted for the position, and who will 
undoubtedly make of the occasion the greatest exhibition of 
works of art ever seen in the west.</p> 

<p>AMUSEMENTS.</p> 

<p>Aside from the usual round of social g-aities common to all of 
our western cities, the theaters form the chief diversion of 
Omaha people during- the winter. From the opening of the 
theatrical season early in Septemoer until the close in June, the 
two principal theaters supply a variety of attractions, ranging 
from heavy drama and grand opera, to cheap burlesque and farce 
comedy. During the summer months light opera or a popular

price dramatic company holds the boards at one of the theaters, 
thus affording continuous diversion to theater goers.</p> 

<p>Athletic sports are the staple amusement of the younger 
part of the population during the summer, and baseball, bicycling, 
football, tennis and golf each has its hundreds of stories, and 
numerous clubs help to maintain the interest in each. The Y. M. 
C. A. gymnasium affords ample opportunities to those who find 
pleasure in the use of apparatus for indoor exercise Those fond 
of swimming and boating will find facilities for the exercise of 
these sports at Lake Manawa, three miles south of Council 
Bluffs, and Courtland Beach in East Omaha. Each of these 
lakes is fitted up with every appliance for furthering the sports, 
and during the entire season some kind of vaudeville entertainment is offered for the amusement of the guests.</p> 

<p>Music is by no means a lost art in Omaha, for aside from the 
fine music furnished by the churches, and the regular open air 
band concerts, through the instrumentality of the various musical societies, the people are enabled to hear the best traveling 
artists in this county.</p>

directions loaded down with merrymakers for a day's outing- in 
some of the chosen groves in the vicinity. Smaller parties find 
numerous grounds nearer home, supplied with all things necessary to make these gatherings a pleasant success. Fairmount park 
and L,ake Manawa, while lying on the Iowa side of the river, are 
easily accessible to Omaha pleasure seekers. Courtland Beach, 
to which motors run from the city every ten minutes, surrounds 
a natural lake of beautiful water, to which has been added a neat 
little pavillion, bathing and boating conveniences, a menagerie 
and. switch back railway. Pries lake, seven miles north of the 
city and the various public parks are convenient and suitable 
places for the purpose.</p> 

<p>CLUBS.</p> 

<p><strong>The Omaha Club</strong> is the oldest now existing in the city. It is 
a purely social organization, which numbers among its members 
many of the substantial business men of Omaha. A few years 
ago they completed a very handsome white stone club house, on 
the corner of Twentieth and Douglas streets, at a cost of about 
$200,000. The next most important of the large clubs is the 
Metropolitan, a Jewish club, also formed, for social purposes, and 
the owner of a fine club building on Harney street. The members of the Woman's club, elsewhere mentioned, are contemplating the erection of a building of their own. Athletic clubs, 
bicycle clubs, literary clubs, and clubs of travel, of sculpture, of 
painting, and of ceramics, each have a large list of enthusiastic 
members.</p> 

<p><strong>The Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben</strong> is a semi-social and semi-business organization. It was formed for the purpose of affording 
evening entertainment for the strangers who visit Omaha during the State Fair. For several evenings they give an electrical display with parades, which attract visitors from all over the 
west, and close the fete with a grand ball, which is the social 
event of the season. This organization, aside from its primary 
object of attracting visitors to the fair, has done more to unite 
the business interests of the city and to awaken popular enthusiasm in public undertakings than any other agency. To them 
is due to a great extent the credit of making the exposition possible.</p>

<p><strong>The Commercial Club</strong>, as its name implies, is an organiza 
tion formed by the business and professional men of the city, to 
further the commercial interests of Omaha. Its building, on the 
corner of Sixteenth and Farnam streets, contains the offices and 
halls of the club and the reception rooms for the entertainment 
of the guests of the city. The use of the halls is free to any 
association organized to promote the welfare of the city. The 
club has been especially active and successful in securing better 
transportation and insurance rates; in inducing outside capitalists to invest in Omaha enterprises; in opening up new territory 
to the Omaha jobbing trade, and finding new outlets for its 
manufactured products. During the past year it has exerted 
every effort to further the success of the exposition. The work 
has been mostly along the lines of securing a great attendance. 
1 hrough its efforts the greatest number of important conventions ever held in any city in the United States in a single year 
will be held in Omaha during the exposition.</p> 

<p>LODGES AND SOCIETIES.</p> 

<p>Omaha is abundantly supplied with secret, beneficiary and 
social lodges and societies. Every association of any prominence 
in the United States is represented in Omaha. Her best citizens 
are members, active in their welfare and heavy contributors to 
their maintenance. Omaha is considered the fountain head in 
the northwest for fraternal news and advance thought along 
these lines. She is the home of many fraternal public speakers; 
headquarters of the Woodmen of the World, one of the largest 
beneficiary orders in the country, also the headquarters of 
the Knights of the Forest, are located in Omaha, the place 
of their birth; the Fraternal Union of America is a semiOmaha institution and its entire organization forces, consisting 
of seventy-five deputies, at work in thirty states, are, managed 
from Omaha. Other smaller institutions have headquarters in 
this city, some of which may yet develop into large permanent 
organizations, and thus contribute to the importance of Omaha 
as a great center of western fraternal interests. All information as to the different orders established here, with time and 
place of their meetings, may be found in the city directory. The 
list covers about eight pages of that volume.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT BUILDING.</p> 

<p>The new government building, now nearing completion, has 
taken six years in construction. The site covers one block and 
was bought at a cost of $400,000. The dimensions of the structure are 135x218 feet, and the apex of the tower is 200 feet above 
the ground. It is, of course, entirely fire proof, being constructed 
of Colorado granite, with tile floors on steel frames. It consists 
of four stories and a basement. The first floor and the basement 
will be utilized by the postoffice department. The second floor 
will be occupied by the surveyor of customs, the collector of 
internal revenue, the railway mail service and the secret service. 
The third floor contains two large court rooms, offices for the 
federal judge, the clerk of the court, the district attorney and the 
United States marshal. On the fourth floor will be found the 
United States weather bureau and the jury rooms. The tower 
will contain one of the largest clocks in the country, the diaJ 
measuring twelve feet in diameter. The cost of the building is 
$1,000,000, making a total cost of $1,400,000. One of the interesting features to visitors is the glass mosaic ceiling of the vestibule, done at a cost of about $16,000. This is the first work of the 
kind attempted in the west, and is the special feature, which has 
added so much to the beauty of the great library buildings 
of Boston and Chicago and the library of congress at "Washington.</p> 

<p>SIGNAL SERVICE.</p> 

<p>Omaha is one of the points selected by the general government for the establishment of a Weather Bureau. L. A. Welch 
is in charge and under his management the people of this vicinity 
are becoming alive to the practical value of this service. The 
object of this service generally is to make forecasts of the 
weather from 24 to 36 hours in advance for the practical value of 
this knowledge as bearing upon agriculture and commerce. 
These observations are made from all points in the United States 
at precisely the same time, 8 o'clock A. M., 75th meridian time. 
These observations consist of: Noting the barometer reduced 
to sea level, temperature of the air, dew-point of the air, relative 
humidity, direction and velocity of the wind, state of the weather, 
kind of clouds—upper and lower, movement of clouds, and

is immediately placed upon the circuit in cipher and reaches 
almost simultaneously all the different stations in the country 
where the information is of value, as bearing- on their forecasts, 
and the main western office at Chicago and the chief office at 
Washington. As the reports of the whole west reach Chicago 
at almost the same time, forecasts are at once made up and telegraphed to all western offices, whence they are sent to all postmasters in country town.-, and there displayed by flags and 
bulletins. This news is generally widespread by 9 A. M. local 
time. The peculiar conditions of the climate in this section 
makes it unnecessary to take into account the conditions to the 
east. All forecasts are therefore made from observations taken 
here and to the west. The local office distributes 300 weather 
makes daily in and about Omaha and sends out by mail about 400 
weather forecast cards, which are delivered by carrier in the 
morning.</p> 

<p>NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.</p> 

<p>The newspapers of thecity have always worked harmoniously 
for the advancement of the city and the development of the west. 
To them, more than any other agency, is due the credit of proposing the Exposition and carrying it to a successful issue. 
There are six daily and thirty weekly, tri-weekly and monthly 
newspapers published in Omaha. There are two great daily 
papers in the English language. That two are enough to meet 
all requirements, is explained by the fact, that both issue morning and evening editions, with sometimes hourly specials, when 
the public interest demands.</p> 

<p><strong>The Omaha Bee</strong>, founded and controlled by E. Rosewater, 
has played a prominent part in the history of the west. From a 
very small beginning it has developed into one of the most farreaching and influential journals of the western half of the 
country. Its one-roomed office of twenty years ago has been 
transformed into one of the largest, most substantial, and most 
perfectly appointed newspaper buildings in the world. In politics the Bee is independent, but generally, especially on national 
questions, leans strongly to republicanism. The keen, incisive 
editorials in which the Bee has discussed all public questions, 
has given the paper an individuality of its own, and whatever 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.088.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.088.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.088.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

difference of opinion may exist as to its methods in conducting a 
campaign, there is never any doubt as to which side of the question it espouses. To Mr. Rosewater belongs the credit of first 
proposing the Exposition, and as manager of the department of 
publicity and promotion and as editor of the Bee he has labored 
untiringly for its success.</p> 

<p><strong>The World-Herald</strong>, as its name indicates, was founded by 
the consolidation of the World and the Herald. Gilbert M. 
Hitchcock has controlled -the paper from the first. Mr. Hitchcock, until his resignation, was an influential member of the 
executive committee of the Exposition directory and was manager 
of the department of promotion. His exertions were especially 
directed toward securing the mobilization of the troops of the regular army and the National Guards at Omaha during the Exposition. In politics the World-Herald is independent, but has been 
an earnest champion of free silver. It is working for the fusion of 
the populists with the free silver wing of the democratic party, 
and was the official organ of the Hon. W. J. Bryan in the late 
presidential campaign.</p> 

<p>BANKS AND BANKING.</p> 

<p>There are eight national banks doing business in Omaha and 
three in South Omaha. The combined paid up capital of these 
banks is $4,150,000. On October 1, 1897, they had deposits to the 
extent of 819.050,208. On the same date their reports sent to the 
comptroller of the treasury showed their resources to be $24,713,457. The majority of these banks are controlled and officered 
by men who have grown with the city, and the conservative manner in which this business is conducted, is a guarantee to the 
depositors, that the banks of Omaha are entirely safe. That 
business is improving in Omaha, is best shown by the reports of 
the clearing house. It must be remembered that the three banks 
of South Omaha are not members of the Omaha Clearing House 
Association, and that therefore the immense live stock transactions, which take place daily, are not included in this report.</p>

<p>REAL ESTATE.</p> 

<p>Money has been made in real estate investments in Omaha. 
Money can be made again is being made now—in Omaha realty. 
There have been losses in this class of investments in Omaha, 
it must be admitted. So has there been depreciation in value in 
real estate holdings in all cities, and in farm property as well. 
tea in the past ten years have not been con lined to those 
met in real estate, however; stocks in banks, railroads, manufacturing- enterprises, mines, have all broken in value under the strain of the past decade. But shrewd men do not stop putting 
their money into investments because other men under unfavorable circumstances or through mistaken judgment have met 
loss in the same lines. So it is that the wise and far sighted 
investor will see in Omaha an attractive opening for dealing 
profitably in real estate. This for several reasons:</p>

<p>First, in the western city that is established as a business 
center for a large, fertile and constantly improving section of 
country, as is Omaha, it is always a certainty that real estate 
values will advance as the population increases and business 
expands. This is especially true of Omaha, one of the great 
gateways to the vast Trans-Missouri region, with its rapidly 
growing population, a region having products and importance 
sufficient to support its metropolis.</p> 

<p>Second, during the prevalence of that remarkable business 
movement known as the "real estate boom of the '8O's," there 
was not in Omaha the wild speculation, and crazy buying 
and selling at fabulous prices that existed in nearly every other 
city of this class. Choice inside business property and the best 
located residence property, never attained the high figure 
reached elsewhere. There are g-ood reasons for this fact, which 
space prevents mentioning- here. It is also a fact that in the 
past few years of terrible depression, caused by panic and drouth 
in cruel succession, values of well situated property have not 
been reduced much below the figures of the boom days.</p> 

<p>A third reason why Omaha's real estate interests are worth 
considering at the present time by the investor, is the fact that 
the purchaser now gets the benefit of special improvements paid 
for by the late owners. Grading, paving, sewer and sidewalk 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.090.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.090.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.090.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

taxes have all been a severe drain on real estate owners in the 
past ten years. He who buys now, will, in most cases, be 
relieved of this burden, and yet will have all the benefit of these 
improvements.</p> 

<p>The foundation of the fortunes of nearly every one of 
Omaha's wealthy citizens has been laid in real estate. There 
seems to be no good reason why that which has been accomplished in the past ten or twelve years by judicious investment 
in Omaha real estate, may not be accomplished in the next ten 
or twelve years. Certainly there were never more tempting 
opportunities in that line, coupled with surer values, and more 
probable remunerative returns, than are those offered today in 
Omaha to the careful dealer in real estate.</p> 

<p>RETAIL BUSINESS.</p> 

<p>The retail trade of Omaha is one of the most important 
features in her mercantile operations. There are more than 
1,600 individual firms engag-ed in the retail trade in Omaha, and 
whilst other cities may boast of a greater amount of capital 
invested in this branch of trade, the merchants of very few of 
them have passed through the late depression and are able to 
make as good a showing as can the retail merchants of Omaha.</p> 

<p>Failures in business among them have been few and unimportant, whilst the evidences of growth have been apparent in 
spite of adverse conditions. Very few chang-es have taken place, 
and nearly all who were in business before the hard times began, 
are keeping store at the old stand, and today are better equipped 
for business than ever before.</p> 

<p>About two years ago, the retailers of Omaha, believing that 
organized effort could accomplish more than individual work, 
organized the Omaha Retailers Association. This organization 
began active operations by directing its efforts toward the lowering of the then excessive rates charged for fire insurance. This 
was a popular movement and enlisted the united support of all 
retail merchants and property owners. This effort was so successful that a ten per cent reduction was secured on all business 
risks, and twenty per cent reduction on residence property and 
contents, and the end is not yet.</p>

<p>The association next addressed itself to the securing of better 
depot facilities for the city of Omaha, and while it has not yet 
secured the Union Depot for which it has striven so hard, this 
improvement is nearer to the city than it ever has been before, 
and the fact that a depot building is now being built for the city 
is due in a large measure to the efforts of the Omaha Retailers 
Association.</p> 

<p>Among the things which the Omaha Retailers Association, 
uid the retail merchants in general, hope to secure in the future, 
ire better collection Laws, the regulation of transient tradesmen 
rod fake dealers by a properlj adjusted License system, and 
various other reforms, which will especially help the retail 
dealers, and the public at large.</p> 

<p>Never has there been a period when the retail dealers 
Omaha have so earnestly considered plans for bettering trade, 
and business in general, as at the present. They have most 
Liberally contributed of their means to every enterprise which 
ass been for the best interests of their city. They have shown 
heir patriotism to their home city and to their state, and to the 
krhole west by their loyal support of the Trans-Mississippi and 
International Exposition.</p> 

<p>WHOLESALE INTERESTS.</p> 

<p>As the railroad facilities of Omaha arc unsurpassed by am 
city west of the Mississippi river, and a^ its Location makes it 
the natural depot of supplies for the great agricultural, mining 
and stock raising regions of the west, it follows as a matter of 
curse that Omaha has built up great jobbing interests. There 
are about 250 firms, Large and small, engaged in the wholesale 
business in this city. They have a capital invested of fully 
$10,000,000, and their annual sales range from $40,000,000 to 
$60,000,000. The number of employes of all kinds engaged in 
liis business is about 5,000. There are about 2,000 commercial 
travelers resident in this city, who make periodical trips over 
their territory. The territory covered by these men collectively, 
extends from the Missouri river to the Coast, and from the 
British possessions to the Gulf, with the states of Iowa and 
issouri included. As the wholesale firms of Omaha meet all 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.094.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.094.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.094.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

the requirements of a highly civilized, people engaged in industries widely diverging- all the different lines of merchandise are 
represented in this city. In each of the more important lines 
there are several houses which employ from ten to twenty-five 
traveling salesmen each. The most important lines are agricultural implements, groceries, boots and shoes, dry goods, hardware, 
drugs, furniture, clothing, hats and caps, lumber, coal, rubber 
goods, paper, books and stationery, liquors, cigars and tobacco, 
fish and oysters, paint and glass, jewelry, toys and fancy goods, 
photographic supplies, stoves and ranges, seeds, surgical 
instruments, and many less important lines. Omaha has for 
some years been a port of entr3', and as importations from 
foreign countries are received here in bond, the delay and 
expense of clearing at a border port is avoided. Omaha ranks 
seventh among the interior districts in point of collections. As 
in point of population che settlement of this territory has barely 
begun, the wholesale firms of Omaha must steadily increase in 
number and importance.</p> 

<p>MANUFACTURING.</p> 

<p>Until comparatively recent years the people of Omaha and 
the west generally have been dependent upon the east for all
manufactured products. But recently great changes have been 
taking place. On account of its situation in relacion to the great 
mining, stock raising, and agricultural states of the west, great 
factories have sprung up which equal, if they do not surpass 
anything of like kind in the world. With them, and dependent 
upon them, others have entered the field. While the development of the great coal mines of the mountain states is making it 
possible and profitable for all kinds of manufacturing to be carried on here successfully. Few even of the residents of the city
are aware of the extent of the manufacturing interests now 
established. A careful investigation shows that all claims even 
made by this city are far too low. There are in this city today 
more than 200 industrial establishments, furnishing employ 
ment to at least 15,000 men, with an invested capital of about
$35,000,000. The value of the annual total output of these establishments will exceed $100,000,000. In fact, it is extremely probable, that the packing houses alone within the next few years 
will exceed that sum.</p>

<p><strong>The packing houses</strong> are the greatest of Omaha's manufacturing plants. Their annual distributive sales amount to more 
than if 60, 000, 000. The number of men on their pay-rolls is 7,150, 
and they collectively draw a salary of a trifle over $3,500,000 
annually. The capital invested in the five plants will exceed 
110,000,000. Thirteen years ago the site of these immense buildings 
was a farm surrounded by other farms, lying four miles from the 
city. From the nature of their products it is certain that these 
institutions will grow in the future as they have in the past. 
With the great plant of Armour in operation, the competition 
between the buyers will become more keen with a tendency to 
higher prices which will attract shipments from a wider radius, 
while with the development of the farm lands of the western 
states, the conversion of the ranges into cornfields and tame 
grass pastures, the production of stock of a better grade will be 
increased tenfold. The business of this year shows an increase 
over that of last of about twenty-five per cent. More than ninety 
per cent of the stock received at the yards is slaughtered here.</p> 

<p>While the killing of cattle and hog-s and their transformation 
into pork and beef is not a particularly elevating sight, the 
immensity of these institutions and the skill and celerity with 
which this work is accomplished, attracts many visitors. Thel 
stock yards are open to all visitors, but to go through the packing houses a pass is necessary. This can be obtained without 
difficulty by applying at the office. It would be a pleasure to 
give a description of all the enormous plants operated at South 
Omaha by the Armour, Swift, Cudahy, Hammond, and Omaha 
companies, but the lack of space forbids. We therefore select
for our purpose the Cudahy Packing Co., which by reason of its 
volume of business and the great variety of its products, makes 
it representative of them all. The history of this concern shows 
a rapid and continuous growth from its beginning and furnishes: 
a fine example of what zeal, energy and business sagacity will 
accomplish. During the decade which marks its existence, 
has developed until now under the one corporate name, nearb 
a score of different kinds of manufacturing are carried on. Aside 
from the usual slaughtering- and curing departments, there are 
separate and complete factories for making soaps, commercial 
fertilizers, oleo oil, neutral lard, buttcrine, glue, beef extract 
pepsin and other pharmaceutical preparations. The company

also has its own extensive car, machine, blacksmith, cooperage 
and tin shops, box factory, refrigerator and tank car lines. This 
company has representatives and does business in every state in 
the Union and in addition sells every year products worth millions to various portions of Europe, Mexico, Canada, South 
America, Japan, China, etc. Its special brands, "Rex" and 
"Diamond C," have become the recognized standards of excellence wherever introduced, which accounts for the company's wonderful hold on its almost numberless patrons. The soap works, 
seven stories high and fitted with the most modern and complete 
appliances, are the latest addition to this great institution.</p>  

<p>The plant of this gigantic company covers a ground area of 
twenty-five acres and a floor space of nearly eighty acres. The 
aggregate sales are more than twenty-five millions of dollars 
annually or an average of $80,000 for every single business day. 
Its outbound products and incoming supplies fill nearly 100 cars 
daily. And this is only one of the five great packing concerns of 
which South Omaha boasts. If the pace of the past ten years 
continues, the early part of the next century may see concentrated here the most extensive live stock and packing interests 
known to mankind.</p> 

<p><strong>The Smelting Works</strong>. The business of the Omaha and 
Grant Smelting Co. has reached such proportions as to make the 
operation of its great plant in Omaha one of the most conspicuous factors in the city's industrial activity. The history of the 
company's development, if written in full, would be a tolerably 
respectable story of the marvelous growth of smelting and mining operations in the western mineral regions. As long ago as 
1870, so the record goes, the Omaha Smelting and Refining Co. 
was organized with a capital stock of $60,000. W. W. Lowe, John 
A. Haroach and E. W. Nash were prominentl) r connected with 
the organization, the latter being its secretary. Later, Leopold 
Balbach, C. B. Rustin, Charles W. Meade and others became identified with the company, and Charles Balbach was for a long time 
its general superintendent. In 1882 the company was reorganized 
and consolidated with the Grant Smelting Company of Denver, 
Colo. The capital stock was increased to $2,500,000, the name of 
the company changed to the Omaha and Grant Smelting Co. and 
Guy C. Barton, a new and influential member, was elected

president, with J. B. Grant of Denver, vice president, E.W. Nash, 
who had been prominently identified with the business from the 
beginning-, secretary and treasurer,. Edward Eddy, general manager and W. H. James, superintendent. Since that time, under 
the wise direction of the present general officers and the co-operation of their local superintendents the operations of the company have greatly expanded, until its position at the head of like 
institutions is generally conceded. In addition to its extensive 
works in Omaha and Denver this company controls and operates 
the line plant of the San Juan Smelting and Mining Co. at Durango, Col., and has important interests in British Columbia. The 
principal office of the company is in Omaha, where President 
Barton and Secretary Nash reside. The Omaha works include 
an extensive roasting and smelting department, the refinery, and 
a complete blue stone plant. Base bullion from Denver, Durango, Salt Eake City and Clayton, Idaho; rich gold and copper 
mattes from the Black Hills smelters and Trail Creek, British 
Columbia; cyanides from the extensive Mercur district, Utah, 
and great quantities of furnace and mill products from other 
localities are refined in Omaha, so that the total output of precious 
metals and baser products run well iuto the millions. A better 
idea of these items can be gotten from the following approximate 
figures for 1897: Gold, 325.000 ounces; silver, 12.750,000 ounces 
lead, 79,550,000 pounds; copper, 2,660,000 pounds; blue vitriol. 
7,259,000 pounds. The approximate value of this year's output 
will be $18,000,000. From 500 to 700 men are employed at the 
Omaha works, and the pay-roll averages about $30,000 per month.</p> 

<p><strong>Carter White Lead Works</strong> is one of Omaha's largest manufacturing institutions, and on account of the nature of its product, has been operated here successfully. Being situated in the 
center of the flax producing country and at the same point with 
the largest smelter and linseed oil mill in the west, it is enabled 
to manufacture successfully the highest grade of white lead on 
the market. Another plant by the same company has been
recently established in Chicago. The combined capacity of the
two plants is 30.000 tons, and is the largest white lead manufacturing institution in the world. All the stock is owned by Omaha 
capitalists; $1,000,000 is invested, and the annual output amounts 
to over $3,000,000. Employment is furnished to about 200 men 
In addition to these two large factories, branch warehouses are

Buffalo, .St. Paul, Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
New Orleans. Boston and San Francisco.</p> 

<p><strong>The Woodman Linseed Oil Works</strong>, the largest in the Trans-Mississippi country, is one of the oldest manufacturing institutions in Omaha, having been in continuous operation since 1S72. 
During that time it has manufactured over 5.000,000 bushels of 
flaxseed into linseed oil and linseed oil cake. The process of 
manufacturing at these works is called the old process, because 
the oil is extracted from the seed by hydraulic pressure, which is 
theoldest and only mean.-, of producing oil without contamination with chemical liquids, that not only produce an inferior 
quality, but renders the oil impure. In connection with the mill 
r is one of the largest elevators in Omaha, with a capacity 
of 800,000 bushels of flaxseed, while several large tanks have a 
capacity of 500,000 gallons of linseed oil. Within the next few 
months new and improved machinery will be added, which will 
not only increase the capacity of the works, but will largely 
increase the number of men employed.</p> 

<p><strong>Sugar Beet Factories</strong>. With the assured success of the cultivation of the sugar beet in this and surrounding states, the 
establishment of factories for the purpose of manufacturing 
sugar has become a necessity. The actual experience of several 
years cultivation shows that this product can be produced in 
this vicinity with a saccharine strength almost double that of 
the Old World. To meet the requirements of this new industry, 
a great beet sugar and glucose plant will be constructed in South 
Omaha during the exposition year. Another of perhaps still 
greater proportions will be built in East Omaha. The location 
of Omaha in the midst of this district makes it the natural 
center for such manufacture and the next decade will probably 
see dozens of factories in full operation here with a capacity 
equal to supplying the markets of this country.</p> 

<p><strong>The Breweries</strong>. Omaha has four large breweries, the output of which is largely taking the place in the western states of 
the beer which had been formerly shipped here from Milwaukee 
and St. Louis. The amount invested in these breweries is about 
$1,750,000; the annual capacity about 375,000 barrels. The number of men employed is about 150.</p>

<p><strong>The Willow Springs Distillery</strong> is one of the most perfectly 
appointed plants of the kind in the world. The finished quality 
of its products has created a general demand and the plant is 
consequently generally run to its full capacity. This is about 
3,000 bushels per day or slightly over a million per year. In 
connection with the distillery, an important cattle feeding- plant 
is maintained and about 3,000 head of cattle are required to prevent waste. There are about 175 men engaged in the work 
proper, the cooper shop and the care of the cattle.</p> 

<p><strong>The Firm of Farrell &amp; Co.</strong> has been engaged for a number 
of years in the manufacture of syrups, molasses, jellies and preserves, baking powder, and a number of other articles. They 
are also extensively engaged in the manufacture of tinware. 
This firm has been very successful and has built up a stead}trade, which covers the whole Trans-Mississippi country.</p> 

<p><strong>The National Oil and Paint Co.</strong> of this city manufactures 
all the kinds of paint known to the trade. They cover, with 
their traveling salesmen, nine of the surrounding states.</p> 

<p>It is impossible in a book of this nature to give an adequate 
description of the various industrial institutions located here, 
and we must be content to name some of the most important. 
There are more than a thousand men engaged in the working of 
iron, in the manufacture of structural iron, boilers, engines, 
locomotives, and agricultural implements. Three clothing manufacturing firms, with an invested capital of $1,000,000 give work 
to nearly a thousand employes. The Bemis Omaha Bag Company supply the grain and flour trade of the west with the product of their factory. There are twenty different cigar factories • 
in the city employing each from four to thirty men. There are a 
number of printing houses and blank book manufacturers. There 
are three large confectionary establishments. There are aside 
from those already named, from one to five firms engaged in the 
manufacture of each of the following articles: Baking powder 
and extracts, envelopes, boxes, brick, brooms, pearl buttons, 
carriages and wagons, sash, doors and blinds, health food, 
corsets, crackers, steam pumps, saddles and harness, horse 
collars, tinware, lead and shot, marble and granite works, 
mirrors, flour, patterns and models, pickles, vinegar and mustard,

<p>THE STOCK YARDS.</p> 

<p>The present site of South Omaha was thirteen years ago 
nothing but farm and pasture land. Today it is one of the three 
greatest live stock markets in the world, and at the present rate 
of growth will soon be second, if not finally first. Five great 
packing houses, with other industries incident to a live stock 
market, have built up a city of over 15,000 inhabitants, which is 
probably the most bustling, thriving and substantial city of its 
size in the world.</p> 

<p>The cause of the phenomenal growth of this great industry 
is found in the fact, that Omaha is situated in the midst of the 
great corn belt and to the east of the great stock ranges. 
which extend from the British possessions to Mexico and the 
Gulf. Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Missouri, the four great corn 
producing states, surround this common center, and find a 
market here for their finished stock, while at the same time it is 
the nearest market to the ranges of Montana. Washington. Oregon, Idaho. Utah, Colorado, Nevada, the Dakotas. "Wyoming and 
Indian Territory, which furnishes an inexhaustible supply of 
both cattle and sheep to be either slaughtered here, if in condition, or to be fitted for the block by feeders in this corn belt. 
These reasons, with the perfect railroad facilities and the great 
packers established here.—Cudahy, Swift. Hammond. Armour 
and the Omaha Packing Co..—guarantee that the importance of 
this market can but increase with time.</p> 

<p>The present capacity of the yards is estimated at 620 cars of 
cattle, 15,000 head; 375 cars of hogs, 25.000 head, 70 double decks 
of sheep, 15.000 head, and 50 cars of horses. 1,000 head. About 80 
acres are now covered with pens, barns, sheds, and other buildings necessary for carrying on the business, while other land is 
being graded, to be used for the same purpose. The shedding, 
drainage and water service is perfect and quick transportation is 
arranged for by a network of tracks and switches. The cattle 
sold on this market in 1897 numbered 825.689 and brought

<p>PARKS AND BOULEVARDS.</p> 

<p>While the park board of Omaha, as at present constituted, is 
of comparatively recent origin, its work has been of incalculable 
value to the future of the city. A chain of parks, selected for 
their location and natural adaptability, now surrounds the city 
and are to be connected by a system of magnificent boulevards, 
a part of which is already completed. The principal objection 
to the location of the parks at the time of their selection was 
that they were too far from the heart of the city, but the desirability of residence in their vicinity and the gradual expansion of 
the city have brought them well within the limits. There are 
now eight parks aggregating 543 1/2 acres and valued at more 
than a million and a half.</p> 

<p><strong>Hanscom Park</strong>, the best known and most popular, lies in the 
southwestern part of the city and contains 57 1/2 acres. It was 
donated to the city by two of the pioneer citizens, Mr. A. J. 
Hanscom and Mr. J. G. Megeath. This park possessed great 
natural advantages which have been richly supplemented bv the 
artisan's skill. New roadways, bridlepaths, walks and entrances 
were made, and considerable grading done. Two lakes were 
provided at the south side, water being provided by the city 
waterworks. Both lakes are well stocked with fish that furnish 
amusement to the children who take delight in watching and 
feeding them during the summer season. In the winter both 
lakes are kept in good condition for skating, and this popular 
amusement attracts hundreds of people daily. A large greenhouse is maintained on the grounds, besides a pavillion where 
refreshments are served and a music stand for concert purposes.

The high order of the band concerts, which are given every Sunday during the summer months, are highly appreciated and 
attract immense crowds. The Hanscom park and North 24th 
street motor line goes directly to the park.</p> 

<p><strong>Elmwood Park</strong>, containing 215 acres, lies on the west side of the city. By a donation of Mr. Lyman Richardson, Mr. Leopold 
Doll, Mr. John T. Bell, and others, this park, containing 50 acres 
and located three and one-half miles west of the postoffice, became a part of the park system in 1890. Considerable money has 
been expended in improving- this park, which is a beautiful piece 
of ground for park purposes, being- partially covered with a 
growth of natural trees, among- which are some very valuable 
elms. A brook of pure spring- water runs through the park, 
furnishing- clear water for several lakes or pools at intervals 
along the ravine. The immediate surroundings embrace a 
variety of elevations valuable to a park of large proportions and 
when the board was selecting sites for parks, they recognized in 
this little park the nucleus for the main park of the city, and 
therefore the surroundings were acquired by purchase, $135,000 
being paid for an additional 160 acres, enlargiug the park to 
215 acres.</p> 

<p><strong>Fontanelle Park</strong>, containing 110 acres and located three and one-half miles northwest of the postoffice, was purchased for 
$90,000. Over 6,000 trees have been planted and cared for. but 
as yet little has been done toward the permanent inprovement 
of the park.</p> 

<p><strong>Miller Park</strong>. This eighty-acre tract, situated in the extreme north part within the city limits, was purchased for $75,000 at 
the same time that the other park purchases were made. It has 
a rolling surface in the center of which is a large depression 
providing a natural place for a lake of about eight acres. The 
building of the roads and surfacing generally has been completed, excavation for the lake has been made, dam and spillway 
built and about 5,000 trees planted.</p> 

<p><strong>Riverview Park</strong> is situated in the extreme southeast part of 
the city, and in many respects is the most beautiful in its natural 
advantages of the city's parks. After resorting to condemnation 
proceedings and settlement by compromise, this park of 60 acres

is now in possession of the city at a cost of about $79,000. It is 
well covered with a valuable growth of young timber and is 
fortunate in its topography, comprising as it does a pleasing 
variety of the smooth and level surface, as well as the rough and 
more broken land so desirable in a park of this nature. At different points of the more elevated portions of the park a magnificent view can be had of the Missouri river for miles in either 
direction, which gives the park the significance of its name—
Riverview.</p> 

<p><strong>Bemis Park</strong> came under the control of the park board in 
1889. having been previously dedicated by a plat of Bemis Park 
Addition. This park consists principally of low ground following the ravine from 34th to 37th street, with steep hills on either 
side. It contains about 10 acres.</p> 

<p><strong>Jefferson Square</strong> is the only piece of ground within the 
boundaries of the city that is left of the original dedication as 
platted in 1854, being one block of ground between 15th and 16th 
streets and Chicago and Cass streets. Frequent attempts have 
been made to divert its use to other purposes, such as school 
grounds, market house, postofhce, city hall. etc.. but it still exists 
as a park. Located as it is, in the center of the city, it is a very 
popular resort during the summer season and is the only one 
accessible to the large number of the laboring class living in 
that vicinity.</p> 

<p><strong>Belt Line Park</strong> consists of 3 acres in the western part of the city. Little improvement has as yet been made.</p> 

<p>RESIDENCES.</p> 

<p>Omaha is distinctly a city of homes. The resident portion 
is thickly built up with houses, which give to the casual observer 
the impression, that they have been built for homes in the 
fullest sense of the word. The old part of the city lies about 
Capitol Hill, and here are many of the homes of the pioneer 
citizens. To obtain the best bird's-eye view of the finest residences 
in Omaha, let a visitor board a westbound Farnara street motor; 
when the car reaches the crest of the hill, at 36th street, there in 
every direction are to be seen homes valued at from twenty to

and contains some of the finest buildings in the city. South 10th. 
an older street, is lined on both sides.with handsome homes, set 
well back from the street and surrounded by well kept lawns. 
Georgia avenue, on the south side, is for the space of two miles 
evenly built up with moderate priced homes. Being- the direct 
road to South Omaha, it is considered a fine location. On the 
north side, adjacent to the Trans -Mississippi grounds, lies 
Kountze Addition. It bears the same relation to Omaha that 
suburbs do to larger cities, being the business man's home. The 
North 24th street and 16th street motor lines connect it with 
the city. </p>

<p>MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS. </p>

<p>Omaha, from its earliest history, has always been an important point in the military operations of the west. As the headquarters of the Department of the Platte is the base of supplies 
for the troops in the Indian campaigns, which took place almost 
every summer for a long period of years, Omaha is known the 
world over as a military city. This fact, with the influence of a 
regiment of regular troops stationed just outside the city limits, 
has so imbued the citizens with the martial spirit, that two companies of the National Guard were formed, and how well they 
have prepared themselves for the duties of the soldier, the record 
of their winnings in their various prize contests will show.</p> 

<p><strong>The Department of the Platte</strong>. The United States is divided 
into eight military divisions. That portion of the country occupied by the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming (except Fort 
Yellowstone, Wyo.,) and portions of Idaho and South Dakota 
form the Department of the Platte, with headquarters at Omaha,

and consists of thirty-five officers and 525 enlisted men, and a 
staff corps of two officers and seventeen men. It is located about 
twelve miles south of the city, and is reached by the Missouri 
Pacific railroad. There are also good roads for a carriage drive 
to the post, and in pleasant weather many visitors witness the 
daily drill of the soldiers. The 22d Regiment band, one of the 
best in the west, is one of the attractive features for visitors.</p>

time to the art of making money, they have not neglected to 
provide for those less fortunate. Besides the asylums and homes 
of various kinds, there are a number of larg-e and well equipped 
hospitals capable of receiving and caring for all who may apply. 
The following are the most important:</p> 

<p><strong>Creighton Memorial St. Joseph's Hospital</strong> was founded in 
1890. The Sisters of Mercy provided the grounds and a buildingwas erected out of a donation by John A. Greig-hton of over 
$200,000. The hospital is managed by the Sisters of St. Francis 
and about forty of who, as trained nurses, are in constant 
attendance on the patients. There are seventy-two private 
rooms, besides twenty-five wards, large and small, capable of 
accommodating more than 300 patients at one time. Aside from 
this there are operating rooms, dressing rooms, drug rooms, and 
private rooms for the officers. There is no restriction as to sex, 
creed or nationality. The hospital is free to those who cannot 
afford to pay, but the income for maintaining- the institution is 
derived from those patients who are able to pay for their care. 
Last year the total number of patients was 1339, of which 562 
discharg-ed their obligations, while 777 were cared for free of 
charge. The hospital is located on the northeast corner of Tenth 
and Castellar streets, and is best reached by the Walnut Hill 
and south Thirteenth street motor line.</p> 

<p><strong>Emmanuel Hospital</strong>, 3402 Meredith, was founded in 1890 by 
Rev. K. A. Foglestrom. It is managed by the Emmanuel Deaconess Swedish Association, under the general auspices of the 
Lutheran church. There is room for thirty patients, and all are 
admitted without restrictions, who are in need of careful nursing 
and medical attendance. "While this hospital also is maintained 
by the income received from patients, no one is refused 
admittance on account of poverty. This hospital is reached by 
the South Omaha and Sherman Avenue line.</p> 

<p><strong>The Presbyterian Hospital</strong>, located at Twenty-sixth and 
Marcy streets, was founded eight years ago. The pioneer supporters included a few charitable workers in Omaha and a small 
institution with less than a dozen beds marked the beginning. 
The demand for a more elaborate hospital have led to the equipment of the present building, with fifty beds, including private

wards, and completely appointed operating and dressing 1 rooms. 
A resident physician chosen from the graduates of the Omaha 
Medical College, with the assistance of a corps of trained nurses, 
look after the comfort of the patients, and carries out the orders 
of the regular staff of visiting physicians and surgeons. The 
hospital is entirely non-sectarian, and its patrons include people 
of every creed. The needs and care of the hospital are looked 
after by a board of trustees, which confers with this view from 
time to time with the medical and surgical staff. No case, except 
that of contagious diseases, is refused admittance to the hospital. 
The location of the building is a quiet one. and the rapid 
development of the institution speaks well for its promoters.</p> 

<p><strong>The Douglas County Hospital</strong> has a front elevation of 400 
feet and comprises a central building and two wings. It is 
located on tin- County Poor farm at the corner of Fortieth street 
and Poppleton avenue. It is maintained entirely by the county 
and is intended only for the poor. There are wards also for the 
county poor and insane. There is room for about 300 patients, 
and is usually taxed about one-half of its capacity.</p> 

<p><strong>The Clarkson Memorial Hospital</strong>, 1716 Dodge street, was 
founded by a bequest made by Bishop Clarkson, together with 
donations by hi- friends. It was first intended to he exclusively 
a childs hospital, hut adults are now admitted when the rooms 
are not occupied by children. It is under the general supervision of the Episcopal church, but patients of all denominations 
are admitted, and while it is known as a private hospital, it 
receives its share of the emergency cases sent by the city.</p> 

<p><strong>The Methodist Episcopal Hospital and Deaconess Home</strong> is 
located at 419 South Twentieth street. It has only thirty-five 
beds and is consequently nearly always taxed to its full capacity. 
It is under the care of a corps of trained nurses, who are doingactive and earnest work in relieving sickness and distress.</p> 

<p><strong>The Emma Flower Mission</strong> was founded by Mrs. Hoagdand 
in memory of her daughter Emma. Flowers are collected from 
all over the city and are distributed by a committee of ladies 
among the patients in the hospitals and private houses. "When the 
supply is over abundant, they are given to the poor of the city.</p> 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.120.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.120.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.120.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

<p><strong>The State Institute for the Deaf and Dumb</strong> is situated in 
the northwestern part of the city. It is supported by direct 
appropriations by the legislature. Its location is one of the most 
sightly about the city. Its buildings are of brick, surrounded by 
a beautiful lawn in the midst of a forest of planted trees. The 
original structure was erected in 1869, the others have been 
added from time to time as the necessities required. The object 
of the institute is to give those children of the state who, by 
reason of deafness, cannot be educated in the public schools, an 
education, and the physical and moral development which will 
make them good and self-supporting citizens. The intellectual 
work is carried on in two departments, the manual and the auraloral. In the former by means of the manual alphabet, writing, 
signs and pantomine; the latter by means of writing, speech reading and action work. An art school and manual training school 
is conducted for the benefit of the students, and many of them 
attain great proficiency. It is one of the most interesting places 
to visit about the city, and visitors are always welcome.</p> 

<p>There are a number of homes of various kinds about the city: 
the most important of which is the Nebraska Home for the Aged, 
at 1422 North Twenty-seventh street, and the St. James Orphanage at Benson. This latter institution, under the charge of the 
Sisters of Mercy, provides a home and school for about 150 
orphans.</p> 

<p>TRANSPORTATION.</p> 

<p>That Omaha is an important railroad point, is shown by the 
fact that 5,000 men resident in the city are directly engaged in railroad work. This city has more than twenty distinct lines of road 
affording direct communication with every city of importance in 
the United States, especially is this true of the cities and 
smaller towns of the Trans-Mississippi country. It is this 
magnificent system of railroads radiating to every point of the 
compass that gives to Omaha the commercial supremacy which 
she now enjoys. A glance at the various roads leading out of 
Omaha from all directions will indicate its importance as a railroad center. Leading to the east we have the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul, the Chicago &amp; 

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.121.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/large/transmiss.book.guide.1898.121.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/data_images/projects/transmississippi/figures/thumbnails/transmiss.book.guide.1898.121.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

Chicago, St Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha. Leading- to the north 
and northwest we have the Sioux City vS: Pacific, the Chicago &amp; 
Northwestern, and the Fremont. Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley. 
Leading to the west and northwest we have the Burlington &amp; 
Missouri River the Union Pacific: the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific, and the Chicago

Bluffs, the Missouri Pacific. Leading to the southeast we have 
the Chicago, Burlington St Quiucy, the Wabash, and the Kansas 
City. St. Joseph &amp; Council Bluffs.</p> 

<p>Omaha is situated 200 mile* nearer the Pacific Coast than 
any other city of importance on the Missouri river, thus insuring 
better rates and prompter service. The headquarters and chief 
officials of the Union Pacific and other large trunk lines are 
located here, while it is the division headquarters of most of the 
balance. Several of the Large eastern and southern roads are 
contemplating building into Omaha. That two at Least will do 
so is an assured fact, while the road* to the west are constantly building feeder* and thus opening up new territory to 
the wholesale and manufacturing interests of Omaha As the 
railroads now here have been built in response to the demands 
of the trade which centers at this city, so will other roads be 
built, as this trade increases with the growth of the county.</p>

<p>VIADUCTS AND BRIDGES.</p> 

<p>Three magnificent steel bridges span the Missouri river at 
Omaha, affording ample facilities for freight and passenger 
transportation to Council Bluffs and points beyond. The bridge 
of the Union Pacific Railway Company was completed in 1887 at 
a cost of over a million dollars. It is 1750 feet in length, 54 feet 
wide and has 10 spans. The bridge is 140 feet in height, 74 feet 
being below the level of low water. It will stand a pressure of 
over four tons to the square foot. It accommodates the greater 
part of the freight and passenger trains that cross the river at 
this point.</p> 

<p>The same year a new wagon and street railway bridge was 
built by the Council Bluffs &amp; Omaha Railway and Bridge Co. 
Its foundation consists of nine huge iron cylinders sunk to bedrock and filled with concrete cement. This bridge with its approaches is nearly a mile in length. 33 feet in width and 54 feet 
above high water. It accommodates the wagon traffic and street 
car service between Omaha and Council Bluffs.</p> 

<p>A new bridge connecting Council Bluffs with East Omaha 
was completed in 1893 by the Omaha Bridge &amp; Terminal Railroad 
Company at a cost of over a million dollars. It was intended as 
a quick outlet to the east for the manufacturing industries of 
East Omaha, and to facilitate the interchange of freight by the 
railroads coming into the city from the north with eastern roads. 
The bridge is intended for street car service as well as railroads 
and accommodates wagon traffic and foot passengers. As it is 
a low bridge, being only 10 feet above high water, and as it was 
necessary to provide for the passage of steamers on the river, it 
was built with a draw-span 521 feet in length. This is the longest draw-span in the world.</p> 

<p>All the railroads which run through the central part of the 
city are laid in the ravine which divides the northern and southern portions of the city in the eastern part. To eliminate the 
danger of railroad crossings and for the better accommodation 
of wagon and street car traffic, three large viaducts were built 
within a few blocks of each other. The Tenth street viaduct is 
probably the widest and most substantial in the country. It 
consists of a paved roadway on a steel frame 60 feet in width, 
with a stone walk 10 feet in width on either side This via-

duct accommodates several street car lines and is the main hack and carriage drive to the Union depot. It was built under the 
direction of the Union Depot Company at a cost of $250,000.</p> 

<p>The next viaduct is one block west of 11th street.</p> 

<p>The 16th street viaduct is one of the main thoroug-hfares of 
the city and is crossed by the Sherman avenue and South Omaha 
street car lines.</p> 

<p>HOTELS AND BOARDING HOUSES.</p> 

<p>Omaha is well supplied with a number of hotels of the first 
class, with many others which furnish good accommodations at 
a very moderate cost. The city is well prepared to entertain all 
visitors, however great the emergency, as the hotel facilities of 
Council Bluffs and South Omaha can be readily drawn upon, 
being but a few minutes' ride away. The combined capacity of 
the hotels of the three cities is sufficient to care for about 50,000 
guests. Aside from the hotels there is a vast number of boarding houses and private rooms with restaurants of all grades, so 
that it is safe to say, that during the exposition at least 100.000 
visitors can be easily and comfortably cared for at one time. 
Other hotels are in contemplation and several large buildings 
will be remodeled for hotel purposes, so that it is probable that 
this estimate can be considerably increased. The prices range 
from 50 cents and $1,00 to $4.00 and $5.00 per day, with the 
majority at $1.00 and $2.00 per day. The following is an alphabetical list af the principal hotels of the city:</p>

<p>CHURCHES.</p> 

<p>The total number of church buildings in Omaha is 107. On 
account of the multiplicity of congregations the tendency of the 
architecture is toward buildings that will accommodate small 
audiences. As compared with older cities the churches here are 
comparatively new and their architecture is consequently of a 
more modern style. The design of the congregations has been 
the comfort of the worshippers and the cultivation of the devotional feeling within rather than to arrive at an Imposing 
exterior. The prevailing type of architecture is a one-storied 
church, with the auditorium arranged after the amphi-theater 
Among the earliest pioneers of Omaha were ministers of the 
gospel, and their number has gone on increasing with the growtr. 
of the city until now more than one hundred pulpits are filled 
with able and infiuental men Nearly all of the leading denominations are well represented here, as the following directory will 
show:</p>

<p>CEMETERIES.</p> 

<p>Ample ground, desirably located, has been devoted to the 
various cemeteries about Omaha. The following comprise the 
list:</p> 

<p><strong>Forest Lawn</strong>—North of Fort Omaha; office 222 South 17th 
street.</p> 

<p><strong>Prospect Hill</strong>—Parker street.</p> 

<p><strong>Holy Sepulchre</strong>—Leavenworth and 48th streets.</p> 

<p><strong>The Bohemian</strong>—54th and Center streets.</p> 

<p><strong>German Catholic</strong>—24th street, south of city.</p> 

<p><strong>Mount Hope</strong>—Military avenue.</p> 

<p><strong>Pleasant Hill</strong> - 42d and Redick.</p> 

<p><strong>Russian Israelite</strong>—5109 North 24th street.</p> 

<p><strong>Springwell Danish</strong>—Redman avenue, west of city.</p> 

<p>BLOCKS AND BUILDINGS.</p> 

<p>The necessity of being in the business center for the proper 
transaction of business and the extremely high prices of real 
estate in that favored quarter are responsible for the "office 
building. " Under the old common law principle that real estate 
proprietorship extended downward in a gradually diminishing 
area until it reached a point at the center of the earth and upward in a gradually increasing area into illimitable space, possession is being taken by some of the modern builders. The 
foundation is begun many feet below the surface and is built up 
literally house upon house until the owner thinks he has solved 
the problem of how to make land worth $150,000 pay interest, 
running expenses and also leave a profit.</p> 

<p>To illustrate the immensity of one of these structures we take 
the Bee building as a model. While not the tallest the Bee 
building is probably the largest office building in Omaha, and at 
the time of its erection in 1889 was the largest newspaper building in the world It was built at a total cost of $500,000, including machinery and electric light plant. L,ike many modern 
office buildings, it is built in the form of a hollow square surrounding a central court. The court starts from the ground 
floor at the street level and rises to the height of 120 feet. It is

covered at the top with a clear ground glass skylight, supported 
by graceful wrought iron trusses. The roof weighs 375 tons, and 
paved as it is with vitrified brick embedded in Portland cement, 
would make a safe driveway for a score of loaded drays.</p> 

<p>The building has a ground dimension of 17.424 square feet. 
There are 465 windows in the outside walls of the building. In 
the east and south front there are 140,000 pressed brick and about 
1,000,000 of other kinds in the building and 18,000 feet of tiling. 
There are 850 tons of structural iron, 24 tons of sash weights, 148 
tons of tiling and 1005 tons of granite used in the construction, 
while 65,000 vitrified brick were required to cover the roof and 
150 barrels of Portland cement were required to lay them in. 
About 15 miles of pipe are laid in the structure, required b3^ the 
drainage system. There are 187 offices and rooms in the building, 
the largest of which is 89x44 feet and the smallest 8x15. About 
500 people are regularly engaged in their various avocations in 
this one quarter of a block and are visited by thousands of people daily. Owing to hydraulic elevator service the top floors 
are as valuable for rental purposes as the lower. The following

<p>STREET RAILWAYS.</p> 

<p>The street railway system at Omaha thoroughly meets the 
requirements of the public. The more thickly settled portions 
have been well covered for years and extensions are made from 
time to time to keep pace with the growth of the city. The last 
horse and cable line gave place a couple of years ago to the 
electric car and the whole system is now operated entirely by 
electricity. All lines, with the exception of a few suburban 
branches, are controlled by the Omaha Street Railway Co., which 
is officered as follows:</p> 

<p>Frank Murphy, president; Guy C. Barton, vice president; 
W. W. Marsh, treasurer; D. H. Goodrich, secretary; W. A. 
Smith, general manager; F. A Tucker, general superintendent;</p> 

<p>This company has a capital stock of $5,000,000. The general 
offices are at the corner of 20th and Harney streets. The entire
